AMs from Wales fear that the floods will appear as bollocks
There is a dispute among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This was raised as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them appear ridiculous .
AM Labourist said his group was concerned that this has the same sound as Twp and Pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: In the Welsh language  twp means white and pwp means bright.
AM of  Plaid said that the whole group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said his group had an open mind about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: 'The final decision on any description of what Members of the Assembly should call will naturally be a matter for the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which had broad support for the assembly to be called the Parliament of Wales.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could be a headache for the presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of what to call when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia leave to the public opinion in a referendum on the change in the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Upper Macedonia.'
The popular vote was established with the aim of finding a solution to a decades-long dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents it .
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a consequence of EU and NATO membership.
The Knights of St. Martin Stop Shouting as Churches in Harlem Are Sending
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, there is none".
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socializing differently" today.
'Bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis.'
As regards the churches, it is worrying that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders think, and today or tomorrow it will end up back where it started.'
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the local sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings are white carpenters", he said, "and thus, they will not be able to attend when the day comes to close for these churches because most likely many of these people who enter to live in these condoms will not become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by congregations of white Carnageans before Harlem became a metropolis of white Carnageans - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's ten years later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white Carnegie people left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black Carnegie people who were practicing the religion nearby took the title for the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a congregation of black carnival people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted retailers on 125 Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted the hiring or promotion of black carnival people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson's and successor to St. Martin's, was proud when he called the carillon the people's knife".
The expert who met the carillon in July called it another treasure: "a cultural treasure" and "a unique historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that she was the first carillon in the world to have a black carillon musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who attended the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's has not changed with anyone else.
What happened at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of experts and contractors, some introduced by lay church leaders, others by Episcopal dioceses.
The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would seek to pass the costs on to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in binding the experts and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A seahorse wounds a 13-year-old boy on his way to a hearing in California
A seahorse attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was headed to audition in California on the opening day of the audition season, officials said.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. at Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was walking with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he saw the boy crying for help and then went to help him with a group to help pull them out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of having a cat, but then realised that he was shouting, "Help me!
Give me your hand!'
Cut it and open the whole keyboard", Hammel said realising the moment the boy had arrived.
"I'm calling for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of seahorse responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media meeting that the shark had been in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with similar shelves to a department store of beauty products equipped with specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial £2.8 billion UK beauty market revenue, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods fall, larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will be rolled out to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use the space on the shelves that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty items it is offering to 3,000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Some existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space with brand areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also restart its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly being demanded by smaller buyers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to small-scale food purchases per day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to shop there.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the shops that discount the prices of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos' stores in shops and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted sales of the commodity and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate its beauty and grocery departments failed.
Sainsbury's is testing a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the link ended after a dispute over how to split the revenue from grocery stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came into effect after Sainsbury's sold the 281-store grocery business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare companies including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to various stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of companies has been designed to be suitable for every need and the attractive environment and convenient store positions mean that we have become a destination for beauty products of interest that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby cancels a £11m deal
Peter Jones's Dragons personality Den Peter Jones 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle firm's business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for the home-made products and accessories brand, Truly.
The pair business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning appeared on Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons personality Peter Jones very angry because he was cancelled from being part of their last-minute big-money lifestyle firm's business - to focus on its major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the hugely popular television personality admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his sprawling business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - had left him with insufficient time to dedicate to his household and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop's firm and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private villagers.
A source said: "Truly it was Holly's first priority.
It would be her long-term future that would fill her the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost here.
There is a full product store at Marlow's headquarters that is ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenters of This Morning, who are among the UK's most profitable personalities, could mean a cost of millions to the company due to a large investment in products ranging from clothes and candles to clothing and household goods, and the potential for further delays until its launch.
And it can mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her brother Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman president in March.
The couple travel together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the firm's ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's presenter of I'm A Celebrity.
Last evening, a source close to Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs".
Difficult meeting 'but then found love'
He was quoted as saying that he was going to be criticized by the news media for making a comment that some people consider to be "unpresidential" because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice that mimics that of a news anchor".
"I have given up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But denuclearization negotiations have ceased.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders on Saturday at the General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's early steps of disarmament.
The US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his demonstration speech.
He said, "We're doing well with North Korea".
"We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
Now we have this very good relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the end of rocket tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American veterans home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not necessary.
Even after more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to be displaced from their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is challenging", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on site.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pallu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still not well prepared for the great wrath of nature.
While a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, you don't see them as much along the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palos, despite a warning being issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has improved the infrastructure that is breaking Indonesia, the centre of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration gave up due to a lack of funds as he faces his re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Muslim and Christian gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows and cages and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scoring the same points at the last minute vs Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while 27 metres away from Chelsea's 1-0 away team.
He hit the ball a little to his left before shooting the ball into the rib.
The ball of l over most of the box as it ended up in the right side of  over the net.
Eventually, the ball fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to welcome it, and fell through the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming towards me and I touched the ball once and didn't think much about it and tried to shoot the ball".
Chelsea were winning 1-0 to half the game after scoring a 25 minute goal from the excellent Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before leaving to run towards the centre of the field and then quickly into the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly spread the ball into the middle of the field.
Then he shot the ball very nicely, which got Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defensive players and sent the ball across the net on the left foot and passed where Liverpool's Alisson Becker had gone.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday afternoon in London.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of the building that collapsed due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused high waves of up to 20 feet, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho news agency told a news conference.
The city of P Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am this morning wounded by a knife in Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged the people in the area who saw or heard something to speak.
Investigative inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I call on anyone who was in the vicinity of  John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to call on everyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have caught something on dashcam footage to contact me by having information that is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside property.
Today at noon friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police said they were in the process of informing the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by police that no one should be allowed to enter or exit the building.
He had no words when he became a tree tree.

The statue of Parliament of Cromwell becomes the last monument struck by the argument about rewriting history
Its removal would be a form of appropriate justice for destruction similar to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural artifacts carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "misguided" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his great-grandfather Thomas in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many believe to still be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shapes the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized individual figure representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated".
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 laying down the rules on the application of this Regulation.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the People's Republic of China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname 'Yuan,' was found dead of a severed artery, covered in blood near a slaughterhouse in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post.
Pig farmers prepare to inject vaccines into pigs in Hoggery on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Allegedly, he travelled with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 chickens on the market.
The next morning, his cook found the dead, and discovered a pig-shearing door in the open neighborhood.
He said that the flesh was covered with blood.
Forensic examination confirmed that the pig of  250 kg attacked the farmers and killed them, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and mutilated", said the cook, who referred to him by his nickname "Wu", as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was neither of Yuan nor of his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was stopped from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their ranch in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig kept a farmer from Wales with his tractor until his wife was eaten by the animal.
After a Oregon pig farmer attacked and ate him in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but blood taste can act as a "cause".
"They're playing.
They work, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to show them the appropriate amount of respect", he said.
The wreckage of the Rose Hurricane will bring heavy rainfall across the Southeastern United States
As predicted, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it moves through the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph at 5 o'clock eastern time on Sunday morning, and was located 385 miles in the direction of the Gulf of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a thunderstorm across the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the West Coast of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching thunderstorms will create heavy rainfall spread throughout the South in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and the possibility of desert landslides.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to fall by 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall are expected in parts of the Valley, especially over much of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible under conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It would not be a good idea to walk out into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring local winds and dust.
The storm will bring some rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small flows of cracks and draining roads.
This will be the first rainfall of their rainy season region.
Some tropical rainfall spreads will begin to reach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall becomes more widespread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spreads across Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there may be some strong changes in temperature across the United States as the Arctic cools, but tropical areas remain fairly warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a great example of dramatic temperature differences from the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
A large part of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spreading from the Southern Plains to parts of the Greys.
New York City can rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high possibilities for above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people saw the very interesting testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman he accused of committing an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming with the shocking last-minute news of Friday: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was drinking when he was under the influence of alcohol and tried to strip her clothes when they were a post-secondary-level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company was counting the average amount of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers are from offices.
To put this in perspective, it's the size of an audience similar to that for the decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion makers strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the top of the list of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was just behind it with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, protesters were caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and were yelling at him as he tried to get in the elevator for a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stood there staring down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, on a live CNN broadcast.
"Sitting here in front of you I am", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They say "you have power when many women have nothing".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minorities have long been urging.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was powerful, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of taking advantage of Brexit policy
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of taking advantage of politics and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview after one with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's tariffs was 'fully justified'.
The shooting on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released footage of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his ammunition during the fight.
Police recovered the nuclei from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate, WAFB, reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is giving credit to the Louisiana State Police's criminal force task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for "diligence and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2, 6-foot-4 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "lost" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what I worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano throws ash over Mexico city
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention has warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring various sounds and tectonic movements.
Images on social media showed thin layers of sand that folded car windscreens in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geography physicists note an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital following a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police have a clash with separatists from Catalonia ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A facial-covered separatist group held back by the police against riots, their eggs and dust painted, and created a cloud of dark dust in the roads that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also small clashes during the day and the police had to use the lembubi to control the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't apologize" to fight against Unionist protesters who were chanting, "Spain Forever".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries they received in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remained high in the region which wants independence a year after the referendum of 1 October was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters chose to become independent with great difficulty, although participation was low with those opposed to secession who had a major boycott of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were detained last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my mother and father crying with joy because they could vote but now we are alone", he said.
Despite a vital and decisive victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are sending to maintain this year's momentum with many of their best-known leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial due to their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There is more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial last year, announced he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car broke into a home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a house in Londonderry more than once.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage was caused to the stairs and the building itself.
A crossbow was also used to fire at the car at some point.
Goal of  Menga winning the game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the game
Livingston, who was promoted, beat Rangers and thus Steven Gerrard lost for only the second time in 18 games as coach of Ibrox's club.
Dolly Menga's ball splitting made all the difference as Gary Holt's side was tied in points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a single out of their Premiership home this season and next Sunday will play Hearts, who are first and second by eight points.
Prior to that game, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna at their Europa League home ground on Thursday.
While Livingston went on to have a six-game division loss, with head coach Holt having not missed a game since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lose opportunities against sloppy visitors
Holt's team had a long winning streak before he had a goal, with his direct style of play causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but he passed the ball in front of the basket, then Alan Lithgow could only pass the ball wide after he slipped to get the ball from Craig Halkett's head-stroke near the basket.
Those who were playing on their own ground were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they were the visitors who could cause them problems at certain times.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
Rangers let the free kick in and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and put it in the basket from the center of the box.
By that point, Rangers were dominating the ball possession, but they were finding the defense of the team they were playing on their own ground, impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not much of a problem,
That style of play continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to take the ball.
Scott Pittman was unable to find a goal due to Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow fired the ball wide after passing another Livingston player.
Blalen were always in Livingston's box and always removed from their players, while two requests for a penalty - after Halkett's attempt on replacement Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
The following table shows the results of the study:
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this third trajectory above.
The style of play and their staff have changed little since returning to the main battle, but the most credit should go to Holt for the way he has brought the team together since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was very good at his games, organising an immensely well-organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in check.
However, Rangers had a lack of inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at certain times under Gerrard, there was a lack of good standards at the time.
Their last ball shot was not good - he only managed to break the team's defence that he was playing on his own ground - and it's a sign for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan received different reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), crowds gathered and a blue sky was lit as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters turned around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - mostly Kurds - also voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them into the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to certain German Turks and is thought to be an autocrat from others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The arrest took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The crash happened a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car and continued to walk on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash last Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officials were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and deviations of buses are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are in disarray
Six prison officials were detained following a riot in a high-security men's prison, the Bureau of Prisons said.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialised officials "Tornado" have been deployed to address the disorder, which involves eight prisoners and is located in one of the sections.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year anti-riot officials were called to the prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with the bullets of the pool.
The Rose Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Flooding of Malar (Dry Areas may Benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this will likely happen early next week as the remaining energy from the Rose Hurricane flows through the Desert Belt, leading to rapid flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already established a rapid flood watch for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday in the rain.
The National Phoenix Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical weather or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with AZ".
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center project from 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Belt including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have from 2 inches to 4 inches, with possible isolated totals.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, Rosa rainfall can be a positive thing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, little of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the near side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring device, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, reported by weather.com.
First, the route of the Rosa hurricane leads to the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, which will remain a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific and is therefore losing its strength.
Thus, it is expected to touch Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday late afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be severe, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then will move from Arizona and southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or its wreckage is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. wetland desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to produce rapid flooding and flooding in the deserts, and valleys in the mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested following assassination attempts
Three teenagers and a man aged 20 were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenager was found injured by a knife in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in an Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
Adolescents aged 17, two aged 18 and a man aged 20 were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who could have a video of what happened to speak from his mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh sent the Democratic Party's anger and rage
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "send the rage and anger of the Democratic Party during his nomination process".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on its allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's bravery and quality and courage".
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I never contested, but in truth, I am contesting", he said.
"So I'm running everywhere, fighting for very good candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP's leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with deaths seemingly increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many injured as huge waves hit beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when a wave up to six metres (18 ft) high came down on the ground as the darkness began, with many injured and dead and everything in the middle destroyed.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately get up to run and end up with casualties", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not occur alone, it dragged cars, trucks, houses, destroyed everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at speeds of  800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palos.
Aerial photographs from the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges spinning over and falling, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Strong skirmishes continued to attack the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in the statement that the energy emitted from the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said the geography of the city, which is located at the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have guessed the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had fallen.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the disasters and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 mi) coastline to the north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally dispatched and without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse, they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing Palu of a tsunami, although officials said the wave had arrived on time.
In a video of the amateur shared on social media, a man on the roof of a building can be heard shouting tsunami warnings as he approached people on the underpass.
Within minutes a huge amount of water had poured down the roof, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe blackout that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The authorities said the military had started sending freight aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other basic needs.
The city airport reopened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Pallu on Sunday.
The number of deaths well exceeds 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and full in the city of Palu, where the employees are staying in armed tarpolin shelters in their office building, they have been through scenes of devastation on their way there, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "They told me they saw many houses destroyed.
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep skills were not allowed to travel to Palos.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"There is a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can get international assistance but there is no status at the moment".
On the second night in Palos after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would make this story of natural disasters come true.
On Saturday, a young boy came out of the drain.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under a rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight", he said.
Mr Gendon related how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he discouragedly sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only marked that he left, but did not mark his arrival.
"I think that means the messages didn't come", he said.
Allegedly taking $26,750 while the ATM was refilling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was pulling an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his work, another man "came behind the Brinks employee" and stole a purse of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man who was formerly known as Kanye West"
West, 41, has been playing Ye for some time and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means int", West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with Big Boy's radio host.
"Then I, you, I we, she, we.
From Kanye meaning "the one", to just Ye - simply a reflection of what we have right, wrong, what bothers us, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
As one who collaborated with  West, JAY-Z, also plays with or without sing and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody rally against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the military to restrain the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing around 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal groups.
The United States shall double the funding for I.A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made AI notices, even though there is a lack of a formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be first in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are much further back than the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in AI", said Lee.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major AI acquisition will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of  Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the highest-rated American Othello player, and later was an executive with Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when it would be the next one, to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said that researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing academic leaders; corporations are doing it,.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed people who inspire others from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen its AI efforts.
He said, "I believe that the green paper should be automatically offered to people with a PhD in AI".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Science Foundation of China provides funds to people in similar academic institutions to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
More than a decade ago, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the NSF, more than $100 million a year is currently invested in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation attempting to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has seen no action for several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the 'Republic of North Macedonia', a step that resolves a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its bids for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the island in its north represents a possibility of occupying its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the population of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether participation would reach the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: 'You are in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece.'
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the name change giving him the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was throwing a small stall and preparing seats in front of the armed factions by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we must go proudly under our own conditions, not by commanding others", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If we do not accept ourselves as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favour of the name change would be "a confirmation of our future".
A survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - an amount below the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation should be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it represents the first serious blow to the government's policy in favour of Western ideologies since it took control of the country in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, player of Manchester City, passes all of Brighton's defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his 65th-minute goal seem very easy.
The Argentine striker received a ball from the half-ground at the start of the sequence.
It was run by three Brighton defenders before it was run into open space.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green floors.
He fought one defender before fleeing much further to the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he spread the ball over his left and found Sterling.
The English striker first touched the ball in the box to re-shake Aguero, who used his right foot to insert the ball into the right side of the net by counting it from where Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan was.
"Aguero is sending some problems in his quest", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in Premier League fighting.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the Brighton area in that action.
He sent the right ball to Leroy Sane on the left side very nicely.
Sane touched the ball a little before he got to Sterling where he lasted.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball a little and put it in the net just before it slipped into an unlikely territory.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the decisive game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But the highly competitive player Scherzer hopes he can be the pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have the possibility to play in the decisive game, which is ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West by one game.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to continue their run with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can have the chance to win knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is crowded and the other team is likely to be playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
Do you want to compete in those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, had a practice session on Thursday and will be pitching on Sunday when he is generally at rest.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump demonstrations in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we've done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's very big -- I'm not competing, but in fact, I'm competing so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates, he said.
"We're seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happening now", Trump continued.
And they are determined to take back power by using every possible means, you can see the horror.
They don't care who hurts, who wants to fly to get power and control, who wants power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats had a mission to "resist and hinder".
"And I've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and green and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred Democratic Senator ranked in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by her name, and received much negative criticism from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you get the Document?
Uh, uh, what's that?
No, uh no, wait, first of all-- her body movements were not positive at all--the worst movements I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
It does not tolerate those who communicate their views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, they didn't take it too seriously.
After all, I am the most recent MP on the list of Labour MPs who have not been received positively - because we have communicated our views.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion for censorship criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues to those on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Council meetings of the week in the evening were exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of the most compassionate and kind politics that has ever been felt if, in fact, it ever really started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took over, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political understanding began to expect me to change my understanding and take positions I never agreed with in other situations - whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and, in fact, I don't care what I say - they follow me on social media with a demand to remove me from my MP position, denounce the centre's politics, and tell me I am not part of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face many sexual or racist abuse every day but never hide from comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party becomes a party.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, to not be so vocal and then everything goes well".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by Thatcher's government's negligence which left my comprehensive school class literally in a disastrous state, I have sought to improve public services for those most in need - either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to devote my time and energy to my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to work for you and I tell you that no amount of threat to remove me from office or political campaign discourages me from acting on those who I believe are in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have not lost once, climbs to the top of the standings
Two attempts could slightly alter the outcome, but there was no doubt that Ayr was entitled to win this exciting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
They are currently ranked first, the only team out of all ten that has not lost once.
In the end, it was the superior defense, as well as their ability to seize the opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing in its own ground, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have had trials during our games this week, and we still haven't missed one, so I feel happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We gave the credit to Ayr, they took advantage of better opportunities than us".
With Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, however, a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was allowed to play the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's win by penalty, before, in the middle of the game exactly, he scored a goal and converted an individual attempt to make the points 17-5 for Ayr at break.
But Melrose started the second half of the game well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
He then stopped the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who came off the ground on a stretcher, and as soon as the game resumed, Ayr continued to score after an attempt by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's chief agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out aggressively when they made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of heavy pressure.
However, the team playing at his own ground began to attack again, and when he was given a yellow card by Struan Hutchinson for the action he took on Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground on the back of the progressing Ayr group.
Climo converted, as he did for another time almost from the area from which the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up the ball that met David Armstrong from the box and sent Gregor Henry, who was playing on the side, for the fifth attempt of the side that she was playing on her own ground.

The personality of  Still Game Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he has been named as the director of  a company of  licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor who plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine series will be the last one of the program, and it appears Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from Scottish Sun said Kiernan was seeking to get involved in the Glasgow restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen a passageway to the Pacific
Seafarers are on guard at the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building shall bear a blue flag in the colour of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
Around all of Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still clear - as is the desire for Bolivians to be able to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and serenity, and obviously is looking forward to the outcome with a positive mind", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICC decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will find, in favour of Bolivia's statement, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign call to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has a lot to lose in Monday's decision.
'We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean,' he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and that it would change little if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the Court of Justice came only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was not complicated said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring the case of Bolivia, the last four years have not been helpful.
'The issue of access to the sea has been raised by the current Bolivian administration,' said Zárate.
Morales' hostile rhetoric has weakened any remaining Chilean deviance, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not had ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually speedy.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to reverse the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place until it can trust the United States
Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons he is first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on pace to resume the stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He says he is "hopefully in the void that continued sanctions and the United States' objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will never force North Korea to surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing weapons that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest collection of massive headwear to be seen in major stores.
If you want to add to your church collection or completely cover the sun, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of bizarre and very large headwear for their 2019 Spring and Summer collection on the runway that opened the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical chapters are showing up a lot on Instagram this summer and these designers are putting their amazing creations on the stage.
The object most striking by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a broad, wire-like shaft that completely covered the models' faces.
Other very large accessories included jewel-covered gold, a latex cap and even pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Most of the coloured masks had woven socks and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled the instrument device complete with snorkels and goggles, while another resembled a cone of melted ice.
And if you continue this way - good luck.
Fashion fans predict that huge bonnets will soon appear in the main stores.
The very large chapel comes out after the release of 'La Bomba', the two-foot-wide-shaped boy's hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label responsible for the unpractical hat that has appeared so much on social media has released another big creation on the stage - a boy's basketball that is almost the size of the fashion model she was wearing.
The dark orange raffin basket, surrounded by the young raffin spider and white leather patches, was the most prominent creation in Jacquemus's 2019 Spring and Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I look forward to seeing big seaweed hats and baskets in the main stores for the next summer - as the designer has made a huge impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very big accessories.'
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, which was continued in 2018 by another set of excellent exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement personalized school curricula, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If they speak in his own language, he understands their heart".
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent examinations this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher A grade.
Data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved a Higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, kept in the same regard as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and other buildings.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers to the fact that they are sending them to fill vacant jobs, 17 per cent were attributed to language skills deficiencies.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you learn another language, you will have a real advantage in the future as you have the ability to stay that way throughout your life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation and, by 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage.
That is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK as we look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at present, in a global business environment, that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and therefore this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should truly be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It is a good thing.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday, LeBron will play his first game against the Lakers in San Diego.
LeBron James' sports fans didn't expect him to start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the season opener game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the amount of minutes to play remains to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the season begins.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, Youtube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a wave of late-night campaign demonstrations in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first demonstration of five scheduled next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his election to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November elections are held.
What time is Trump's demonstration in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's demonstration in West Virginia online below via a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to address this week's Supreme Court nomination hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, which have become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with Senate confirmation delayed by a week during the FBI investigation.
But the primary purpose of this wave of demonstrations is to help the Republicans face the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities, according to Reuters.
Congress Control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we get to the busy campaign season, a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters who declined to be named.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state that won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is missing the interview.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to push him into the poll", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA determined not to give up on Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, the foursomes of the evening Sabbath could have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sport concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so in such competitions.
So where do they say the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now they're four, so I think we're taking this as a little momentum", Jordan Spieth said as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead with a further twelve being played.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel but little trouble and have a lot to encourage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each boasting three out of four points.
Spieth was precise from tee to green and leading by example.
That heartfelt cry of celebration continued to grow as he continued his round, making a crucial pitch to bring the fourth game even when he and Thomas were two-downs behind two.
His 15-game winning pitch was met by a similar shout, the kind that tells you to believe the American team is still there.
"You really have to go deep and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's what each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with the most points from Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sweet couple are four-fourths and considered perfect.
Moliwood were the only couple who did not sleep on Saturday afternoon bogey, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine o'clock Sunday morning bogey.
That race, and the way their energy seemed to flow both to and from this lively crowd establishes that they are the players offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win as the sun sets on Le Golf National from Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
But here we are talking about a European glory that is still early.
Watson's father and Webb Simpson were quickly joined by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foursballs, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a trap they never managed to get close enough to get out of.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to look at because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a second.
Europe played better as a team so it came down and was ahead on the final day but this foursomes session also showed that the US Team has the determination that some, especially from the US side, were doubting.
Europe ahead by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after emerging from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes ahead of the United States 10-6.
Inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari struggled with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, ready to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side that went wrong in the morning's foursballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but could not reach the score difference.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 games of one Sunday player to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who met Molliwood after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After dominating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs then worked outstandingly to beat the unlooked-for-optimism Woods and season new American player Bryson Dechambeau with an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who found difficulty in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, a star for the morning fourballs, returns to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But not everything went as Europe had hoped on a beautiful day, with a little rest in the Paris area.
Jordan Spieth, a three-time major winner, and Justin Thomas set the American limit by two points on Saturday.
They scored a bold 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
It was only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team returned by a four-point margin while entering the singles, although the holders of the Furyk side need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's contract seems to be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will by no means disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a phased denuclearization approach in which North Korea was being rewarded as it took steps, his statement appeared significantly to not reject unilateral, thoughtless denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to reduce the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on denuclearization first and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their objective in a coherent manner, and even objects to the declaration of an end to the war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can break us is a dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence.
We haven't heard of plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the party to this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have led to such a blockade.
Nevertheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the continental US land of North Korean rockets was inevitable after President Trump called Kim Jong-un on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to totally destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions should remain in place until North Korea declares nuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for it, saying "If you take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday told the UN Security Council that: The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we achieve fully and definitively verified denuclearization.
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 with a view to halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited Korea over three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after North Korea was criticized for making gangster-like demands within hours.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to disarm a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes corresponding measures.
He said Kim had told him that the corresponding measures he was seeking were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on taking enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in making all of its undergraduates sleep more with the aim of fighting the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake by caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's top university often have no idea about the basic truths about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which first started this year, explains to students the essential things about how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains an image of a student bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, cups, trainers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance will be affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that you will not change students' behaviour right away.
But I believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, and good-quality, sleep should be a student's secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain, since lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler draw up the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course around the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduating students to do a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they go to bed, as well as when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which can upset your circadian rhythm, and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal of  Menga loses to Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of sadness playing outside their home country as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox side were looking to record their first win as they traveled from their 4-1 triumphal win of February at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's side only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points away from the Ladbrokes Premiership's top leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the list of missing Rangers players never seemed to be going strong.
While Rangers are now relegated to sixth place, Livingston is relegated to third and only behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a broken leg injury after apparently being subjected to an object by the team's fans who played abroad.
Gerrard made eight changes in the side that passed Ayr for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-trained form has consistently hampered their opponents.
Rangers could dominate possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had only two minutes left from the start when the first-ever play-off of Menga sent Scott Pittman for Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' strong free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defender partner Alan Lithgow could only bounce back.
Rangers gained control but it seemed there was more hope than belief about their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a penalty on the 15th minute mark as he and Steven Lawless agreed but referee Steven Thomson ignored the appeals of the Kombijan.
Rangers managed to aim well for only two shots in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head-stroke and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that they were only entitled to their effort.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs's seven-piece well.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher drove the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga to finish the action.
Gerrard reacted at the brake by changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger drove to Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston went on to attract visitors to play exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett catching a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their position on the front in the final stages but McGregor kept well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went into the open from the bench.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late request for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but again Thomson looked the other way.
German: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our German of Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, like today 136 years today, and WE ARE GETT... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the  Geiger's Gauge.
As a science figure since then, the Geiger Count has become a pop culture foundation as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which features those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: Is that the one in the dumps?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these caps, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive atoms on minerals.
Evans: Say, she's definitely popular now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention itself is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect cells with abnormal behavior
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect abnormal cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cells with abnormal behavior as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, which are transformed in a laboratory
They may then see a common protein for many cancers and then re-inject
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A vaccine-treated woman, who teaches the immune system to recognize cells with abnormal behavior, saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so they can see a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 provokes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to patient immunosuppression and learning how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of type 2 leukemia.
Kanye West made a verbal attack in favor of Trump, while wearing a mask of MAGA, after his stay on SNL.
This Is Not a Good Mark
Kanye West was booed in his studio during Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great poster, he began speaking out against the Democrats and voiced his support for Trump.
I often talk to a white person and they say, "How can you please Trump, that racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I'd leave America, he said.
SNL began the program with a sketch comedy featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's video is leaked on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make you feel West when he posted it.
In addition, West complained to the audience that had caught him after the complaint about his publishing.
I'm boiled after the quint.
He said, "Don't go out there with that message".
They're boiling me!
Then they say he's lost, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the lost? " and he continued saying that he would have put on my superman's hat, because that means you can't tell me what we're doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.
His comments have caused at least two outbursts from the audience and SNL cast members appeared embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "There was a big silence throughout the studio".
West brought him as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as Perrier's Flixkun.
West had the support of the president of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous spirits: GRAZZZZIE THINGS TO THE FOLLOW".
But presenter Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply what he was and this is a beautiful thing in mind.
But I have NOT chosen to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So much more we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now what he was formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of  Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The former rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and naturally the music legend who is no longer with us Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder on the shoulders of a barista in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder after a man was stabbed in the neck at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is talking about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor spoke of the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that roles like these on screen mean that young people often feel they need to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something went wrong and had doubts about how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has strong interests in addressing the issue.
Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?, he said.
What are we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its highly masculine characters.
He continued: "What is natural and old, teacher?
Do I teach on TV, and on the streets, that makes the young man feel like he wants to be that certain side of a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because it's very clear that something went wrong for the young man.
In the interview he also admitted that he will not be making prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, saying that it will be war and horses.
From November Kit will appear in the new production of Sam Shepard's True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a left-hander.
Recently the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this programme, so this is how I see my future family, and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% surge in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been gender-transmitted, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, one year on, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member disclosed GOP senators' data, says dangerous lies and confusing theories
US Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being circulated by pundits and ultra-right websites.
Lying, lying and more lies of the perpetrators, Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came shortly after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the office of  Waters and released the information of a  Waters staff member, reported the Hill.
This baseless allegation is completely false and utterly false, Waters continued.
My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and utterly false.
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is one of anger", Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It shall not be resistant.
The applicant shall not question the motives of the applicant.
It must be calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to be matching Waters's reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the critics who appeared too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will run for the seat of Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his voice on Twitter.
This is a big deal if it's true, he said on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had warned the appropriate law enforcement authorities and entities about these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed, continued,and that we will be held legally accountable for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to each and every member of my staff.
Criticism of Johnny English Strikes Again by Rowan Atkinson, imitation of a weak peace
It has become traditional now to look for Brexit interpretations in any new film from a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of the Johnny English action-comedy imitation franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
The ironic auto-setting on the subject of how obviously bad we are, is the opportunity for the country's new export?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his big eyes and moving parts of his face was not as usual granted a renewed license for a second time to do everything wrong - that name more than anything shows that he is a widespread comic creature designed for territories of non-English-speaking movie goers.
Of course it's the stupid secret agent who despite his strange pretensions to his sweet fashion has a little Clouseau, a hat of Mr Bean and a big piece of that guy who contributed a note to the theme tune of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
It is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man who Atkinson had once played his part in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, after leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I liked the moment Johnny English was approached by helicopter while wearing medieval decorative clothes and the screw cap caught his son for a while.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels rather poor and exaggerated in a strange way, especially since the brands of the film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer comedy as a confident ingredient.
The humor feels as if it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's strange unfortunate incidents were not as inventive and focused as the silent film scene of Atkinson in the character of Bean.
The current permanent topic is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's highly classified web network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent who was on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the cake-on-the-cake cherry for the prime minister who is an imposing figure and a hardship, already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that any active spy compromised, she'll have to bring someone out.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in elegant buildings, but giving informal lessons on how to become an operative infiltrator: a good read here as English offers a School of Rock-style dance academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former partner of great patience, Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, a submarine commander, a one-woman role played by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is somewhat loose.
Thus the two inseparable, always confusing in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, when they encounter the character of a seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the rule of the soft tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of fake fun behavior: dressed as waiters, set fire to a high-end French restaurant, create chaos to board the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English begins a complete anarchy as he tries to use Virtual Reality casks to familiarize himself with the interiors of Volta's home.
Certainly all the stops lead to that last sequence, but as friendly and animated as he is, he has little idea of children's television.
Something rather moderate.
And like Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly deserves his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that will see Britons work a four-day week - but pay for five.
The party allegedly wants the company teachers to pass the remnants of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution on to workers by giving them another free day.
This will see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still taking the same pay.
Sources said the idea would be in line with the party's agenda and economic plans that the country is turning to favour workers.
The four-day shift was approved by the Tredijonjins Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: An expected policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen from today to tomorrow but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the worker-friendly economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not currently being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it.
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from anonymous directors and those who take advantage of utility companies.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all their shares as a Labour government can make a reduction based on perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on board companies and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their understanding
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court this week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Right, and sure, Kennedy said.
I said I and intervened in the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I nodded after it happened, after that allegation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.
However, Graham's vote, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it must be a very big charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know a tree, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone mentioned can verify this.
She is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and What Has Been Done to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a very impressive list of upcoming stars and an equally impressive mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people enter Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representative group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (until you were ready to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or actions such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making a phone call or some other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism - people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
As of 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions from its supporters, which can be used for a number of different purposes.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific target group for the group.
The group estimates that the current safe funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of committed investors and implementers who help children grow to their full potential, promising Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website that asks what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we have more power when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to be featured at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States uses the Navy to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
If necessary, Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleges that Russia's expansion in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is to want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe, he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that establishes itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
The economic option over Iran and Russia is, more or less, the gear and replacement of fuels, he said, referring to Russia as someone with a single mind with an economy that relies on fuel.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to strengthen its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, by replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to pressure Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin the "capital of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Be Good-Tested If She Does Not Run for President in 2020, Says the Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would carefully consider whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering leaving.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman in the top position", she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, we will examine whether or not we stand for president.
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was direct in her criticism of Trump and his nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said "Naturally we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think she should stand for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's likely voters said the senator should not run for election, according to a survey by Suffolk University's Center for Political Research/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the election.
The survey showed further support for the election by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential election exit and 48 per cent against it.
Other high-profile Democrats who have been discussed regarding a potential exit to the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD of Track Palin in the demonstration of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can relate to other families who are feeling the ramifications of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with", she told the audience at a demonstration for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the obvious problem that no one is addressing and said about her son and other war veterans, they are returning a little different, they are returning stronger, they are asking if there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, have for the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman with domestic violence, while intercepting a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while under arrest, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support a challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy to deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district on Friday brought a case of a friend of a Washington court to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the actor in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and the boys members of his violent gang abused her but US officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, producing large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations face pervasive gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a statement, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said that the new policy would re-establish decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a motive violates this principle, said the case of a friend of the court.
Lawyers argued that immigrant denial would harm the US economy, saying they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June
Asylum was never intended to address all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts dispersed in Palos as the number of dead doubles in a time-out fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly dire.
"It's very intense", said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she was holding her baby with fever at an evacuation centre in the unfortunate town of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents appeared to return to their destroyed homes, searching their stuff submerged in water, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the back and shoulder, remained outside the Palua Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to their continuous strong shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he related that he felt the violent earthquake move the floor of the fifth-floor hotel he was using with his wife and daughter.
There was no chance of saving ourselves.
I was rushed to the wall, I think, Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at the wedding venue.
I heard my wife scream for help, then I shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying  b propaganda advertising 
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a daily US newspaper trying to sell the reciprocal benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of  China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of  Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, accusing China of denying it.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a campaign escalating from Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a escalating trade war that is leading to rounds of tariffs on each of their imports.
China's retaliation tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a blog post in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this bullying by making propaganda ads in our own free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and the free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
Contrary to that, on the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited circulation voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic trajectory, since the media is under the constraint of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided an offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are aligning women voters before the midterm elections with Kavanaugh's debate, analysts warn
As many top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while facing several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned they would see an adverse reaction, particularly in the midterm elections.
The emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they wanted to run for office.
These things cannot be turned back, Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute stunt for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday's tree - they will not remember it tomorrow or even in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate chamber as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to run for Kavanaugh's nomination despite the statement by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be of a very high level, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst at the news site.
People are saying they were already high; and true.
But they may be higher, particularly among female voters turning up in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while displeasing to the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that an adverse reaction could follow if the Republicans lead with confirmation.
"This has become a full-fledged push for the GOP", Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans are handling this situation and how they are dealing with it, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elevate Democrats, told the news station.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who believes in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little more support for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his statement, while 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's hit, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week to Kavanaugh as he was the victim of her attack at age 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at the party while studying at Yale in the mines.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a new business that seeks to compete against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made it clear that the intention behind Inrupt is world domination.
We need to do it now, he said of the new business.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online store of personal data or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one and all at the same time.
What makes the online store of personal data unique is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information.
The company calls this personal data automation.
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought in by IBM, some staff developers who have a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they should introduce a complete change where all their business models turn from bottom to bottom from today to tomorrow.
We do not ask their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm an immense optimist for this next web era", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Cleric of the Victoria Cross of World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his village 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
Sabbath uncovered a memorial stone from his two nephews in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was brilliantly symbolic that the stone was to be dug exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize winner.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Kur brought his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with heavy fire and mud from on-site snipers and machine guns".
He later rushed to the fire line and with the greatest courage he reached the front line before going to a skirmish on the spot alone and losing three of his senses.
Lieutenant Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandmother's actions were "something I know I can never get there but something very humiliating".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also sat a girdle behind the parade, which was led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to have played a part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero was being shown by the support that many people will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peppa Pig
Imagine that you have been up all night watching Bellator 206 packed to end up being denied the main event.
The San Jose list included 13 fights, including six on the main card and were being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were alarmed when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they stayed up until the early hours especially for the fight.
One Twitter partisan described the change to children's cartoons as some kind of "goofy rain".
It is a government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not appropriate so they had to turn to children's programmes, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Pigs pepper, yes.
Belator's president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, we can probably fix something", Coker said.
But now it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to make it to Monday of our time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast went off there were many messages going on and not all were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can tell you that next time it's not going to happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and try to get more to the fans and instead go too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic runner Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that lost the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until secondary school that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
While appearing as a spoiled person on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt less than others he was growing up because it was socially unacceptable to please boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, those emotions that you feel less about, and feel different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile promoter for LGBT people and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to live freely without branches and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - US film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - it was a surprise for him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
When he went through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find anyone of his age who had experienced similar beautiful and heartwarming experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his overall perspective had changed.
If you had challenged me last year, the most important thing for me was that I wanted to win a gold medal, he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him you'd be here to be in the front row, he said.
"I was holding my hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to go to a crowd from countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Proud by Heather Small - which was compatible with him on the Olympic march and still holds the bar.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson who is no longer in shape remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his shape to avoid being a less than happy major stage.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was left on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being the centre of action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time grand winner spent his day between supporting and working on his game from a distance in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never giving the ball right even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where the long shelf distance once and for all punishes wrong shots.
And if the course alone is not heartbreaking enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joins season-new Tommy Fleetwood, to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points less than the start of the 12th single game, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game can prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, tapped me on the back and put his hands around me and said it would be done tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably never saw him play two games.
I saw more, but that's the way it worked and that's the way we thought it would go.
He must be out there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will be surpassing Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may mark the end of the Ryder Cup career which has almost never reached the completion of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible things to the team.
"He's old-fashioned, sarcastic, humorous, likes to hang out with people, and a very nice guy to have in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was fun to watch.
It provides much more than just games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the large front position can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a position on the front of the pitch before the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a comfortable trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans but ended up with a very poor margin, a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
Remind yourself that we had a great front position at Valderrama; we had a great front position at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but with little, Bjorn said, in the press, after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be ahead of them by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow is your soul and your body.
Go out there and do all the good things.
It's not over until you get the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we are trying to achieve is this trophy, and the focus should remain there.
I always said, focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the biggest players in the world.
Pleased with his players playing on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "He never steps beyond me in this.
There is a different challenge ahead.
Tomorrow concerns the individual benefits we see, and this is something different to do.
It's very nice to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested for your full ability as a golfer.
This is the message you want to pass on to the players, who come out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave the partner behind you and he will go out and get his best, too.
Unlike Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking to get his players to play better individually than they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as Europe made the Miracle of Medina.
I remember at least one word from it, he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players before the final day.
Tomorrow we have 12 big games, but you want to get to that start as soon as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medina.
When that one-sided momentum comes, it puts a lot of pressure on those half-parts.
We made our list properly and put those men down the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do some miracles tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men this way because I think it covers the whole road", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War frigates, but will not be available until at least next year due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the famous new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman for the military.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic issues of the ship's post-delivery have increased the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships which ordered the Navy back in 2007 will be supplied as a replacement for the serving Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a strong cannon, missile display against aircraft and against ships as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - this should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuing delays mean that the latest technology vessels - which have allowed Germany to project power beyond its will - will already be obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate of bad luck appeared in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivering it.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but German media quoted a number of crucial software and hardware flaws that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workers on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the vessel has a very excessive weight which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz of  7,000 tonnes is understood to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
This is said to have reached a shocking amount of  €3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from the initial €2.2bn.
The problems of the newest freighters are becoming especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently lacks deployment-supporting vessels.
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as old vessels were commissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust mentions the secret life of the night-goat
New research on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how night owls use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of flying single mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pipistrelles and sopranos as well as long-eared night frogs and Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track the nightlife activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of the sound of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the nighttime call of the frog and which species is doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced that will create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important for the night herring and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain nightlife trees and other associated species.
The population of the night-time snail in Scotland and around the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting houses and habitat loss.
Wind and light turbines can also pose a risk, as can insect-catching poison paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The night owls are not actually blind.
However, due to their notorious hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when they come to catch the prize.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to point out insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the night off very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, house inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only night-time reserve in the land of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which welcomes eight of Scotland's ten night-time night-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-only-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-only-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
Here in Threave we have a very good area for nightlife, he said.
We have the old buildings, many old trees and all the good living.
But there is much more about the night-time snail that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what it needs to flourish.
It stresses the importance of night breaks being checked for maintenance on the properties as it is possible that the unintended destruction of a single motherhood village could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly destroying an entire local population.
Night owls are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Night-time Frog Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: 'We still have a lot to learn about our night owls and for many of our species we still don't know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers ready to search for a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has pointed to claims of rape against him as fake news, saying that people should promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are expected to seek the court's opinion of the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that she had paid $375,000 that day to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram Live with his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, pointed to the reports as fake news.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, said the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times while looking into the camera.
They must promote themselves by using names.
It's normal.
They have to be famous to say names, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going well, the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player seeks compensation for moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a disco, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by the anus, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his lap after the alleged incident and told her that he was 99% very disappointed with the 1%.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt relieved by the rhetoric and was concerned that she would be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reverse the solution as she is still being traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had joined Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer joined Italian football legend Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will regret it forever if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was of concern that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production cease-fires at our factory, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is related to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on an exact-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production is stopped.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.
"We need a deal. We need the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success to be enjoyed in the present but that we miss this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
The evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what was a very successful set of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convener at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the battle for supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is taking over the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's aid and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, instigates Washington's cry for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he was resigning.
Instead, she announced a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, which was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not hang Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid disappointment with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh over a period of a week, which led to a further full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: 'A date has not yet been set for it, it may be this week, and it may be next week because of all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But now I see and I always love keeping the picture updated.
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists who try to attract and influence the audience, although she said: "I do agree with the fact that they try to attract and influence the audience.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president holds more Q&A sessions than any previous president, she added without quoting any evidence:Look at those numbers.
The meetings will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to ask questions to the US president directly, it's better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot and we've seen it done a lot in the last few weeks and this will take the place of the press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump rarely answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves calmly and sometimes strangely in front of groups of journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-related fears
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and desire to remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of definite status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also increasing its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the workings of the health service, and they are beneficial to patients and the communities they serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and I wish you very much to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie performs emergency surgery after suffering an injury in Russia
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
'He went over the side line and like fell there,' said Reed.
Training and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before placing him on a stretcher and took him up on the back for further examination.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are currently no details on the type/extend of the injury and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year suspended college student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday he had five tackles before leaving the game, which led to a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more on the estate tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged more on the estate tax when buying property in the UK with the extra money used to accommodate the homeless under new Tory plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the flat-rate tax will be levied on non-payers of tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects this to rise to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher rate of flat tax when buying property in the UK - with the extra money being used to help homeless people.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and target high-wage earners.
The increase in the slumber tax will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay a tax in the UK, with the excess money boosting the Government's efforts to combat street sleep.
The additional charge - which is additional to the current flat tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - can be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which are raising prices and thus making it more difficult for new buyers to take the first step in the stages of buying accommodation.
Many of the country's rich areas - particularly in the capital city - have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers spending much of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the poll tax so more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the large construction firms of keeping property prices high by seizing land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to give us quotas on affordable housing to remedy the housing shyness situation in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of striking housing reforms proposed, including rental controls and an end to evictions without any harm.
He must also give the councils great powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said I would dedicate my office to re-creating the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The United Kingdom will always remain open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not fair that individuals not living in the UK, as well as foreign companies, find it as easy to buy houses as declining UK residents.
For many people the dream of having a home has become too distant, and the dignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real.
Jack Ross: My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says his fundamental ambition is to one day become Scotland's manager.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is facing the challenge of re-establishing the Grimaldi club, which currently sits third in League One, three points clear of the first-placed side.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I want to play for countries as a player.
I got B cap and nothing else, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But as a child I often went to see my father play Scotland at Hampden, and it has always been that thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity only comes if we succeed in managing a club.
Those who have come before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not concerned about the fact that he would follow such established names at such a large club, having previously rejected the offer from the City of Barnsley and Ipswich.
For now, will my success be based on can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
Given the structure and facilities of this club there is no doubt that this club belongs to the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I probably think I've only made it here if I can get the club back there.
Ross has spent just three years in his career as manager, following a stint as assistant head coach at Dumbledore and spending 15 months with the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third category, and transformed St Mirren from relegation leader to championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says they are now feeling more comfortable than they did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As for when he took Alloa in his arms, he recalls that this was probably a big change.
I generally thought that the manager's job was the most suitable one for me, far more so than that of a player.
It may sound strange because I was well-off, lived a decent life, and enjoyed some reasonable gains.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through each week.
I still experience this in terms of the stress and pressure of work but I simply feel that the job of manager is right for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do, and I feel like my whole adult life I'm feeling most comfortable now.

A survey finds that the best time to drink beer is at 5.30pm on evening
The summer heat wave boosted the profits of the UK pubs in difficulty but put further pressure on the restaurants of the same company.
In July, pubs and bars groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA for business consultancy, who collected the figures, said: 'Continuous heat and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were left even further.
The 1.8 per cent decline in restaurant sales in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars whose main sales are drinks were the most successful in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while restaurant sales decreased.
Pubs whose main sales are food have also suffered from the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to go out and drink.
In pubs and bars managed, sales of beverages increased by6.6 per cent per month, while food fell to three per cent.
Paul Newman, one of the entertainment and hospitality analysts at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors in terms of take-aways market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to find it difficult, although a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year on year will be particularly burdensome in addition to the pressures of ongoing costs.
The hot, long summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main sales are food and only time can give us advice on whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide much needed rest.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new business opening, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the pace of new business opening.

One in five children have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the foloz pages of Insta
The news has great fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a primary account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating adult-hiding social media accounts.
A survey of  20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in Instagram's follow accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has great fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a main account presentable to show to their parents, while having others private.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a young woman who was encouraging others to rape her - stupor me.
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom admit to holding private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many young people are looking to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated non-racing athlete and President Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sport leaders to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from joining the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope to be able to make a real contribution and help lead the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold medals and who is now a regular BBC critic, stopped walking after suffering a minor stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: As of this month, you're giving me a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that only time can tell if I am recovering or not or to what extent.
It was a hard job but I fully recovered, learned to sleep again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Breast pump advertising that matches mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has given rise to different opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered to be the world's first wearable breast pump that does not cause any noise, consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers are seen in a mural filled with cow's milk with a record containing lyrics such as: "Yes, I am a self-taught but sinless woman and in case I didn't know they are not cats but cats".
The chorus continues: Pumps out, pumps out, I'm feeding my babies, pumps out, pumps out, I'm defeating my wives.
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it sheds light on the terrors of the dairy industry.
Someone wrote There was a very bad decision that cows were used to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to catch and breed in order to produce milk, except that their babies are delivered within a few days of birth.

Another commented: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?
Another added: "Real-life advertising is really cut off.
Others defended the advertisement, with a woman admitting that she found the disc very amusing.
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I had a fourth I would buy one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is somewhat or too gardened but I got it from him.
This is a brilliant product, someone wrote.
Someone else commented: This is a fun ad aimed at pumped-up moms (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feeling like baqar.
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were all smoking with the non-reflective pumps placed in their arms.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their lungs say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump, which makes no noise, has no wires or tubes and sits in the breastplate without giving in to the eye, thus giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women using breast pumps to milk cows we wanted to draw attention to breast pumps and all the challenges they bring, while showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has appeared on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Homeless Migrant Children to a Tinda Camp at the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply despite the monthly border crossing being relatively unchanged, partly because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration made it harder for children to be placed with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were self-documented immigrants, and feared that if they presented themselves to take care of a child they would jeopardize their own ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their dog would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Nearly 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors' household are here in the country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to look for these individuals, said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the process involving children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the selters' workers.
Many will appear via a video conference call, rather than in person, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those considered ineligible for aid will be immediately deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or distressed, which can lead to violent expression or attempted escape.
Lawyers said that this concern is increased in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulty are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the city of the dead without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without telling their peers about their health can lead to trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria tells the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and were being addressed appropriately.
They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he told the assembly.
Moualem insists that the war on terrorism has almost come to an end in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died, with millions more displaced.
He said Damascus will continue this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cut off from both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
As regards the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fears that led the refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the latest strong major rebellion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoids a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed hope that the military action would target militants including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who are about to be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to the revision of the current constitutional articles, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win re-election provided that, as many liberal viewers expect, the denunciation and scandal finish his presidency ahead of time.
What will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale ever in a presidency!
Now, it seems that the viewers are still awake.
Since 2014, the time ratings with the largest number of viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers per hour with the highest number of viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" increased cable television ratings by as much as 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
"This is a situation that is drawing people to it because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's drama program "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She recalls a tax brawl in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, 'Why are you holding me,' Mrs. Scovell told me.
In this chaos there is a value of fun.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the headlines of stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the strength of the global economy.
Ignoring what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when on the site you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of deep-rooted sourcing for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's bombshell leather jacket (a dress that reflects pride, The Washington Post said) worth $15,000 and the implications of Stormy Daniel's descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy makeup.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it sound like a reality show is that every night you get something", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and the daily plot development of the Trump program (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you're going to fall back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home the weather was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
I remember when we used to do those eccentric programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a scam, but they were right.

Large amounts of money coming from abroad to the most tightly held elections to the White House's half term
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17 congressional districts are seeing a large amount of money, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that acquired two operators in a row for the same seat.
This recently re-established the pits of the suburban district of Pittsburg for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running as a candidate against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which extends far beyond the new 17th district.
The maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally voted in favor of the Republicans.
The creation of the new 17 districts has resulted in a difficult financial campaign contest between the main party's finance armaments, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in the much-sought March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then decided not to do so
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little assistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a brief meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some associates ran afoul of the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to reconnect with the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only applied to El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid, including drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions targeted, would be a burden on the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings began to progress, North and Central American officials have put on a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was strongly criticized for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration puts on the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were supported by a foreign analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study of the History
The next unexpected negative event may be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr Trump's possible disruption of justice, which is now very substantially documented in the public record.
It is reported that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign was agreed with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event that Congress passes to another person, Mr. Trump will find himself responsible in that body, as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainty, and I have no intention of suggesting that Mr Trump's execution is inevitable - nor that of his European counterparts.
There are choices to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, who had been resisted by the West and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the inexhaustible course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Today Americans face many of these inflationary points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculate that he is unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times' report was inaccurate.
How will we respond if the FBI's newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual conduct and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, in the middle of the term will we vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take a long time for a movement in democracy to take place.
But I believe I will not fail, given the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadors' home.
She managed to survive, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, on the day of worship, God sent me to light the candles on that table with a swastika.
With such a statement, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic before the competitive game with Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians, following their impressive match-up in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Europa League Group G.
An injury in the back prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season made the result equal of 2-2 with Villarreal but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for big things.
"This was a good point for us as Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We entered the game believing we could achieve something and we came out at a point.
We were probably able to win it to the end but, all in all, a fair result was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will once again be a great European night.
We hope we can score three points but it will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I think we can keep doing our best and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, amid all the injuries I have suffered and the changes at the club itself, but despite this there is now a sense of positivity.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is going well.
I hope that now we can do our best, forget the last season and succeed.
Women are worried about this fear related to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be inducted, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the  Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talk to their children about it.
People want to be a family member to cheer them up, but they are not taking the steps to make a conversation, said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business at Nationwide.
You should start like that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for providing care if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive treatment, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-insure with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents in the long run: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to select a reliable individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a financial proxy.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It's not just the finance involved, but who are the doctors? Martin said.
What are medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See that the plan is ready.
A man was shot several times by a helicopter in Fracombe
A man was hit several times by aerial gunfire as he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, who is over forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of IIfracombe, Devon, when he was struck by a gunshot wound to the abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "coincidental act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with deaths expected to rise.
With communication lines damaged, aid officials could not obtain any information from the Donggala region, which is an area in northern Palu that is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Pallu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
These are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, about the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the West coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of around 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck the city, it was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a region extending over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had a population of around 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is most concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the West coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Ta Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, which triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast with great force, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, which triggered a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low earthquake struck the ridge of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people recall the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was recorded, but over 100 were killed by a collapsed building.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the upper part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest child Arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when female acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, the KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself certainly, not guilty when asked to give his reason, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, which interfered with the domestic violence offence report, and that he had a gun in his possession while a minor in connection with the incident.
His girl alleged that her punch hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups after comparing her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5 and caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi in the Greater Grigal area of Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta.
Media are circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the city with heavy rain.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the NYC terrorist attack suspect to be given a rare death sentence
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, be given the death penalty - a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a road-to-bikes attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, by attacking pedestrians and cyclists who strolled along his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally murdered the eight victims and intentionally caused serious physical harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of the defendant carry with them a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury awarded Saipov 22 counts which included eight counts of murder with the aid of an organized riot, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Describing the way Saipov carried out this brutal, brutal and immoral attack, prosecutors said the attack required substantial planning and meditation.
The notice of intent states that Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last saw you face a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal New York case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being found guilty of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he inspired himself to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the prosecutor's chief.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were certainly disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to call for the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defence team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MEP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to immobilize the people's army.
The former head of the EU said politicians felt pressured by the Euroset - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for the EU negotiations.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK would have come out if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her highly divided positions has been stressed by pro-Brexit Tories joining a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers' compromise plan on track amid the attacks by Brexiters, anti-Brexiters and the EU.
The allies insisted that despite the negative reaction it would continue to move forward to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - and force the Euroxeticians and the Labour party to choose between its package and the Kaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Sollihull that he wanted to dismiss the Chequers plan.
It suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were responsible, we would be out now,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: 'I will defend Brexit but we need to reject Chequers' plan.
When he declared his anti-EU views, he said: 'We did not create world wars to be serfs.
We need to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their understanding and want to stay is absolutely not true.
Andrea Jenkyns, Brexit leader of the Tory Party, was also present at the demonstration, where she told reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, not popular with our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who vote for us first.
Please check the plan of  Chequers and start the list.
In a message to Mrs May, she said: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should feel under pressure that they would back down from the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They are trying to get back from Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you down if you do
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: "I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of going backwards from Brexit.
We are mobilizing in Brexit the people's army of this country that has made us successful and will not waste until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the launch of the group this weekend, a small number of activists spread banners with the words Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis who holds a high social position in the Labour party has called on the Conservatives to address security issues that have affected the party since the conference opened.
These are the people who tell us that we can have all the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada and beyond, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,he added.
This is a complete hoax.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren intends to thoroughly examine the possibility of running for the presidential election
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections she will carefully examine the possibility of running for the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Massachusetts Democratic Party member spoke about her future in a municipal-level debate with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the format of a debate with citizens at municipal level since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked her if she had any intention of running for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to build our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrested in connection with the shooting death of Sims of the LSU
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge, La., police announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
On Friday they released a shooting video, asking for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed in a building near the University of the South campus on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Wayde Sims suffered a head injury caused by a gunshot wound and eventually died as a result 
He came to defend his partner and was attacked by Simpson.
Simpson questioned him and admitted that he was on the scene, that he had a gun, and admitted to shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a six-foot-tall, Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches to win the world title after his team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
On Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important part in the race.
From the position on the inside in the first lap, Bottas had a good lead and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stop-zones and left Hamilton with the others in last place in the group, which was to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the stop zone after another lap and came out just after Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a few wheel-to-wheel action which caused the Ferrari driver to difficulty leave the inside free due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh place by the end of the first round in a snow-clap at the age of 21.
He then was ahead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of finishing fast and leaping Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually he entered the stop zone in lap 44 but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen came in fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his job very well all weekend and he was a real gentleman and said let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job of getting first and second place, said Hamilton.
That Was Really Bad Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump summoned Senator Dianne Feinstein to a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not expose the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were vile and disgusting and not sincere.
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on these last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and not sincere", he said.
When you look at statements and disclosures and then they say no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you find any information?
Remember her answer... I found the document - e, e, what is it?
You won't see.
I didn't find anything.
Look, wait a minute.
He said, "We're not going to get a chance to do anything".
Feinstein sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was uncovered earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the disclosure came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't find out her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.
But her denial seems to have been not well received by the president, who during the Saturday evening rally commented: "I know, that was a really bad physical attitude.
It may not have been a good experience, but it's the worst physical attitude I've ever seen.
While continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to recover power by any means necessary.
They see the violence, the disgust, they don't care who hurts, who makes the wheels go down to get the power and control, the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
The following are the squads for the UEFA Champions League:
Patrick Dwyer dark twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars suffered the Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match against the same opponent 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained a two-goal lead early in the game with two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored the same for the team playing in their home country before Dwyer regained an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the same score for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their win.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who after several losses advanced to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams have met, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford taking the step while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a period of intense action, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed Cownie at 15:16 which scored the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensures the Giants gain an advantage until the first break of the game when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reunited and again with Bouchard's help they beat the other team with a strong goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-ever game advantage at the end of the second period and ensure the fifth goal win for his side mid-final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died to Ensure Hundreds of People on Plane Could Escape From the Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were lost after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered a tsunami.
Strong forces continued to rule the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to rescue him, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was climbing at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was at the time on the runway, could safely depart.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was sliding.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palos.
"When we hear about this, I feel great pain", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
It is estimated that the number is still increasing as many bodies were still under scrap while many could not be reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres [60 ft] swept through Paul's Sunday mass dune.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance was bringing the body in.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being eroded everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can go for the worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia airplane accident: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, she could not give details on where one male passenger was located.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats helped to rescue the passengers and other crew members after the aircraft hit the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said that the Irish plane landed in the lagoon a few kilometres from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed too low.
'This is a really good thing,' Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the high water to the emergency exit on the burning plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and panicking, and that he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that seafarers working nearby to improve the pier also helped in the rescue by using a paddle boat to carry passengers to shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents registered with PNG but no accident involved Air Niugini.
Analyst presents a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for full hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to gather together information about the movements of the defendant, Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he had received localization data from several mobiles that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night he died, contradicting his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the mobile data showed that he was with Chambers at the time in which he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, since my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile.
'He erased her from his life,' said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the genre's negative perspective by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argue that hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY called you a couple who broke up after a message racism
Nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from her mother who was complaining that she was another black person.
The couple deny being racist, and compare the case to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed regret when it was learned that the new child-director, Giselle Maurice, was in a dark carnival on her first day at work in 2016.
"Another black person", wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After being found guilty of her gross mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt a sense of urgency and kicked out Ms. Maurice, where she said that her former nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was instead waiting for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice was called for one day's work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is training the couple for compensation in respect of the dismissal, and is asking for compensation of $350 per day for the  six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do things like that, she told the Post, adding that I know this is discrimination.
The couple attacked racist claims, saying that the firing of Ms Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing that they could not trust her after offending her.
Martha sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told Post.
But what if you entrusted your children to someone who spoke to them in a callous way, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby at birth?
And let's see.
When comparing the case with the presentation, Plasco said that only two months had passed since his wife had the baby and she was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to accuse someone like that?
It is not a nice thing to do, added the investment banker.
While the legal case was still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly notified the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's really fun the fact that we now know what we know about Paddington's great success.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book from a small toy bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "pleasant but somewhat saddened" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as a very important member of our family, she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never spoke about it.
'He was quite a quiet man, and he was not full of breath,' she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child get something: be proud of them even if it's not you who got something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to give her the last phone call
On landing her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but it was all in vain.
He was calling me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that he was not expected to live, said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a phone call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to give her one last kiss.
And I did.
Tell her, Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctor gave her to keep her heart beating were decreasing and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a little earlier and started to break everything.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not cry or be hurt or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it back.
Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was weeping for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
No one knew, she said.
I was shaken, and tears began to flow all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a great sense of sympathy towards Nad.
That he needed my love and that we were told.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards of distressed women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.
However, he had to quit work before he died, as he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: 'I am always afraid that this will be the cause of another violent event.
Ms Davis created the cards, so that you can let people know that there are people you can open your heart to or meet, even as a friend.
Do not be silent - you need to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, not long after the death of his mother.
"He wasn't saying he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day was very bad - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make any eye contact with them or anything like that.
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to repair it: Leave a void in the family.
It'll free us.
But we all have to go on living and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in a precarious situation as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I said, that if we could get something like what he asked for - a time-limited, purpose-limited investigation - we might have brought some unity", said Mr Flake the Sabbath, adding that he feared the committee was being carried away by paralyzed partisans who had taken root.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is due entirely to the choice of time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will severely weaken their attempts to place the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was taking the phone to call the Senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently hold office.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm her for the Supreme Court.
The number of deserts in South Korea is declining under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Citing data from the Ministry for the Unification of the Southern Region, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1,127 party changes last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of deserters from the North Sea are actually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them flee by passing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to share compared to the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by force.
Relations between the North and South Poles - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stage of denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on general terms to work towards the Korean Peninsula free from nuclear danger.
But on Saturday, Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imposed US sanctions for the lack of progress made since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will in no way be the first to unilaterally disarm", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he is unable to work at the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Mr Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because of his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever had to behave like that, they would say hysterically", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes even shouting and warming up when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a grotesque and coordinated character assassination organized by liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court, because it showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's qualifying himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi spoke when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say something -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not capable, not only of being in the Supreme Court, but even of being in the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is seen as conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoids questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not a place for a person with hysterical prejudices to go to court and wait for me to say, 'Very well,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority.
It is a just verbal attack, months and years filled with anger, and she cannot say what she has to say without crying.
"We cry when we cry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is rare, do you?
She added, "I was very sorry to hear a woman who was trapped somewhere else, who said that she too would cry when raped, but a technique developed that meant that when she raced and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You probably think she was sad because she was crying".
I'm overwhelmed.
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought it was something brilliant.
Crying is permitted as a way to express his great anger in part because it is fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with indescribable rage, was when an older woman caught me by the throat of a necklace - a bed manager I had always been a little afraid of - and ran me down the stairs.
Never let them see you cry, you said.
They don't know you're overweight.
They think you are sad and they are happy that they managed to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat known as Monkey Business and dropped out of the election, Mrs Schroeder, very much worried, concluded that there was no reason why she had not explored the idea of running herself for the presidential election.
"This was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates who were going to run for office, and the last thing he wanted was another candidate.
Someone calls her Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since this was the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, so she vowed not to run for election unless she made $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her fans who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
Do they think I'm getting a discount? she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - grateful to the people who supported her, overwhelmed by the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and overwhelmed by sexism - that she was devastated.
I probably thought I had these strong breaks, Mrs Schroeder recalled the way the media reacted to her.
I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what do they write on my grave?
Is she crying?
How the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The numbers of the opening airstrikes of the US-China trade war were staggering, and while the battle is still to be ended, a lack of agreement between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exporters including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly been annoyed in the same way, while more recently it was presenting tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to agree with the United States every time, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will collapse in the near future.
The fact that Washington is taking a step back means that it accepts the demands, but publicly the fact that China cedes to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing acts wisely, the pressures of the US trade war could support China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized by inspectors, said Abigail Grace, research partner focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which is a think tank.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries sponsoring the session.
Europe welcomes the Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European titles and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is a prominent US player, who has been struggling throughout the tournament, crashed his 16th hole in the water par-3, thus handing over his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to have ever gone 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, brought 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who played in his final Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European player to ever play in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
I normally don't cry but today I couldn't stop.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy to have the cup back.
The team is everything, and I'm glad I was able to help, Garcia said excited after the European victory.
He passes the torch to fellow compatriot John Ram who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 fsingles play on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel, that I beat Tiger Woods, when I was raised to follow him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3 throughout his career.
Strange statistic of one of the greatest players ever here, winning 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA spent the whole weekend finding those golfing parts of the course with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we felt some pressure on Europe.
We argued.
I'll send Thomas the hat.
He's a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 young men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat and cut your head off.
Love her better.
