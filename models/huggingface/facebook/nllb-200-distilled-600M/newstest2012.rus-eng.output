Parliament does not support the amendment that frees Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, while amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected the attempt to repeal the article condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the economic offence relief bill.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which condemned the former prime minister, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would take 226 votes to ratify.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert.
It's time to determine the winners.
Islamists usually win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the common law of Sharia, which we have already heard about.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the punishment for stealing is to cut off one's hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Quran.
Libya will be a place we cannot imagine and would not wish for.
Either way, our lifestyle is not unique, nor is it the best, and it probably wouldn't fit, for example, the Libyan population.
In fact, it's amazing that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only justification was that they believed the NATO raids were not led by an American general but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if we look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We've been in the riots, we've served Islam, and our politicians have gotten rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of gain.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about expelling the Crusaders.
But without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for almost nothing?
And the West will finally be able to boast of selfless civil rights.
Unless the Sharia people put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
The statistical storm swept through Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have released GDP figures for the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are now not only looking to Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical bureaus of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, when Germany was doing better than expected (up 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%).
In the third quarter of this year , the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, the GDP was stagnant in comparison to the previous quarter, which, according to the Czech Statistical Office, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a stagnant state compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy has shown a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the deteriorating situation in the region, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, they say the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech national team has qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully overcome the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jiraček, they won 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky enough to retain a significant lead after the home-and-away match, and it will once again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and good luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiracek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its entry into the European Championship.
The Czech team's excellent defense allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovich and Vucinich became the most unsuccessful pair of match after missing two great opportunities.
The great Petr Čech is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
The game was very tense from the first few minutes.
Both teams had difficulty making combinations; the game was mostly in the middle of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the hosts' team in the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around Iran's nuclear power plant.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Tuesday afternoon, students prayed for the destruction of both the United States and Israel before entering the building.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to defend their country's nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that everything indicates that Iran has not given up on nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
Tuesday afternoon, students prayed for the entrance to the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, and the US and Israel prayed for the death of Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran's nuclear program, the targets, according to the Israeli press, will be the uranium enrichment facilities in both Isfahan and Natanz.
Nutrition for children with obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to a recent study, children with obesity are usually born into families with unhealthy lifestyles.
We see again the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior that accompany a person for their healthy development.
For example, sausages are almost twice as common on the tables of children with obesity as in families with normal weight.
More than 19 percent of obese children ate potatoes for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity.
Moreover, families of children with obesity do not engage in sports, but this is true of most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted on 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year; it involved nearly 900 elementary school students throughout Bohemia.
The event Obesity is no accident, it was held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students of 4th-8th grade have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise are key determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who are either overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of those surveyed said they ate five meals a day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is a must", says one study.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings .
Experts warn that even relative details such as regular family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast together.
Most families have breakfast separately.
The worst finding was that one in ten families didn't eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
Research has shown that fried foods are more common in families with children who are obese.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet cooling drinks every day (70%).
While more than 40 percent of children are regularly involved in sports, that number is more than doubled - to 15 percent - when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of 12-15 year-olds in the Czech Republic are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating".
Their favorite food includes a large amount of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
"The popularity of soft drinks is particularly alarming", says the final part of the study.
As the main meal, pasta beat the bird with a small weight.
However, the children were barely interested in bean, fish, and vegetable dishes.
The Pursuit of a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits provided they are given the right information.
"Many study controls showed a significant shift in preference for healthy eating when they completed the questionnaire after the lecture", the project concludes.
This was especially evident, for example, in the case of sweet, cool drinks - more children were starting to prefer them to just water.
In addition, children were more likely to eat poultry and fish as a main course, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, professionals say.
In my first article on stylist training, I looked at the amount of information in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures from three experts in the field; advice on choosing clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how it all works in real life.
More later.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really filled with information.
This time, with the principal, Alenka, (there's not a single male on the course), we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One of them has a short neck, another boyish figure without the proper shape, another one weighs more than normal.
The stylist must know how to visually shrink the shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volumes.
They gave us advice on how to highlight the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have more bulky breasts and hips and a narrow waist, and not wear them too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between your waist and thigh is so great that you cannot pick up a skirt or trousers, you should have at least one item sewn to your specialty.
You're obviously not going to regret the investment, because perfectly seated clothes are priceless.
You'll feel much better in a custom-made skirt than one that's always moving around, folding, and unwrapping your waistline, and so on.
On the other hand, the owners of boy figures may wear clothes with a pattern, a pattern, a knitting pattern or a fold.
Given the abundance of information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to realize it.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each student had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We need to consider their modern appearance, their style of clothing and their type of figure.
I'm going to wear Miranda Kerr, who you can tell from Victoria's Secret commercials.
I'm glad I am, because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently recovered a ton (please note that I'm exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print them and process them with graphics.
The mudboard -- it's called the result of the work -- then reflects our own style and attitude toward the graphic image.
It's important to keep the graphic component of style in mind.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but also creates product pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the designer and stylist Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only Sunday.
A stylist needs a general knowledge
Saturday's lecture, filled with information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - experts in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pokorny; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Renz.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use that fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-trench can be worn in a normal fashion, over jeans and T-shirts, as a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without a tie, as a dress.
Another option is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole picture changes completely.
"Play with him", he insisted.
Anyway, the advice I really appreciated was this: "You have to know the rules perfectly for your job".
Then you can start breaking them", Jacob told us.
And here I finally understood why we're putting all the definitions and rules together, what to combine with and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
I learned from Ben, a photographer, that a stylist should have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion review of ten pages, I have to be willing to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that in a picture, the object of clothing often looks and works in combination with others quite differently than it does in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when creating an image.
Honza Pokorna has confirmed that often image and style are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a great vocal, but her image and marketing has made her a global star.
Attitudes towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic are still quite cool.
Even famous people often think it's superfluous (and believe that it's enough to be an expert in something, and how they look is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different size than the one they actually wear.
Then we go to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about a celebrity who's been losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that it wasn't enough for a stylist to know fashion and be able to pick out a dress.
Our job is basically to communicate with the people we dress for, so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to be compelled and to hold to your opinion.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible".
"Find at least a few things you can commend and suggest what you can bring with you", says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what the work bag should fit.
It's a bag you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious items such as scissors, sticky roller or English ties, it must have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting certain items, such as a bag or hat), special clips to attach fabric to the back in case the clothing is too large (shorts and similar items are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or a sewing set.
To distract us from the lecture and gain some practical experience, we learned how to properly make the shoes' soles.
Even when shooting in a studio where the floor is smooth, the floors can get damaged - not to mention on the street.
And we got the glue.
You shouldn't touch your shoes with scissors, or you'll ruin them.
It takes real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills I mentioned.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as they say.
V for Speed: Running takes place in America.
The review
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were met to some extent, but that didn't matter, because nobody wanted to do the overwork.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Fleeing" there were high hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the result is very different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade game, but the overall impression is ruined by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, it's not a mistake, but an expression of the inexplicable laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts off very well.
You become part of a story where the protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race across America.
You get in a car on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to be the first to get to New York.
There are some interesting features to this idea.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes its own route, with individual stages taking place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the graphics are on the same level as the previous installments in the series, some tracks are enjoyable to watch.
And yet the game doesn't cause any strong emotions.
Although it is a pleasure to drive through the desert, through the autumn suburbs, or high in the snowy mountains.
Besides, the race comes alive with an unusual detail every now and then.
For example, in the desert, you're hit by a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught in the avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
Some time you try to outrun several competitors (a normal race essentially); then you try to improve the time (a standard race with a second meter); or you compete against one opponent.
Besides, you sometimes run into the police, which makes your job even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack runs away from someone most of the time and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not that complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (just three to be exact).
It turns out that it's actually good for the game because it's not boring; considering all of the above, it's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
It means that it's no longer special, but it's not a disadvantage.
If you're looking for a real-life simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options available on the market.
It's all right.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model isn't that good.
You don't expect any complicated transformations and collisions from this game, but if you don't have a clue before you hit an object, how your car will behave, something's wrong.
Usually, when you're driving or passing cars in a tight flow, you sometimes touch another car slightly, and yet sometimes in a similar situation, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or the beads were broken.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you crash or get off the track, the game will take you back to the point where it broke.
Still, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use all of them, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to memorize a particular race track.
The important disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you'll encounter civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially irritating when you see your opponent easily moving between two cars moving in opposite directions, whereas when you're there, the cars are already positioned so you either need to go around them or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's all set up so that the situation is always right in front of you.
There are other advantages to competitors.
During the game, you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent is chasing you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand up to you no matter what.
The thing is, when he drives in front of you, he makes your vision worse, which leads to one or more accidents on that stretch.
You can understand trying to make the game more interesting and adrenaline-filled, but it's so obvious it's quickly becoming irritating.
It's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the game is so entertaining and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't make you miss -- a concept with 50 unique tracks, a racing sequence or something.
The idea of changing cars during a race is unusual.
You need to keep track of the gas stations along the way, because that's where your car can change, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars for straight roads; and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, such as on curved mountain tracks.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it's individual racing that you learn throughout the game.
Here you win medals for your personal business and points for the challenges and story modes.
There are many ways to get a higher level of driving: from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online feature, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides communication with the public.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; it's an example from the last race in a row.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (we'll assume that) where you're running on the tracks in the dark (we'll assume that).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we'll assume that) when suddenly a subway train comes up behind you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For days, our editorial team debated whether the game was actually created without anyone thinking for a second, or whether the creators really thought we were such idiots.
The technical aspect of the game is not that special; but the overall impression of the video game is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
It's a shame that at some critical moments, the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, declines.
This is especially true in high-stakes incidents where a good recording would not help you much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
To appeal to a wider audience of young people, the soundtrack included "compositions of different styles"; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: Running is pretty messy.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Running is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of incompleteness.
Of course, it's a good time, but be prepared for the shortcomings that will blind you like an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unwelcome and sceptical of the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreement between the various organizations".
"I didn't expect such a brutal war".
"It takes five or six years before the situation at least stabilizes, calms down and all the players get used to their new roles", EU ambassador Milena Vitsenova began her lecture at the law school.
She demonstrated how much she adhered to her motto "Clear and Open Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simply and understandably that many of the lecturers at UC Law would be envious.
Moreover, Vitsenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was just a gray office mouse who couldn't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he did his part".
"He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States at once, communicate with them well and has a clear idea of the direction in which the EU should be developed".
She explained her new position as the EU's representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?" that is, as an important step towards unifying and increasing transparency of EU policies towards countries like China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vitsenova further focused on a key EU programme in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success last year.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, the Czech representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the ongoing fallout.
It is also necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is not easy given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be given preference; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these issues are in the upcoming programme.
The ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "On Europe, in a clear language".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon that nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese.'
It also intends to use the EU environment more effectively and to attract more Czechs to European organisations.
High-speed Europe is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered euroskeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wants more Czech representatives involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary and we have a Slovak, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's the matter, the Visegrad group again?' and he's not happy about it.
In the future, the Union is expected to have new, strict rules for the budgetary policies of the participating states.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the Cooperation Institute".
"It was said for the first time that countries that wanted to unite should unite, while those that did not want to could stay out".
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe", Vitsenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed by all participating countries, not just those in the Eurozone.
The history of the brand:
IBM's innovator is entering its second century.
If anyone wants to find the word that best expresses IMB strategy, the closest one is probably "long term".
IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution for the general public; the company is considered very modern, even though it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was established by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many world problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the future giant's life unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson built up carefully.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means a steady move into the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, even though it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has transformed technology, business and the company.
In the next hundred years, we hope to achieve even more", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO, on the anniversary.
A complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care as Batya did in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
IBM's long-term consumer relationship is equally advanced.
From the very beginning, the company was a brilliant application to talented people, and it was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
It's consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan that a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmisano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the last few years, IBM has been organizing meetings, online brainstorming, where many future innovations are born.
No wonder there's so many ideas -- there's about half a million people in the company.
A good name organization
The company's strong position in business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the very beginning, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company", Harvard Business School professor and IBM author Rosabette Moss Kanter told Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps businesses solve business problems with technology", adds Forrester Research consultant Joe Colony.
As the company itself says, there's a difference between going into the market and creating it.
Over the course of a hundred years, IBM, or the "Blue Giant", as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company -- hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting -- from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, barcode, and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (first place behind Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all of its products were in the best interests of customers and fit the era.
"If your business is driven by moving forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM is easy to lay the foundation for multiple platforms -- if they don't work, it abandons them.
It's different from its competitor Microsoft, which is based on and experiencing a downturn in Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM's primary revenue comes from services, with about a fifth coming from computer programs and hardware.
In 1990, with a capital of twice that, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-income assets, while investing $58 billion in promising technology.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems IBM hasn't done any damage to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM's stock price has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net earnings have been steadily increasing.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
So we can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will handle the situation.
IBM history: from the cheese knife to spaceflight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago. Its original name was "Computing, Tabling, Record Corporation" which was quite complicated.
It was renamed IBM in 1924, and was originally used as a brand name for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation for IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1880s.
They had technology like the legendary "table clock", which records the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the CEO of his competitor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the CEO threw the IBM founder out of the picture - Watson's ideas remain the foundation of an unbreakable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, started with the production and sale of various equipment for business - from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson's tenure, revenues doubled to nine million dollars, and the company began a massive expansion to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took his place as director.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control spaceflights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defined computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computer manufacturing business to Lenovo, a Chinese company, and bought the consulting business PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus focusing entirely on high-value-added services and consulting.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is to make smart use of technology in areas where it hasn't been planned yet, and improve road conditions and urban governance.
In the business world, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps business people control the entire business cycle.
IBM's traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-class research group on speech recognition also operates.
Richterzhov about her unfaithful husband:
Iwata, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darien Richtarzova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Joseph Richterge (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Peppa can go home, but not as my partner anymore", explained Rihtarzova.
When Dariina Richterzova gave Bartoshova a roof over her house in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Eve to leave Rjican after 30 days, Peppa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted to loving her.
After a while, Darien gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
Richter doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richter and Bartoshev ever part, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out".
"But he will end his days not as my beloved lost and found old fool, but as someone with whom I have a connection", said Rihtarzova, adding that she has already broken up with her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has no objection to his wife's rejection.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to stay with Yvette, I'm not going to change that".
"My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision".
"Our union is still functioning; I'm in charge of repairs, gardens, houses and shopping".
"Darina and I are communicating perfectly well, except we don't share a bed anymore", Richter told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richterzov finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a boyfriend with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Eve and I'm fully responsible", Joseph concluded.
Worst Habits of Women: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to list some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines describing some of the female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains you're always shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping at the big sale?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping habits.
Yet, who among you would refuse to walk around the clothing store looking for the perfect fit and try it out (preferably in different colors) in the sample?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but it can be hell for men.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside...
The Everlasting Discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Do you still like me?"
Do you know these phrases?
- You did?
Then you're in a group of women who are mixed up in their looks.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to their partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent these complaints are, the more women annoy them.
Order and cleanliness are the most important
It's like an endless story.
Washing glass, dust cleaner, floor washing, dust wiping, bathroom cleaning - at least twice a week.
You criticize your partner for stepping on a clean coffee shop in dirty shoes; for kids stepping on dirt in a clean sink and for fingerprints on a living room window that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this "depravity", try to realize that it is not good to be extreme; and that order and cleanliness should not be your first priority in your family.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship and the whole family.
The Pursuit of Commanding
"Throw your clothes in the basket".
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels should not lie on the floor".
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
I 'm not a gossip .
Some women like to gossip, insult, and plot against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how, and why.
I guess we all gossip from time to time.
Let's face it, that's the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossipsters, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working class, pose a greater danger to their environment.
The results of the Jagr and the Voratchek helped Philadelphia win .
During the NHL game on Monday, two successful moves by hockey forward Yaromir Jagr helped Philadelphia beat Carolina 5:3 on ice.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player of the match.
Two of the match's results also belonged to the same team player with Yagor Yakubu Vorachec.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he predicted a great evening for Gira.
"I told him before the game that he'd score a hat trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you feel things like that", explained Jagr, after which he scored a goal on the first opportunity the Flyers gave him.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech footprint".
The Hurricanes' closing pitcher, Vorak, took the pitch and gave it to Max Talbot, who scored between the innings.
A second before the first break, home run Patrick Dwyer narrowed the lead to a numerical lead, but the Flyers led again early in the second half.
Especially Giro.
After the successful delivery of the Jagr, he scored the third goal; later his strike was converted into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said, praising his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing hockey with a player like him".
"It makes me happy".
"I want to support him".
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now it's my turn", Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Root and Dwyer's penalty kick, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area".
"He hit the hook, I accelerated, and Reed went over to the far end".
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked", Voráček described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The win moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not finish the game against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Along with the experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 2:3 after the penalty shoot-out.
Thomas the Blowman failed to score during one of their attacks.
More than the points lost, the home coach was upset by the number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
"It's not good".
"We finished the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people".
"We can't do anything about it anyway, we just have to accept it", said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement by replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist".
"We had to make the game easier, move the chip out of our zone".
"What was our weak side", added defender P.K. Subban
After 30 attacks, Czech goalkeeper Ongje Pavelets helped Winnipeg beat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted a five-game losing streak, were scored by five different players.
The dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourism agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, tourist agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, for the holidays, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balatón).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on Czech tourists' travel to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually through socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel on his own, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was required; otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered travel to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" at the agency.
And that's not all.
A currency permit was required to travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West.
Most often the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, a practice that continues to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus experienced a real revolution.
While before 1989, holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The big paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989, we couldn't freely visit the most popular country in Croatia today, because it was part of former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the need for visas to visit neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, and a huge wave of short trips began, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechs could not get enough of traveling west.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in tents in parks because their income at the time was insufficient to afford a hotel or boarding house.
The typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring in their own food (consequences, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which, decades later, allows tourists to buy Western currency freely.
Our living standards and average income were rising, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines, and now, compared to the past, flights have become incredibly cheap thanks to the ability to order wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed countries except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Today, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, happened in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, and our country has become one of the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history, in 2008, Czechs spent more than half their vacation abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15 thousand crowns per person during their vacation abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The General Assembly must elect the president, the threat of the Pat returns.
For about five months, Czech football has had no president, and there is a risk that Ivan Gashek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There's still no consensus on what election rules to follow.
Without that, the vote on one of the three candidates won't start.
Yindhrych Reichl, Miroslav Pelt and Tomáš Paclik are eager to lead the Czech football.
Gashek left his post in June, and as he left, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong figure who would lead football in the future.
However, the Gashek era again plunged football into a dispute between two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became apparent on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly have come to the National House in Prague, Smykhov, in vain, because the negotiations have remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
No agreement was reached on who was entitled to vote in the general meeting - only the legal representatives or the officials who were given powers.
This point has since been partially settled by a recommendation from the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on delegated powers is impossible.
Disputes over election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board has also not helped much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is largely concerned with this issue.
The way we vote has changed a few times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is, how do you get to the third round and avoid the pat?
"The challenge is whether to follow the established norms or find another model", says one of the vice-presidents of FAČR Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model provided for in the charter, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received the most support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agrees to a compromise - to consider the candidate with the most votes in both chambers the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists that the winner must get at least two thirds of the votes in the overall percentage.
"However, the previous two rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the two-chamber concept", Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments.
Somehow, Tomasz Paclyk suddenly agrees with his opinion, although according to the election rules set out in the constitution, Pelto is more pleased than other candidates.
"I would like the election to be as constitutional as possible".
"I want to avoid any representative stupidity like the previous general meeting", says Victoria Plzen, the owner of the first-time candidate; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelt.
Peltha is still optimistic.
He believes the new president will become known in Nimburk; he also hopes that in the future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All the emotional rush will calm down after today's anticipated European Championship withdrawal".
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate", says a Jablonec representative.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope there's a deal, but the situation is very ambiguous".
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules".
"It could cause another disruption to the general assembly".
"I hope common sense wins", said Reichl.
There's not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to take, among others, Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgoritsa, failed to leave Prague this morning due to a technical malfunction.
After all, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, could be decisive.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Youssef Dobesh, would like the opposition parties to come to an agreement as part of the country's strongest sports association.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football's creditworthiness; and a planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech sports directorate after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclyk enters the presidential race because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football team, Plzen Tomáš Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who would have met all his requirements for the presidency of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) before the extraordinary general meeting, he would not even have been a candidate for a high position.
"If I had a decent candidate, I would have fought for him and not fought myself".
"But such a person has not yet been found", said Paclik ČTK.
Paclyk's motive for entering the fight against Miroslav Pelt and Yindhrid Reichl was to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged election favorite, from entering the FAČR.
Moreover, Paclyk emphasizes that in the event of victory, he will remain president until 2013, when another general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see an experienced top manager take the job, not too involved in football.
"I've spoken to a few people you might think of".
"It was horrible to hear some of them say that at this moment they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football".
"I'd like to change that opinion", he said.
Currently, Paclyk's main disagreement with Peltha is his relationship with Roman Berbrom, president of the regional football association in Plzen.
Paclyk thus considers it unacceptable that Peltas become president.
"If he wins, the situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward".
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football", said Paclyk.
He hinted at the fact that a few years ago, Pelt's name was recorded during a phone tap during a corruption investigation; Pelt managed to avoid the verdict.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclyk. He now does not mention his previous statement that he would "sell the Plesen club if Pelt became president".
If Paclyk wins Thursday, he could be working with Pelt in the future.
That's the view of another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclyk supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Peltha) would be the first one I would turn to".
'He's very capable.'
"I can imagine him leading the team".
"But he can't run the association".
"I don't suck my nose into what I don't understand either", said Paclyk, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judges' brigade led by Ludek Macelova, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Paclyk claims he's risking running the association.
He cites his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has been managing the Plzen team, which with his help celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"I have the power to change the football environment, to support its change for the better".
"Remove the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals council, which leads to disgusting situations", said Paclyk.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money for sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points the new president has to deal with".
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they should clearly state where the money will go", he said.
Paclyk does not consider his connection to the Plzen club a burden, although he claims that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Peltha is connected to Jablonez, and Reichl to the Prague Dukedom.
"It's not the perfect option".
"I still don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares of the Plzen club to someone else, since I'm going back there in six months", says Paclyk.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that will avoid the Election Path
Two days before the football association's general meeting, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Peltha, promised that if elected, he would fight for new FAČR rules to avoid future disputes over election rules.
Until Thursday's talks in Nimburk, the Jablonec functionary remains optimistic and believes that the focus on the campaign will be significantly diverted from the expected success of our football team today.
Before the failed election in September, Pelt promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and receiving funding.
He decided to run for election at the last minute before the last general meeting, so a two-month delay could have been useful to him in defending his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday".
"They feel that now is the time for someone to head the association", says a man mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules, which were not as perfect as we all thought, were adopted at the general meeting in June".
"If different ways of representing the people had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September", Peltha said.
He referred to the rewrite of the key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal responsibility, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt fails".
"It's a fundamental question that we can't live without", Peltas says.
Besides, he says he's not trying to stand out from the crowd.
He has previously stated that he can present his collaboration with Yindhrid Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Pacelik, who was a constant critic of Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and he's had some success".
"In any case, his attacks were indecent and many people were surprised by the methods of his campaign".
"Some of them are still questioning his true identity", Peltas said of his rival, who claims to be true to the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from the lowest level of competition to the national team.
The national team should represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, beginning with the Bohemian affair or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football", the forty-six-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election as football head would not result in staff firings.
"I'll need to know the job instructions of individual employees". That was his message to Strachow, where the prolonged period of intergovernmental power causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the disastrous scenarios that accompany the planned general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not come to Nimburg for nothing on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to run in the third round, we can handle it".
"Football needs the confidence it can gain only by finally choosing its leader", says Peltha, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career as a manager.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, FAČR will start to work actively
If at Thursday's meeting, the current vice president, Yindrich Reichl, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the association, rumor has it, will be unhappy.
Reichl promises that if he gets elected, it's going to be a hard time.
He wants to change the system and make the executive committee members responsible for certain areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of former president Ivan Gashek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football in general".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national teams, professional football and youth football events".
"I don't mean to say that I'll do it all myself", Reichl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute the powers of the executive committee so that each member is focused on a specific area".
"I'm going to sort the tasks out so that in each of these segments, football makes big strides".
"It's probably not going to be a good idea for many people because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticism of other people's work", he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"Because I know I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know if it makes sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who stick sticks in my wheels and question my every move", he explained.
"However, many people have told me not to give up or others will come".
"It's a trust I can't throw away", he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to override it".
"There have been processes that could yield results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them", he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Peltha, is elected, the situation in the Association may return to what it was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelt is unlikely to be competent in".
"He's surrounded by people who would play football so that it's only available to the select few".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for subjectivity".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to make football accessible to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority", said Reichl.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will only be president of the Czech Republic.
"While many people try to say otherwise, I plan to do the best I can for Moravia".
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian divisions, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league".
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", said Reichl.
While the Plzen club's manager Tomasz Paclik entered the presidential race, Reichl dares not assess his chances of winning.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech House, which elected me its vice president, and I see that I have made some obvious progress", Reichl said.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelt was "excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclyk, a strong candidate who has much to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job at Plzen this year".
"If elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started without significant personnel changes in the committees".
"He would not distort the facts for his own benefit", Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump in the water.
Julia Stanek
Children's swimming pools with universal fiber optics and stately pools in Budapest, where travelers can experience Europe's incredible water - and relax a tired body in a jacuzzi after a city tour or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
There's one thing Iris Meader couldn't do without during her exploratory trips the last year and a half: her swimsuit.
She lay on her back in the water, looking up at the tastefully decorated domes, swimming to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admiring the carefully restored ar-nuvo swimming pools.
She was quick to add every swimming pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
Architectural historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools - and now collects impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming), which includes everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in the Town.
Her "journey to the most unusual bathrooms in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and to other cities in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, and Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true swimming culture enthusiast.
She has little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in water, it's different.
The only drawback is that swimming enthusiasts must tolerate the blue brown tile and chlorine smell, while runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful birdsongs in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools always have to be so horrible", says Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools".
When the surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the pool and refined oils in the sauna are such a health factor in swimming pools because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real eye-pleaser if the builders take on this kind of work.
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building".
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The 190-page illustrated edition of "The Joy of Swimming" provides valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump in the water.
The collector of the Meder reservoirs discovered several outstanding specimens during his research in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Micholz-Tapolz) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasperne), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as the 100-year-old Seceni baths in Budapest.
On the other hand, there are many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, and you can see the whole of Zurich from the bathroom on the roof, or you can see the snow-covered Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anton, and there's a steam window that lets you see what's going on on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld, the Aquatic Cathedral in Etchtal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a steam of three open shells rises from the lake, which appears quite small against the backdrop of the Estonian mountains.
Alhambra in the Swartzwald
Meder, a pool collector, did not find chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell gray, and the Arpad baths in Becheshchab smell so badly of oil that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a healing spring.
The smell of hydrocarbons in alkaline water is almost black from the mud that sticks to the skin once you dive in a pool, a healing experience of a certain kind.
Iris Meder, however, at one point was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open-air Czech swimming pool in Lugatchovice, she discovered that the area was sealed.
The baths designed by architect Dusan Yurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked through the red-and-white-yellow windows of the Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by the hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in the Swartzwald - the Palace of Thermal Waters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already been built in three stages, and you'll find not only neo-Romanesque elements from the period after 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of the pool expert Iris Meder, and not only because she is from Swarzwald.
"It's a real achievement to masterfully combine such different architectural styles", says Meder.
Diving in a thermal pool in a palace like this is obviously a secondary activity.
Speculation on agricultural products
The Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will the Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann has given the task force a task to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The CEO plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
According to one study, 84 percent of Germans feel that it is unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world's poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report's author, Harold Schumann, demonstrates that gambling on global commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus implicated in global hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed against the bank's CEO Joseph Akkermann, although major banking houses such as Goodman Sacks and Morgan Stanley are trading the same.
Initially, the idea of a commodity bet was to protect traders from price fluctuations.
Anyway, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand - and are making a living at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism, promising to investigate the charges and stating that no trade was "worth the risk of compromising the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The bank's head plans to announce the changes following the investigation in late January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The stakes on rising food prices are a stark example of how recklessly banks are now acting against the common interest".
As the chief lobbyist of the bank, Akkermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
"Doiche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices", said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's the starving people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but in the meantime, the director would like to have a perfect image just months before he ends his time in office.
The Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as planned.
The removal of the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also has little to worry about expenses - the consequences will be his successor.
Every second would refuse to invest in commodities.
Foodwatch is trying to keep the manager under pressure.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, and the study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and involved 1,001 people.
No more than 11 percent believe investments that bet on food prices are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take specific steps if they found their bank involved in such a trade, and according to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits that would eventually lead to commodity speculation.
43% would recommend leaving the bank, 49% said they'd consider closing their accounts and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion in a new location
Ingeborg Vinsovsky
The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was abandoned and abandoned.
It's now being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanser for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a famous example of modern postwar architecture with its simple shapes, glass halls, boldly expressing faith in technical progress.
The Schwansera Pavilion won the Grand Prix in architecture in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a landmark in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World's Fair.
It finally became world famous in 1973 with its legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister, the cup-shaped building.
The pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
Either way, the building was not suitable for a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks on, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been vacant since 2001, and its condition has been getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Kryshanitz has now restored the pavilion, which has been called the "21st Century House" and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday night - a joyful event in every sense.
Agnes Huslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Gallery in Austria in 2007, helped launch the new venture.
Huslyn-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and conservators to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and made a decision about how the building would be used.
The new museum was to house the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votrouba Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with modern art.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishnitz was the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Secession of Vienna by Josef Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanser at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was "an exceptionally important place" for him, where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the challenges facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last renovation were much more serious, and the building was "energy-absorbing", says Kryshanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a fiberglass-reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel transitions of the thermal bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, a fallen lighthouse between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building, but still the elegant pavilion of Schwanser.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in an old red-brown color to protect against corrosion.
The movie theater hall is the same as it was before.
All this under strict control of the museum administration and on a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum board", says Kryshanitz, pointing to the uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and lightweight despite the limitations, problems and transformations.
Kryshanitz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical "drop in the city" story.
Such architecture "is not always in place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The 21st century house is in the right place, as the city's planning was a surprise success.
The 21st century house could be completed by the second building of the Chrysanthemum - collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city to place it next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's domestic anti-crisis plan, Bild reports that investments totaling about 300 million euros are planned for 2015.
The investment is designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and railways even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of owners and employees involved in snow cleaning on roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the necessary shots within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties in passenger transportation as it lacked reserves at the time of the deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railroad Service for years.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axis much more frequently for years after one of the ICE trains broke the axis at the main station in Cologne.
The Bank will pay a multi-million pound fine in the US
New trouble followed the unrest around Joseph Akkermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a multi-million pound fine in the US.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble at home, the past of the US industrial giant has now caught up with it.
The problem was with the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
Bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged credit unions down.
"We are pleased to have resolved this issue without the parties appealing to the court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank has not pleaded guilty to the deal.
The same goes for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the credit unions of the United States and intervenes in bankruptcy proceedings to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to make up for the billions of dollars in losses.
It's the first deal of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgages.
They're backed by internal loans.
This was the fate of a number of financial firms when the US real estate bubble burst in 2007.
American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the brink of financial crisis.
Years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a number of complaints, demanding compensation or punishment for fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the biggest complaints.
It accuses 18 of the world's largest banks of buying US credit unions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for about $200 billion in collateral.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by FHFA over numerous agreements totaling $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank headquartered in Frankfurt to take responsibility for "substantial losses", but has not yet disclosed the exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett is investing $10 billion in IBM.
The financial guru Buffett is actively investing in IBM.
Since March, he's bought over ten billion dollars worth of stock.
Warren Buffett, the largest American investor to date, has always said he won't invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investment was seen as a knight's act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now been given the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC, Buffett reported that he had acquired IBM stock for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know anything about his involvement until recently.
He praised the management that managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job", said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
For a significant amount of time, IBM has been focused on high-yield IT services like data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, now more than 100 years old, offers software and consulting services as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He said he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
He has invested in rail freight, lubricants and engineering.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and, with skilled investment, built one of the world's most expensive companies on its foundation.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest.
And he's become a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost flawless money-making instinct earned him the nickname "Oracles from Omaha".
IBM stock prices rose by one percent before the markets opened after Buffett's investment announcement.
The "Blue Giant", as IBM is also known, is worth over $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The inevitable danger
After the "cell in Zvikkau" was discovered, Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One of the papers is talking about a "bloody ideology" that's now coming back to the surface.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern became a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has sparked long-forgotten fears, since the burning of the Mellenic bombs in November 1992 and the Zolingen bombings in May 1993.
Never doubted, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network discovered today has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The revival of bloody ideology?" was the title of an online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence officer and expresses concern that the German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded calmly, commemorating victims of racial hatred with a silent picket outside the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the employment of workers at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was a slap in the face. "German 50th Anniversary Gift" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet portal Haber X that discusses the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German publication Hürriyet also made a similar comparison.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the title of Ahmed Qulahiji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The police's behavior and subsequent successful raid were sharply criticized on German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought of tracking suspected people in right-wing extremist circles sooner.
Some authors have come up with quite a sharp rhetoric: "If they continue to act as clumsy as they have, migrants will have no choice but to armed self-defense".
"It would be the best self-defense".
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on the way the entire network is opened and the legality of punishment", writes Selen.
The crimes in Mellen and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the peace in Germany.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply imprinted in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks that danger is looming, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Not repeating past mistakes
The Turkish press during that period mainly condemned the failure of the German police after the attacks.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the president of Turkey after the Zolingen fires, but his attendance at the memorial ceremony in Cologne was accepted by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech calculated the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he's determined a person's worth by the taxes they pay.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how much mistrust many German Turks have since grown in the present German state.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal at Lake Zurich
Most of Europe's leading risky banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been battling one crisis or another continuously ever since.
Now the German must get him back on track.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he was gonna get the part.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work in the no less spectacular post - Chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly enthusiastic, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has changed for the better".
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel".
But it was clear in September that things would be different.
The London trader UBS bypassed the bank's security system and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Ever since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said Tuesday, he will take over as board chairman in May, not 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He's an economics professor and a Central Bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he's definitely gonna need time to adapt.
He was suddenly responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that it had long earned the title of "the biggest banking scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very big -- until recently, it managed the world's largest assets -- and on the other hand, it hasn't been out of scandal for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is not spared.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a steady, steady, yet resourceful asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion dollars, which means it had more wealthy clients in the bank than any other bank in the world.
And as an investment bank, it's been in the league of the biggest banks in the world.
It was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking, a longtime lecturer at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: "I always cited UBS as an example of a good bank for my students".
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask how I could be so wrong".
He was really wrong.
It wasn't until 2007 that it became clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Woofley - who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we could guess why he left.
The investment division of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank has indeed found investors -- but investors that many bankers would have politely declined to serve until recently -- one very opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign wealth fund that is so hidden that it hasn't even been named.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and board chairman Marcel Opel - the second highest paid board chairman in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster struck, and due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was facing the threat of collapse, and the state had to rescue it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for convertible bonds with mandatory conversion to become co-owners of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of having huge banks in a small country.
After all, UBS's final balance sheet in 2007 was five times larger than all of Switzerland's output (see graph).
"We can't save UBS a second time", says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster happened shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was willing to hand over data from wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes through the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million in compensation for unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus more or less acknowledged that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for wealthy customers, the veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was not the same.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors have since resigned, and
The customer's money started to run out.
Within months, the bank lost confidence in both of its main areas of activity - investing due to failed speculations and managing assets as a result of aiding and abetting tax evasion.
And it just calmed down and it seemed like UBS had managed to turn things around, like this one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, one-time, and-time, all-time, one-time, all-time, one-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all-time, all
One thing's for sure, risk management in the investment department isn't working yet.
"The incident in Adoboli made it clear that risk control had not changed enough", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of Germany's largest banks also said: "The problem with UBS is that it has no risk-control tool".
It is the prudence that has long made Swiss bankers the keepers of the world's largest assets - not a risk, but a safety for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
UBS' Zurich headquarters still correspond to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only slightly larger.
It's a classic in its own right.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on the Banhofstrasse, which runs from the main station directly to the Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The hard door leads to the lobby of UBS.
Along the marble walls are large leather sofas, and next to the bank's emblem is a large "Safe" indicator.
UBS knows what its customers need, reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss concepts of banking - or, as the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He doesn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he also works with the two largest banks.
He believes UBS has become too big, particularly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if there is, they've been adapting to Anglo-Saxon customs for a long time".
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing it its first big profits and then a fiasco.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"On Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country's history", writes Lucas Hessig in his book Crash UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they'll say the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS were complementary: one was a wealthy but highly specialized bank in Zurich, specializing in asset management; the other was not so wealthy but much more internationalised.
Internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a large amount of money they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Woolfley, UBS Group's chief executive from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wolffley and Opel were a dream team", says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, a brilliant intellectual, a modest and deep understanding of models and statistics, and Opel with his inner instincts, who has gone all the way up from an intern at a bank".
But Opel finally got on Wolffley.
"He thought his models were real", says Geiger.
"This is tragic".
Maybe it's tragic, you know?
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the board meetings where Woolfley always repeated the same slogan - to push Goldman Sachs.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was head of the "tournament table", which was the place where banks' successes were introduced.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this list.
He's made it part of the way.
UBS was the largest player in the currency and government securities trade.
However, the authorized management consultants pointed to a weak spot, and by the parameter that is called "permanent income" in banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had a failure in American mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that cost him almost his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in substandard U.S. securities.
It evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further, continuing to take risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a way out of this process for a long time, UBS didn't stop.
"UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire", says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as the bank's attempts to get things right proved to be more difficult than it seemed.
The UBS post office has become a child's playground with chairs and remains unreliable to this day.
Anyone who heads this huge bank has an almost impossible task to face.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all the existing business models.
Bank analyst Geiger already has an idea: give up investment banking, focus on asset management, and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly curbed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only considered a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor Gruebel.
He has been able to show character in the past and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he is running UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in the mid-1990s.
It's cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that's not going to be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These are questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself.
He's still publicly saying that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
- Next year.
Recession fears in Europe are pulling down the American stock market
The looming recession in Europe has made American investors feel worse earlier this week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.

He also said that Europe was unlikely to shake up the recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed these fears, saying in an interview with CNBC that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do whatever it takes to end the crisis.
So, he thinks it's too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.

Smart crows fill cities
The crow is considered a problematic bird in many places, and experts say that these very intelligent birds will no longer be able to be driven out of the cities.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but the number of people complaining about dirt and noise is increasing in many settlements.
The solution to the bird problem, however, is far from being reached.
At the first symposium on crows in the eastern Frisian city of Ler, experts argued that it was no longer possible to drive crows out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected prawns, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction, and cutting down traditional tree-nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yever, Dipholz, Achima near Bremen and Lere there are large colonies, with more than 600 parent couples.
The unambiguous project of the rooster shooting in Ler caused unpopular newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described trapping birds and striking them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
"A normal move and a normal displacement is not good", said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lera.
Breaking down nests with water or cutting down trees often has adverse effects, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and the larger colonies are divided and spread to other areas".
The only way to scare people is to avoid them near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, get rid of them is not an option".
Separating from the surrounding areas will not solve the problem in cities", says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kölner.
Combining the fear of birds from needing to be protected and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a solution.
"Information booths instead of gasoline" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Utoya Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We have to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem".
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the lives of highly intelligent crows.
The project is already attracting tourist interest.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on the complaints about the noise produced by birds. "The noise conveys a lot of information.
The mind and softness of these birds have become legendary, and the graci often use tools not only to master the attractive piece, but also to make the tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested a measure of bird mind on four graces.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that to get a mole, they had to knock on a board.
Without any training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down a slab.
In another experiment, the smart players had to solve a more complex task.
The researchers placed a small bucket of mold in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get a beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to tie the handle to the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players have done it on their first try.
Ronaldo takes Portugal out of the Euro 2012
The Bosnians and Turks' hopes of last-minute victory were long gone.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last in the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1), perfectly forming their fifth Euro exit after 0:0 in the first leg.
The Czechs were just 1-0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against the outsider Montenegro after a clean win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily achieved a 1:1 (1:0) score against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Neilder Posthiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Wolfsburg player Zvezdan Misimović and captain Emir Spakić reduced the difference by two points thanks to a penalty result on the 41st minute and a goal on the 65th for Bosnia.

Portugal has already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.

Ronaldo took an early start, striking a free kick from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long range skills, increasing the score to 2-0 from a 25-meter mark.
The Bosnians, who didn't open the score in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to striker Edina Jaco.
The former Wolfsburg player from Manchester City's English championship leader sent the ball with his head to the bottom of the barrel on the 33rd minute, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Yiraček scores for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was on judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding .
After the attack on Elder Posthiga in the Bosnian penalty area on the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was faking it, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for hand play after Fabio Kuentran's foul - Misimovich sold it.
After the break, the 2004 European Champions have scored four more goals.
Peter Yiracek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships are the fifth time in a row that they have qualified for the European Championships.
The team of coach Michael Bilek and Bundesliga legends Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (first FC Nuremberg) also had a smile after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech in the 9th minute with instant reflex prevented potential auto goal of Thomas Sivok.
Montenegro had the best chance when the duo of Stefan Yovetic and Dejan Damijanovich were on the field.
Damyanovich hit from the edge of the penalty area on the 40th minute and scored a goal for Czechoslovakia.
After the break of the stang, he saved the already-trampled world-class goalkeeper of the Czech Republic after the forward of FC Seoul left the field at the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after a 0-3 loss in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than 0-0 in Zagreb.
Although there is little doubt that coach Gus Hiddink will now take his place on the bench of the team that finished third in 2002, the Croats are now in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks were able to make an almost perfect start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximire Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long shot in the seventh minute hit the stand, and the attacker Kazim Kazim failed to hit the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and took control of the game more and more.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legends Daniel Pranitch (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Shieldenfeld (Aintrach, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukic of the Wolfsburg team, who gave up the place to Ivan Perishich of Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapatoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which had already looked confident in their place after a 4-0 victory in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Steven Ward.
Konstantin Vasiliev from the guest team tied the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland was on a good pace from the start, but it wasn't until the 23rd minute that Robbie Keane of Los Angeles scored his first clean-cut.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender was able to prevent him from leading Ireland.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing goalkeeper Paul Londac's defense, Ward was in the right place and, by passing the ball through the line, changed the score to 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its employees in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it plans to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
"We will create more research and development opportunities and employ thousands of people", said Bill McDermott, one of SAP's executive directors, in a statement at the Beijing Consumer Expo.

Mass murder is a human dimension
Peter Englund's tense and very good new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of characters whose hearts are still running out.
Here's the tip: carefully cut this page and use it as a keyword.
You'll get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of people will be your GPS, your beacon in the moments when, like one of these men and women, you'll stray off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "anti-history work".
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; it has almost no ambassadors, skilled journalists, or discussions of tactics and combat technology.
It is not so much a book about what was, he explains, as a "book about what it was like". It is a "book about feelings, impressions, experiences, and states of mind".
The book "Beauty and Sorrow" has interwoven the experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women over the years, on both sides of the front line, from school girls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and staff.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses an arm or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are shining like church candles here, new ones being added to many others, and some of them going out.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It's an amendment to the idea that World War I was just a tough trench war on the Western Front.
Beauty and Sorrow is a masterpiece of the other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being hit by beehives; one of them is celebrating Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the cece flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War covers these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like smokeless powder.
When a gunshot is heard nearby and you're a woman and you're home with your kids, will you stay or run?
Who's that anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war.
"The lack of facts", notes Mr. Englund, "is filled with speculation, speculation, hope, fear, compulsive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors".
Beauty and Sorrow follows the fortunes of people like Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters, and other published material.
The stories of their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to the minute details and details Mr. Englund collected.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
He tells the story of a German school girl, and he says, "Erzats, erzats everywhere".
"Coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He keeps talking about the German ersatz food.
He describes "meat of pressed rice, cooked in barley fat (and decorated with fake bone, made of wood); tobacco, made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes, cut with wood".
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes authorized for sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American observes the urge to be cruel and says of war: "You feel that, after all, that's what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, an evening paper or a bestseller and claim that this show is civilization and that under your rusty-fried shirt with a pair of scarves there is no barbarian".
A British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he will most likely die and no one will notice or be saddened.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will be in front of an audience", he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's a lot like "a convicted man hanged in secret".
Other comments concern the old Europe, which is falling apart, and new forms of fear.
"The conflict was becoming more and more an economic competition", Mr. Englund writes, "a war of factories".
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the beast of the new century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched costume who arranges a massacre while sitting at a desk".
People act in unpredictable ways: humble acts as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund told of soldiers who tried to get prostitutes to have a venereal disease to avoid service on the front lines.
"The most grotesque expression of this is the trade in honorary dung, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in hopes of getting into a hospital", he writes.
"All the desperate people rubbed his eyes, often leading to lifelong blindness".
Mr. Englund's prose translated from Swedish by Peter Graves is flexible but unpretentious, perfectly suited to his humanitarian task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war "liberated forces beyond control: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassell's "The Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "On the Western Front Without Change", rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this non-template pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending I can remember in nonfiction.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached the page with the list of characters in the book, grabbed it from your hands and lit it with a match.
After the previous error , a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some in protective helmets.
The Monday-to-Tuesday night shift was chosen because Zuccotti Park was supposed to be the least crowded at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few senior officers, the rest of whom were told they were going to training.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence underscored how much the Police Department values operations.
There could be no mention of repeating episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of liquefied natural gas against protesters, which was contrary to the regulations of the department and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation to free the protesters from the Zuccotti Park began.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis drills were conducted on Randells Island with the countdown to Zuccotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills -- counterterrorism measures that require the rapid relocation of large numbers of police officers -- with the intention of lower Manhattan.
Last training was Monday night on the East River side of Manhattan.
The order to enter the park came "at the last minute", a source familiar with the orders said, referring to the task only as "training".
"The few cops I know who were called to this case didn't say they were going to Zuccotti Park", said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zuccotti Park were in the highest offices in the department".
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clean up the park, but retreated before hundreds of protesters who rushed in before the deadline, hearing about these plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police departments, including the district police force, which they typically used to control the criminal surroundings.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like to work, come and go from the park during the day, making 1 o'clock at night a good time to attack.
"It was right to do it when the park had the fewest people", he said.
Rescue vehicles with headlights and speakers, gathered at Pike's Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The projectors and the pre-recorded announcements carried by loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply packed their things and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to pack.
Other police groups, witnesses said, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case the park needed arrests.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the chief of police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police were being rude to them.
Mr. Brown said the cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could have taken the picture.
As police drove west through a pile of protesters' personal belongings, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags full of clothes, the Sanitation Department followed her, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, and photos of them soon went online.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some had barricades, and the police would go in and methodically arrest them.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter tied themselves together by the hands.
And two people tied themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue workers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleanup was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "violation of public order and resistance to detention", he said.
The most senior officer on the job was Joseph J. Esposito, department head and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "was not in charge of the operation", Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to get inside.
The fences were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw the police from these positions extend the perimeter even further beyond the boundaries of the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night happened south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, witnesses said, were breathing air from the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of a fan flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Schools ' union will sue the city for dismissal
The union, which represents hundreds of school service staff who lost their seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students attend.
The court case is probably the last resort available to the 37th District Council, which is trying to dismiss the firing.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest-paid workers lost their seats on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to health care funds run by workers' groups to close a budget hole last spring.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At City Council hearings last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members parried, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be fired.
Representatives from District 37 County Council said they have filed a notice of complaints, notifying the Department of Education that a lawsuit has been filed against him; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing of the lawsuit in Manhattan's state Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and list eight temporarily dismissed employees as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as do most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary complaint filed with the New York Times, the union focused on a number of school layoffs in poor neighborhoods in the city to support claims of unfair treatment, claiming poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and there were few in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support workers lost seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants working at Harlem's free high school 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "These are not neighborhoods of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget shortfalls".
P.S. The 36th Budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated additional funding for every poor student who went to school.
The union also claims that school principals could have been misled by the language of the notification authorizing the dismissal of parent-coordinators.
The notice used the word "overpayment", although "overpayment" is more often used when a teacher from the school's payroll is moved to a list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators have been fired", the draft lawsuit says, "not just transferred".
Mission completed, Congress ready for a deal on Libya
It seems the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the Libyan uprising.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, for the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for the American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to consider a resolution proposed by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut) that praises the Libyans for their successful insurgency and the American troops for their "courage".
"The purpose of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It's a confirmation of their support for democratic aspirations by both parties".
The language may seem harmless, but no other discussion about Libya has gone easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and the White House over a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the U.S. military in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a significant majority of both parties and never made it to the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House, the House also rejected a proposal to cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
It left the American mission in a kind of legislative clearinghouse -- when Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually kick the ground running in it.
Then events overtook the Congress ' indecision .
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
NATO's mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee's resolution "admires the Libyan people for their incredible bravery and extraordinary perseverance in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who have participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The resolution also "affirms the United States' national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measures have the full support of the Council on Foreign Relations or will the legislature split like the June bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader on the Committee, opposed the latter.
A spokesman for Luger said Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is expected to vote this week for a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House member Bob Goodlat (R-V), would be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote in Congress this term.
Other lawmakers have not yet been able to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlat Amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this session.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House and Senate, others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget amendments in the House of Representatives alone and some on "control of federal spending".
Some of them are identical, too, but they give their authors - mostly freshly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resume - the opportunity to boast that they have "proposed" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote in favor of a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a nonbinding resolution supporting the amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office for members of Congress, and House member Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to repeal the two-term limitation for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for years, as has another amendment banning the burning of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states object.
As many members of Congress as they have tried to propose amendments, they are moving less quickly than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th Congress, 66 were introduced.
This is a slow pace compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the Senate Library.
But they've been no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated", Giffords says in his first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the face at a public event in Tucson, House member Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal network Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Rises Tomorrow" and said he wanted to get better than to return to Congress.
Appearing on ABC News's "20/20" with Diana Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating suggestions and needed walking help.
The program showed her the difficult path of recovery from a bullet wound that shattered her skull and punctured her left side of the brain, from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the House of Representatives and triumphantly voted on the debt limit bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Giffords, 41, said, "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long special "20/20", which was shown on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special told about how Giffords recovered from the January 8 shooting.
In the video, Kelly was shot in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and her physical therapists are teaching her how to do simple things.
Shake your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word was, "What".
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word, "toast", asking to change the breakfast menu.
A video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see a congressman sing along with doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Lauper and "Friendly Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she doesn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband told me that he was reading a Giffords article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
The suspected attacker, Jared Lee Laffner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being treated for enforcement pending trial.
"Many people have died", said Giffords Sawyer.
"Tough, heavy, heavy".
One day, while she was recovering, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated".
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just a hit.
And you'll get through it, you'll recover and you'll come back stronger than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a Wall Street celebration that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines were alerted to the scene.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes", said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the concert, which also included the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullane, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans", the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect. It was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are being praised for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, the military says.
The public is acting more and more like they feel sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon to leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as miserable".
It's a sensitive subject for military leaders who don't want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger that returned troops faced in the final years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity is quiet and only between veterans.
After his two sons returned from the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two different perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration because they have been crowding rebels and visiting exotic places.
Others will wonder if "a cruel evil veteran is hiding under the mask", said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-ranking government position in Washington.
While looking for work, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could handle the stress of a responsible job in Washington right after the war.
Kenshne recalls telling his sons, "When you talk about your ministry, you should expect negative feedback".
The embarrassment the military experiences is partly due to American indifference to war.
Battlegrounds are rarely won by praise from a country that knows little about the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was commonly done in World War II", says retired Lt. Gen. David Barnow, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mostly centered on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
The army is rated by the number of campaigns it has made, the number of comrades it has lost, or the scale of the losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters of rape
This week, a historic court hearing is set to decide whether 28 men and women will be sued against the army for non-violence.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
First-class private Elizabeth Lyman is 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, she claims, was raped by her partner at night.
It was October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend and met a male coworker carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go into her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag", Lyman says.
But the Texas native has overcome her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts".
Minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from behind, beat her up and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be anxiously awaiting a court ruling at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether to take the lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to cope with widespread violence in the military in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Washington, D.C. lawyer Susan Burke, initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or threatened with sexual assault by fellow officers and that the military did not properly investigate, prosecute or provide due justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she targeted the top ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also says that she has been linked to about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Instead of bringing all the plaintiffs in this case together - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she'll open up a lot of cases if she needs to keep up the pressure.
The Defense Department's defense team, led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride, has taken steps to shut down the case.
The court documents that Newsweek received reveal a defense strategy - mainly one that former or current soldiers cannot bring claims against the military for damage done to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine named in the Supreme Court's 1950 Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for any damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the plaintiffs' military service", the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially forbidden to fight, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the combat zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed in the war between the two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to be modern, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her claim, three others are preparing.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Law Service Seminar is preparing a case against four major military academies for inciting a woman-hating atmosphere.
A separate nonprofit organization of American veterans of the Vietnam War is filing a lawsuit against the military, which is centered on the diagnosis of "personality changes" that victims of violence endure to remove them from service, a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Task Force.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the VA in December accusing it of discriminatory practices in handling pension applications from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence while in the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, the Department of Defense's Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service reported 3,158 attempted rapes.
But as you know, attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon estimates that this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases that went to court in 2010: 20 percent of known cases went to court - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case call the assault on them the first of a series of injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times to the police, doctors, and commanders' deputies.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive rating to the defendant, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was having a baby, so I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"They put me in a mental hospital, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial against him.
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a change in personality that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with a disfavorable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the lawsuit brought by Lyman and her associates will go forward is a complex question, says John Terry, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "I think they can move forward".
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came out.
I have been a critic of the Ferris Doctrine my whole life.
The military is decades behind because it lacks the incentives and restraints that responsibility imposes.
He adds: "The odds are against them to a great extent... but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will bring together hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reforms are made", she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a regular guy who put his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to committing a mass murder in Norway in July that killed 77 people, appeared for his first open court hearing.
Although Breivik could operate alone, he was far from alone on the web: he spent a lot of time preparing for an attack behind his computer, talking to millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy - you just have to go to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to approach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European cyberpopulism by the British research centre DEMOS.
The personal data on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint the demographic with scientific accuracy - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then put them on the market, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a survey that asked questions about their level of education, attitude to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving their offices.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: Online right-wing supporters are mostly young men who are unhappy with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with their offline activity are smarter, more democratic, and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor".
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to explore everything in the world - from health issues to social trends expressed in "Likes", wall posts, and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook's "super-current" information is driving a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site's title in the headline by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows people to study people who can't be reached on the street with a notebook.
"In the past, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them".
"You would have to join a party, and they would never accept you", says Bartlett.
"Facebook excludes all this - you go directly to them".
Others say that this site could help identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that peers of students, such as their hostel instructors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating his status as a drunk.
"You can't solve a problem without identifying it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute of Seattle.
"We found a way to identify children from the risk group who would otherwise not be detected".
Facebook also constantly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The site's data processing team has processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, midterm voter turnout in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mostly using information that only they have access to - cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what happens when Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for doing offline research, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the possibility of a researcher watching their profiles", says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using publicly accessible student Facebook pages.
"As far as they could imagine, it was just between them and their friends".
Then the question arises about the methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
You can't tell on Facebook how much information on a user's profile or page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things", says Selvin.
That's why, despite years of research in technology, Selvin thinks that a notebook and a pen are still the best research tools you can use.
"Nothing can replace going out into the real world and interacting with real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of social research is still happening offline".
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Bering Brewick is going to be publicly tried for the first time.
Anders Bering Breivik, the man who confessed to organizing the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway", he said before 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit the actions, but I don't admit the guilt".
Judge Torquell Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech with him, to speak to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from access to the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take all visits and correspondence under strict control for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Brevick in the eye, others of making sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman", one of the survivors on Utoya told NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but I personally felt a little easier after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Brewick maintained calmness and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange idea that he was part of a larger resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically lessen the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now experiencing.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't", said a relative of one of the victims.
"It would be much easier if it were".
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview that's showing at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest discovery in a recently discovered interview, which they recalled in the lead-up to the opening screening in the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and in manufacturing technology.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and a moderniser of the manufacturing process, who believed that many business executives suffered from the "disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of skilled labor".
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the TV series Triumph of Nerves about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs on a unique, lengthy conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was fired from Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company NeXT waiting for the massive Internet boom.
While a small portion of the interview was used in the Nerds, he says the original interviews were lost during transportation.
It wasn't until after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is coming out at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
To a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to present his technological philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are four different moments in an interview where there are large intervals between questions and answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems annoyed by the issues of the Kringley, causing him to move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar, iPod and iPhone Lost Interview, there's something more horrifyingly prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the post-mortem evaluations of Jobs, but there's something hurtful and inspiring about the job we see here, a troubled dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said it all here, he went and did it.
A little summary of seven important conclusions from the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All my time in business, I've been asking, 'Why do you do this?' and the answers you're always getting are, 'Oh, that's just the way it's done.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks deeply about business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his efforts to streamline Apple's reporting.
Disillusioned with the way he recorded expenses, which often started with "standard expenses" that were taken from the ceiling and then tracked down by "clearing", he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
The joke about the Pope:
Jobs details the blue box he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack into a phone company efficiently and make long-distance calls for free.
There's been a lot of talk about the device before, but the euphoria of Jobs here describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a cell phone, ordering a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been screaming at the phone, and it's been going to the next phone a minute later", says Jobs, smiling.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could master something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have made it without it.
Jobs goes on to describe one famous escape he and Wozniak practically made by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call him on the phone, trying hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two laughed right before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett 's cold calling):
At age 12, while hunting for spare parts to assemble a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a big impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a little monitor with an electron tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to drive HP a lot as a teenager and I used to go around that car and write programs for it.
About improvised innovation:
In several interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products for the summer.
Early in his career, when he went to sell a handful of assembly boards, one buyer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
Working just 30 days on the loan, he had to think about both assembling and delivering the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I went out and found a designer".
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Big companies losing energy:
Long before he led the Apple revival, Jobs clearly predicted that many industry leaders would go wrong in seeing the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the helm of the company, and the people who make the product, they're being pushed out of the decision-making platform.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being overshadowed by people who have no idea what the difference is between good and bad products - the skill required.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire IT industry.
It could be ten times bigger, it could be a Microsoft of the '90s...
They've lost the game.
About innovation as an art form:
"A great idea is separated from a great product by a great deal of skill... when you unfold a great idea, it changes and grows".
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots, or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- putting them all together...
In the end, it all comes down to taste -- it all comes down to trying to express yourself in the best way that humans have ever produced, and then trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been embarrassed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best information technology professionals in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with the health law opponents while the court handles the case.
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious question of whether it would hear President Obama's health care bill, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, celebrated a dinner sponsored by a law firm that will challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
This case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One of the agenda items was a petition backed by 26 states challenging the rapid health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that brought conservative activists together across the nation.
The judges agreed to hear the case; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour round-trip is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a stumbling block in the presidential race, which will be at its height by the time the verdict is announced.
The lawyer who will stand up in court and say the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society luncheon, a long-standing conservative legal group.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
Attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health care law.
The guests of honor at lunch?
Nothing new. Two judges have been attending the Federalist Society for years.
And that's not against ethics at all.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they had obeyed, they might have fallen under Code Principle 4C, which states: "A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or be mentioned in the program of such events".
However, Scalia and Thomas' apparent proximity to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
"This staggering violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the claims of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Pleas.
"Judges drank and ate at a formal fundraiser with lawyers whose cases are now being heard in court".
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say they're very willing to mix court cases with the federalist-style groups involved.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan who is the ethical issue, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed at the trial court level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan decline to hear the case because she was too involved in law enforcement back then to be impartial now.
Kagan never showed that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion orders for aircraft
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is getting orders for 50 of its products.
But it's a big deal when this company is Boeing Co., and the price tag for all 50 of these planes is $18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold rush of future orders for aircraft.
In a forecast published Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in dollar terms for commercial aircraft this weekend - 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine aircraft.
The amazing order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy 20 more aircraft that will raise the total price of pre-show to $26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliners, which can boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price tag for six planes will be over $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular customers is quite high".
Many of the Middle East's airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for planes, but they also have the fuel price increase, which usually hurts airlines, because it's one of their biggest expense items, not so destructive because the country makes money on high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel when prices go up, Diora said.
"They have natural protection", he said.
Emirates' order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from attempting to gain its dominance with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's air show victory came four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axle load after customers demanded an increase in lift and flight range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister apparently lost the election in Michoacán.
Louise Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped the rival Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister apparently failed to run for governor of Michoacán during the tough state election, and she said on Monday that drug dealers helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader in the race for the Western State Governor's seat.
"The interference of organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country", said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the election... they grabbed the polling stations, they put up obstacles... and they made people vote" for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She's preparing for a return, and winning Michokoan is a big step in that effort.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Valliho seems to have just slightly outpaced Calderon, who was leading the ratings before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureole, a left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party candidate, or DPR, who now holds the governorship seat, came in third - a major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureole also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Valliho, a former mayor of the state capital of Morellia, denied any ties to drug dealers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
For a long time, the drug cartels of Michoacan had been dominated by marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It's President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Louise Marie Calderon, and several candidates withdrew from the local primary race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, however terrible the election in Michoacan may look, the party's momentum will be the driving force behind the victory.
The man who is to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this win should be very encouraging on the eve of next year".
ADB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB's Manila office, said the two fastest growing major economies should "do everything they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries are looking at Europe's problems "unbiasedly", and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's about all of us".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable".
"So if China and India can help, they must".
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing has risen alarmingly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's ongoing debt crisis has raised fears that it could reverse the global economy and has prompted calls for leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nagh predicted that any Asian aid would be delivered through the IMF, but he said that bilateral cooperation -- like buying bonds from the EU's financial aid fund, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provides a huge bargaining power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's commerce minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is currently experiencing a decline in exports and a decrease in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have big goals, and we have to keep our growth going".
"It's not an option, it's a condition, because that's where we'll find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls".
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshny, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe's 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they'll learn that Greeks retire at 50 and go to the seaside for the holidays, and that's not going to be well received", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek large and well-paid public sector workers working in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatened "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
The Bank's forecast for 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing "lowering risks" due to threats from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to develop "emergency plans" to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon 's fearful warnings about potential cuts to defense spending
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated the situation Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already used to cutting $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina.
He said the Congress' failure to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester are triggering a 23 percent overall cut and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a drastic reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We'll also have to lay off a lot of our full-time employees, and as the cutting is going to happen so quickly, we're almost certainly going to have to lay off full-time employees to get there".
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our military and will seriously damage our readiness".
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"While military financing in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be seriously affected by a major disruption in the basic budgets", Panetta warned.
"The contractual staff will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of the contracts and supervision contracts that the troops maintain".
"State personnel will be cut, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted".
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The sequester at the Department of Defense will result in the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We stand firm against these dragon acts", the senators said in a joint statement Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
"This is not a way we can live with, and it's not a way we have to impose on ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter or the Senators' latest warnings will lead to a budget compromise or strengthen calls for the Pentagon to be exempt from cuts, we'll see later.
Panetta was completely honest about the possible cuts, even though he came to work for the Pentagon after years of budgeting in Congress and the White House and realizing he was facing a tough choice.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what could follow -- a shell-filled army without a nuclear weapon.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"This is a bullet-free squad".
"It's a wing of an airplane without a trained pilot".
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from a volatile fighting spirit, poor readiness and inability to fight potential enemies".
"It actually encourages aggression".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he outlined new details of how cuts "create significant operational risks: slow down response to crises, conflicts, and disasters; severely limit our ability to be first in deployment and response anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed tests, and some are only in the early planning stages.
This list includes the F35 single-seat fighter, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship, and a new ground combat vehicle needed by the Army and Marine Corps to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it's a vital next step to improving and countering potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Liar
A quick look at the latest headlines shows just how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging accusations of sexual harassment by several women; each side is accusing the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury for allegedly hiding that a retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught talking to US President Barack Obama on a microphone that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies ruin careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Wayner made a fool of himself by denying his conclusions, which were quickly refuted by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with campaign finance fraud related to the cover-up of extramarital affairs.
And again, no one living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was lied to about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating in school and college exams are commonplace.
There were instances when teachers gave students answers to tests in order to get a good score for their own activities.
Teachers who are supposed to teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Research shows that you can be lied to 10 to 200 times in a day.
It's now assumed that a significant part of this is salvation lies.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of dating.
Detecting a lie or proving a lie is a skill that is necessary for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, like, say, a charade where you have to say, "It's over!" detecting lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One study found that most of the old myths about lying had been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't always get stuck, itchy, red or creamy.
It is not necessary to conclude that liars are difficult to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of the claims, the look, the structure of the questions, and the timing characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lying, and it's clear that lying detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps you navigate in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel free, controlling their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more often about others, usually to protect someone's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are often false).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty about cheating on you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "determining the initial state".
This helps provide a starting point for further evaluation of changes.
Watch your posture, laughter, voice characteristics.
You'd better know if a person is always knocking with his legs in a normal state, so you don't make unfair accusations when you see a knock in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups like red flags, not evidence of deception.
Cheaters can capture the upper part of their body when they're trying to remember their story, they can set their feet in the direction of the door, they can lean toward the exit, they can change their posture in a certain way, or they can show "relieving after an interview" -- that exaggerated breath of relief and a change of posture when all the complicated questions are behind them.
Investigators often falsify the end of questioning signal to just watch the relief after the interview.
So, listen to the speech of your subject.
Scott Peterson is known to have backed down and used his past to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a nationwide manhunt.
The people who are in the mood can also use the distance in the speech, "I didn't have sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely tangible.
Someone might use "qualification language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to be honest... as far as I know... as far as I know".
This makes the response more emotional than actual, and it's often a red flag.
There is no magic to detect lies, but you can master the ability to detect deceit.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not falling prey to skilled cheaters in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipeline construction plan needs to be revised after the U.S. threat to delay its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating the unions but calming environmentalists -- the company that is building the pipeline says it will be willing to review the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills area of Nebraska and is confident the project will still get approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, though with a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week it would postpone the federal project until it explores new routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sandhills area and the Ogalala Aquarium, a vast underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward", said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to delay decision making until 2013, after elections next year, although authorities have denied that politics were involved.
Obama in a written statement last week called the decision a State Department appeal, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline is to run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to move 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to the oil refineries in Texas.
To do that, he's got to cross six states.
It's hated by environmentalists, but loved by trade unions, who hope to create about 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to expedite the move from the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, the primary source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but an energy industry source said the Department's auditor ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, is a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the original study was inappropriate, as it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle was sued for allegedly causing fearful nausea in the child.
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patty LaBelle began to roar in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to the point that she was stung by fear.
The lady Marmalade's performance was so frightening to 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she endured "a change of personality, a sleep disorder" and "a strong fear of strangers", her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Somebody came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her", she said.
LaBelle made a speech to a pregnant woman in a rage.
"She said aggressively, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door,'" said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started using curses -- the C word and the F word -- in a high pitched tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle ran into her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escort had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The girl cried so loudly that she stung, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note requesting an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives are not answering any comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not disclosed, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBelle accountable for her actions", Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially with a kindergarten teacher holding an 18-month-old child".
Climate problems have slowed down the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labor market increased, foreign funding decreased and the economy was weakened.
2011 - a year that will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdés, also called the year of change, which generated great hopes for economic development, but given the unfavourable climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however, there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February not only caused millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they also limited the growth potential of the state economy, causing economic activity to decline by 3.6 percent overall in the first half of the year, largely due to the historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on frozen areas provided by the Mexican Council for Rural Sustainability, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, by November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share rose to 5.28 percent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 percent, a share that by population count is more than 74,000 Sinaloa unemployed residents, which is 18,969 people more than the first half.
Reduced liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been discussed by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
"What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment that is linked to several factors, including a loss of market liquidity to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because people who illegally own dollars find it difficult to work with, invest in, and use them in anything", he said.
The immigration is suspended
Lopez Cervantes said there's a demographic factor in the unemployment rate.
"The number of people who leave the state to seek work abroad in the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulty of entry, and secondly because once they enter, they already face many difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, resulting in rising unemployment", he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa's labor market analysis is getting worse when you look at the high number of labor violations that prevail, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state's active population works without being mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities in registration, another reminder of working in the state is low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Welfare.
Sinaloa workers' monthly average income was 5,352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July, the state's FDI was $630,697.
The state government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded a total of 17,280,000 pesos of investment over the year, mostly for service companies.
Debt
In the wake of the economic downturn, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a 3 billion pesos loan that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and by November, no debt gains were expected in any sector of the state economy.
The reaction
For business people, the first year of Mario Lopez Valdés's government demonstrates a lack of government capability.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that there was a lack of consensus among various sectors, including the state government itself, during 2011.
"The economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, it takes a lot of work to get back to the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, first of all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowdown in the economy
Lopez Loredo said events like the early freezes have stalled the state's economy this year and its efficiency and growth have been limited.
"Low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including a frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not getting fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore at the end of the year we close it below our expectations", he said.
Revisiting the direction
Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue its most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we found that we were working on this, we believe that we need to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, we need to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program", he said.
He noted that the current administration has made progress in its own manner of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is getting involved and that I can say that some work has been done and I think the government is aware that there is much more to be done", he said.
He 's getting sentenced for eight kilograms of marijuana .
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days' income - a sentence for eight kilograms of marijuana.
The prosecutor general's office said the convicted drug trafficker Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, was in this case possession of marijuana for distribution.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on June 7, 2010, during a patrol on Cipriano Valdez Street, outside post number 80 in El Castillo, Navolatos.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck carrying a black bag in a box in the car, and a small backpack in the passenger seat where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized property was transferred to the Second District Court, and the accused continues to remain a prisoner in the Crime Legal Consequences Support Center.
You have to make contributions to the work.
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Rescue Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk being left unfinished or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while the work programs were still in development, they were in danger as the state government was unable to make the appropriate contributions, which amounted to over 11 million pesos for all three programs.
He noted that the total funding for all three programs is about 50 million pesos, of which the state should contribute 25 percent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality provided the resources for the work, so there is still a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million and even though the year is ending, they haven't given us a penny, when since the beginning of July they had to give us a part", he said, "so that we don't delay, we started work and they have made great progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Agillar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the term of office the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial means to participate and the programs continued to develop, and this year to access these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state still owes", he explained.
While the state has an obligation to deliver these resources, he says the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to increase efforts to get the interest rates that apply to them as quickly as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny".
The court will approve the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The shift from analog to digital is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (Supreme Court) rejected constitutional claims by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree that moves the so-called "transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to overturn it were not cast.
A minority of the four ministers, including the court's President, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes needed for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional because regulating radio and television programs is a law-enforced right for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to disprove the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he disagreed with the draft's arguments in the sense that the federal executive cannot define the general rules for measures to be prepared by the state administration.
"I also do not believe that if this happens, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and reminded that planning public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is relevant to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, governance of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that has occurred in recent years, resulting in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transforming into a digital form that includes meeting societal needs that has not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, including a group of authorities that the Constitution unites into the state executive power".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures that the laws passed by the Legislature are upheld in the administrative sphere, he said.
In Michoacan, they're analyzing the ability to count "voice by voice"
According to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, which are 879 out of a total of 6,074 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is real for the election process this year in Michoacan, where, according to data from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PPRD), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, which are 879 out of a total of 6,074 minutes.
In light of this, the chairman of the General Council of the Michoacan Institute of Elections (IEC), Maria de Los Angeles Llanderal Saragossa, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral college approved a set of principles to align local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be noted that Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the state Electoral Code or the Voting Rights Act, as the state Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal term for their entry into force in this election process and Governor Lionel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the deadlines set by the law in the Official Gazette of the state, stating that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim by the local legislature and called the state's constitutional reform representative's voice "untrue and illegal" because he had no right to "allow or support them".
In an interview about the possibility of "voice for voice" Maria de los Angeles Llanderald argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IAM it would be possible for the local electorate to submit a partial or full count of votes.
For example, a partial recount of one or more polling stations may be made on the condition that: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no voting and document counting record in the polling station or it is not with the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, a general count of votes in all polling stations may take place when there is evidence that the difference between the presumed winner of the elections and the second-place candidate in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that put forward the second candidate.
The total number of votes will also be counted if at the end of the usual counting it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took second place, in the event that the polling stations that were taken into account in the partial counting are excluded.
It is worth noting that elections are in Moralia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting 129 votes out of a total of 923 in the minutes.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; a memorial service was held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sapaliname Mountains.
After taking condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, Basio Cortés' family returned to the capital city of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with the closest people attending the ceremony at Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends were visiting.
At 5:30 p.m., he attended the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team that included Felipe Basio while he was in high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sapalinama Mountains, and he always told his family and friends", said Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister.
She believes the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and a loving brother, devoted to his family".
Felipe Cortes Basio left Saltillo at a very young age to attend the College of Aviation in Sappone, Jalisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he was a freak in a truck, but he always wanted to be a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Marta Saagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sappopán for his relative's graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying.
He's being escorted to the last road.
Gunfire proceeded in honor of Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and state government, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the heads and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he attended in 1985 and had success both in school and in sports, led him to the final road.
Basio Cortés was killed recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Moray, and six others, all from that ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basio Cortés (cremated), a Saltillo resident, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martinez, on the esplanade of a training school where he was already awaited by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at the N.L. Cadereet farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was discovered 1.5 kilometers down Cadereita Highway towards Santiago, on a hill in the commune known as El Castillo.
A few people passing by noticed that the gate was locked in a village house painted beige and brown.
Looking inside, literally three meters, they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately reported it to the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white shirt.
Nearly one meter was another man's body, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there was no shell on the spot.
There are signs on the village walls of one organized crime group and another, and there are several bullet holes in the wall and the gate.
11 captured at Caderet
The Department of Homeland Security has identified 11 people, including a minor who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in Kaderaite Municipality, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burial.
According to the release, eight people were initially detained in the Los Alveros Colony on November 11, and one person who was hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three homes and a phone, demanding that they become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., when military personnel were patrolling the Old Ranch village in Kadereite, when they saw a car with no license plates and two men in the cabin.
After stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, a machine gun and 18 cartridges.
Later, after these statements, at 2 p.m. on November 13, one of their accomplices was stopped on La Prada's public land, who, seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Heena and Kadereit.
On Wednesday , a new Italian government will be formed .
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present a new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic catastrophe.
Italy's appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president on Wednesday to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic catastrophe and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to introduce a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive branch will take its position.
Monty said he would present the president with the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles were overcome.
"The structure is well-outlined now", he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought the size of their debt to a critical level
The administration led by former European Commissioner Monty must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from Monte to hurry, volatile markets set a 10-year yield on Italy's BTP bonds at more than 7 percent, a level Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegali, leader of the Italian Employers' Federation, told reporters after meeting Monty: "We said we would actively support this government".
We believe this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, to reporters.
The support of the LDP, Italy's largest party, is important because until now many of its members have opposed the governmental majority of technocrats that Monty forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspending of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure, warning that the failure of Monti could be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He's finishing his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, who allowed an extremely fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief hiatus at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy's debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy with a 1.8 billion euro debt would be too much for the modern financial backers of the eurozone.
Monti said his government would exist until the next election scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to reform before another election was scheduled.
Monti said he would like politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be composed of only technical experts, a sign of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources said that the mutual distrust and disagreement of the parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more gaming experience than the Ticos.
Of the 22 players announced in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players declared has played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica, compared to the 22 players called by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the World and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, have a whole list of Class A qualifiers, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one to have played 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star League and in the strong clubs of the English Premier League, have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this we must add the experience of the Spanish fury in the difficult qualifying for the Euro or the World Cup.
The Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the Spanish national team's goalkeeper, Iker Casillas, leads the list, who last Sunday against England (the 0-1 loss in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisaretta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play Tricolor today and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javier Hernandez, player of Barcelona, has 106 games.
Casillas and Xavi were recognised as the best last week by UEFA alongside another Iberian team player, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and scorer Shalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost a hundred Carles Poyoles with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villia and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Sesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From Costa Rica, next to Michael Umana, left-sided Junior Diaz with 48 matches and striker Brian Ruis with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the line in 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Assofeif with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36, and Jose Luis López with 35.
The rest of them.
He has played more than 30 games in Spain for Gerard Peque (37), Sergio Busquetz (36), Santiago Santi Casorli (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
In the team with less than 30 field goals, there's Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morales has only four games, and Horde Alba has two, and Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not made their debut yet.
Spain's leading scorer David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the leading scorer, twice as many points as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to give one of their best shows next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says it's also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
That's what bassist and founder Jeff Ament said, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on tour in South America to celebrate their 20th anniversary and will make their only stop in Central America on Sunday, November 20.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium beginning at 7:30 p.m. with the Los Angeles-based band The X and the local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from a conversation that's fully decrypted online at The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far, everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there's some loyalty to the band; the fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it like the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've done in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that's got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, and in terms of those two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surf wave?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarind, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, which are great places to surf, and that's how we learned about it from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can tell you've done some great shows with a lot of songs.
What are your plans for the show in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to make the best show possible with the most diverse songs; we're going to try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a wide variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How's that work?
I think part of it's because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour is your 20th career anniversary.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I don't think either of us could ever have imagined that we'd be in a rock band and that doing it for over 20 years makes it a dream.
We're happy with our success and we're very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love making music.
We're happy to travel to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
We're having a very good time.
What does it mean to you to be a big part of the grass?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
Occasionally, there's one group from the same city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're happy to be friends with them all and we're honored to be part of the Seattle sound that worked.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stay together and in the same lineup for so long.
Yeah, the four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a lot longer than most bands do.
First, I think we're lucky to be alive, and second, we care about others.
We're all very close friends, and that's what's also opened up musical pathways that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been any better.
Your attitude to the word fame was not easy, but thanks to your success, you could do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew older, it became easier to find balance.
We're making sure we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to get into this game with a lot of people and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, not by choosing to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and didn't release an album until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of disappointment because it went on for so long, and most importantly, we're still close friends with Bruce (Fairwester) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think about the incredible person Andy was, and the way he made me laugh, it was always the pleasure of going to work, laughing, talking about music and football and so much more.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the producers sent us a couple of videos, and this was the band we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas have to offer live, and it's got to be really exciting.
Why do you always change the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
The first to come to mind are Geiser Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovsky...
There are so many of them, I can talk all day about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge alive even though it's out of fashion?
I think we all feel a little bit separated from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all of the other bands that came out around the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's great because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better than ever.
At first your music was darker, but now it's more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, even though they may sound a little positive.
Both of those songs when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, and those songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and you've had some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, those events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that to me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former president Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a state hospital for a loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four operations and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginag, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fuchimori would be examined for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aginagami said that he thought Fuhimori should be a candidate for the graces of mercy for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want to do so because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations for tongue cancer, lost 18 pounds, and other ailments, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and problems with blood circulation in his legs, the doctor said.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for killing 25 people by the forces of an army of destruction that operated in secret during his first years in power.
Mujica goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important point of a comprehensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguay leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will be "a favorable opportunity for the exchange of information on the political relations between the two nations", the South American country's leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking support from Calderon for Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked protests from Uruguay and a recall for consultations with his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairman of the G20 since November, a group of the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax swaps to leave the Organization's "grey list" of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which increased trade between the two countries.
The water pipe will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil paws of Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for a girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The release, which will be available in stores worldwide this month, was created with the Nintendo 3DS's portable console features in mind, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is a hero who should tell you how to use a lensless stereoscopy", said Omar Alvarez, head of Nintendo's press service in Spain, during the game's presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform", because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that despite its existence in 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once you start, most experts will go "round two" to levels that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects depth of action, but that requires playing in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not give in to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which hasn't happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo blinks with fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a moustache plumber must pass through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.

Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo had begun so that he could answer in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This ends the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from the northern country that had demanded the extradition of Portillo to be tried there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he had not "put his hands on" legal decisions and had taken all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did shows the executive process after all the legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of squandering Q120 million at the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process leading to his extradition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The results of Trinijove's first 25 years of social support are important: 6,000 young people who have been socially isolated have helped them overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
Add to this the more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the closing ceremony, held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was born near Trinity Vella in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work, and drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration at Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been working with the association for the past 25 years.
Different political views during the election showed the unified nature of Trinijove's work.
After the General Council Chairman, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor, Horde Pukhol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education consultant, Ernest Maragal, and former lieutenant mayor and current eco-socialist, municipal council member, Rickard Goma.
Also appearing at Fabra I Coats is current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris and CEO of social work La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove came into being at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and to instill hope in people who are experiencing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work it has done", he said.
The seized building where mass parties were held has been evacuated
The hijackers have occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building at 51 Balmes Street.
12 occupants left the building yesterday at noon without a fight .
It seems the nightmare of the neighbors living at 51 Balmes Street is over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied yesterday at noon, where they were holding mass parties that irritated neighbors, according to court orders without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat.
"From now on, there will be a pass control", said the manager.
The squatters who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the people, appropriated all the electricity and some of the water, painted the walls and left traces of all kinds, especially the alcohol tanks.
The first three floors were the site of mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her income had fallen by 80% since the building was occupied.
The owner of the club says that the building's occupants dragged her into an unfair competition, because they sold drinks for three euros, while the club sold them for 10.
In addition, the owner of the disco was to respond to neighbors' complaints about noise, although she noted that the noise was not caused by the club's visitors, but by the residents of the club and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were held there, whose frequency and intensity increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now, he has "forgiven" her rent.
City police also confirmed that they have received more complaints from neighbors over the past few weeks.
PP's municipal group chairman, councillor Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week "immediate evacuation of the building to address the problems of coexistence and common sense that have emerged among the neighbors and the degradation in the area".
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them have been broken into.
In this sense, he added, "we must put an end to impunity and stand firm against the culturelessness that is taking place in the building".
So, yesterday, the police evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 3:30 PM, police went to 35th Street in Montreal after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the competition after a dispute over the contributions
The municipal competition for 16 doors resumed debates on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCC), this administration printed promotional leaflets for the Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as the great park of the capital Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a picture comparison with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took its place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is oriented not to the north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
Positioning the Colserola as a nature park contradicts this idea.
The prototype wasn't Central Park, it was Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 contests for many other gates in Colserolo.
The idea of a park is obviously a gate.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, is it a roller coaster, a park or a mountain?
The competition, its organizational side and its impact on the city, is a topic for discussion among all Barcelona architects.
It's hardly the most frequent topic discussed when two members of this elite clan meet in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects and the scientists who were present said.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldán, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, the mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"You have to admit that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
And most of all, it's because of its excellent accessibility.
The Colserola is more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Collserola Gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as a park entrance, but as a restriction of certain areas where we should act".
The model, like Roldán and Bayonne with experience in urban planning, called the proposal an "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
The risks arising from the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum's platform with "its own swan song".
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries that can be built.
"Limiting something is preparing for the next step", is the transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools because the current ones [as far as the General Capital Plan (GCP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble".
More specifically, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Val Colserola "can be understood as a park, not Barcelona" as a purely topographical matter.
Modolo recalls that there is already work being done outside of Calcerola, which "should not be missed", although he is grateful for the opportunity the municipality offers his professions to join this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he claims) that were supposed to create: "Architects should only be a tool".
Byona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, since the rules of the competition lack a common type of Colserola: "There have been 16 cross-contestations, he says, in the sense of a sea-mountain, but there is no long reading to see and understand the region as a whole".
That makes him decide to take part in at least 16 contests.
On the other hand, a project for one gate may intersect by program and definition with an architect's project for the neighboring gate.
In your view, the council is obliged to ensure that the strip directly above the Ronde de Dalt should provide a fully equipped area for a smooth transition between the city and the green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasbal and he's released.
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino's attorney pardoned the mayor's brother in a lawsuit against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrassabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is prosecuting the extortion case against the mayor's brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos allegedly asking Manuel Jonas to pay an economic contribution so that the authorities of Monterrey would allow a secret operation at the casino.
After a public conviction, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison.
After four hours before an agent of the State Department of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the instructions of the second order banning movement after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Kaderait for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a medium degree of inmate isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his sentence in the municipal prison of San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the Second Criminal District Court clerk, Jorge Janez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation, the evidence of Jonas' guilt was pretty obvious, such as charging 1.5 million pesos from the bookmakers in exchange for permission to operate.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for a pardon for the mayor's brother so he could be released in the following hours.
During the trial, the state prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated for the damage and which of the gambling house partners was granting the amnesty, although the lawyer tried not to say the name.
Based on the 197/2011 record, Jonas Larrasbal was granted a legal amnesty, and thereafter no claims can be made regarding the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrassabal Breton immediately.
The court clerk, Jorge Janez, went to the San Nicolas Municipal Jail in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dioniscio Pérez Hacome tells us about the details of the disaster, where Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MoT) said that results from the accident that killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others showed that the helicopter hit the ground in full integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionicio Pérez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft was taken up, the pilot had found out that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that appear to indicate the ship had several contact with the ground, wings coming into contact with trees at 25 metres, where the device lost its fuselage".
He also said the ship was intended for 19 people, and that it was in compliance with the requirements for transporting people.
He also said that the research conducted in the impact area did not report any parts on the ground.
"The investigation reports that no other ship components were found, the impact occurred in a structural state.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements for passenger transportation.
The earth at this point has a tilt of seven to 30 degrees.
The secretary said that the key is to get results as soon as possible, but the research could take months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Guilbert Lopez Meyer, director general of Airports and Relief Services, said that the presidential helicopter was operating at cruising speed at the time of the crash and that it happened on soft, rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a conventional flight maneuver at the time of the strike", he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Pérez Hakome listed six key elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and landing.
The weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for takeoff when the aircraft headed for the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where layers of clouds were observed at low altitudes.
The selected routes:
It's possible that the cloud conditions caused the team to search for a lower elevation and greater visibility area in the Cuernavaca Valley.
The hit point.
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the aircraft are consistent, probably without loss of control or change of flight direction before the impact.
The scattered debris on a small area:
The information available to date indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The scattered debris suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under the conditions of structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion:
There's still evidence of a shipwreck, some kind of explosion or fire in the crash zone.
Recent research suggests that there may have been multiple earth contacts.
During the work, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a tilt of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to suggest that the helicopter may have had several crashes.
After careful scrutiny of a larger area than the outlined area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces a gene search program for obesity
Social protection leads the research on finding the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it is conducting a study to detect an obesity gene in children and young people, which is called the Protocol on the Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity, which will provide a count of signs associated with being overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Biochemistry Medical Research Unit at the National Medical Center's Specialized Hospital of the XXI Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and postdoctoral fellows of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invites the public (prescribed or not) to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children will be conducted every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started at the sports center in Kwautemok (to the west of the state of Mexico), and from October 8 the events are held at the sports center in Nesawalkootla (to the east of the state of Mexico).
Once the goal of involving 500 to 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (south of Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify the risk factor among children and young Mexicans for preventing chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14 and the main goal is to gather 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years with the permission and supervision of their parents to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of inherited diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be conducted.
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects health care professionals' concern about the alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that there was an increase in just 6 years: 77 percent of boys were obese, 47 percent of girls were obese; and there was a significant increase in overweight", said an MSSI specialist.
He said the validity of the marker search is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from other nations in their genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican is 65 percent of American Indian descent, 30 percent of European and five percent of African descent, and this condition was influenced by genes that are linked to diabetes and being overweight.
He explained that the main effect of obesity genetics is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and then store it as fat.
The researcher explained that a direct benefit to participants is a comprehensive assessment of children that can determine whether they are at least in some degree overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck and forearms means a chance of metabolic impairment and even pre-diabetes.
The information is treated with all confidentiality, and the doctors pass it on in writing to the parents, who they explain to all the measures and lifestyle changes that must be taken to avoid disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the television, and using transportation for short distances instead of walking.
It's also due to high calorie intake, which is increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tams, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Errera, a researcher at the UNAM School of Chemistry, developed polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the highest quality, environmentally and temperature resistant.
If the signals sent by the road cover were to be taken into account, about 200,000 pits would need to be repaired each rainy season in the downtown area of Mexico City's Valley, says Rafael Errera Naher, a researcher at UNAM's Chemical Faculty, adding that if the process of building and maintaining the asphalt road cover is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, Technological Look at the Pit, read as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, like in some cities in the north, to improve road quality and thus counteract the formation of pits.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscous behavior.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees, it's very viscous, and at 50 degrees Celsius, it's almost solid, while at very low temperatures, bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but varies throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperatures, said a chemical engineer.
A chimpanzee noted that Mexico's streets are mostly covered with flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Between the top layers is bitumen, made of small stones that are lowered into bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is submerged in bitumen.
When vehicles are moving and exercising their efforts, this helps the forces to be very well distributed along the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, it would have distributed even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt surface, he added, is the last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also submerged in asphalt.
Since this is the layer that will come into contact with the wheels of the vehicle, it should have more resistance than the asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute this effort, the wear layer also requires the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the state of the asphalt.
When the soil is raw, water penetrates the coating and it is difficult for it to get out of it, it causes all the layers of the coating to soften and hence the formation of a pit.
When the pits are formed, he said, the wear layer is first worn out and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, a process that should be taken into account at the first sign of current repair programs.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transportation loads are another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be related to transportation loads and this requirement must be guaranteed to be met to prevent frequent occurrence of holes.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to be studied and done about bitumen, such as bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to repair wells with ease and without using high temperatures.
What did a candidate from Vallee miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Meline Ramirez from being crowned Miss Colombia.
The representative of Vallee has won the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valerie del Caucus was left with only the desire to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for getting on the podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the sceptre, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Caucus who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borre Dominguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Marie Alsaté (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romé (1993), Al Jace Hissé (2000), Al Jace Hissé (2000), Al Jace Gareth (2000), and Al Jace Gareth (2008).
The question that many people ask now is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in every single one of her performances has shown that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just that she was chosen by the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Face by Vogue - titles that the Queen, for example, held, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?", asked by Martin Murillo Gomes of the Let's Read Society.
She said to the man who asked her:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of occultism, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood  "The Little Prince" is a pretty deep book.
Today I'm reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I'm also currently reading Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called Blood Heat.
The answer, which the jury disliked because of the term "culturation" and, second, because it didn't explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterized it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what happens is what should happen".
And all of you, please read a little bit. "The Little Prince" is a great book".
Among the hypotheses raised, Valerie burned from favorites.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that as she was favored, she was met with applause, and she was the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (the Oster's culinary competition, the audience vote for best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, provoked stress in the queen, and as a result she did not shine on stage".
And it was marked during her first swimming pool appearance at Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was obvious that she lacked the strength and energy that the Magdalen and Atlantic representatives showed.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN's "Like Home", said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not become a queen".
Also, the representative of Valerie has been avoiding communication with the press lately, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valerie failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we must look not only at the looks, but also focus on the public consciousness, before they enter the contest, they must already be involved in the projects", she said.
There is also speculation that Valerie was guilty of vaginal defects and fibrosis that was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury has noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
King Jorge's adviser, Hernan Orozco, notes that Melina had no better body than she had, "but the problems of fibrosis in her stomach, which I did not notice, caused her to lose her glasses on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of the Kromos magazine believes that the Valerie de Caucus's mistake was that she had surgery.
"Operations are good, but the representative of Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a vicious prediction came true last night, saying it was the uncle that Raymond gave to Melina as compensation for losing the pleasure of getting the crown.
Whether it is or not, the fact is that today is Melina's first year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions directly indicated by the National Contest organizers.
However, she will go down in history as one of the kings who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena contest, faced difficulties in getting the crown.
That was the job of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
The Kali criminal entered history as the man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI criminalist Kali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Of the seven forensic investigators working at CTI, it's time this week to "defray" Elízar Gonzalez, a Puerto Texan who has spent 21 years in the field of criminal investigations.
Early in his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel for more than five days through the jungle to reach places where bodies had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valletta and after completing his corresponding courses, he became a specialist in criminology, where he studied the friction of the skin, i.e. the hands and feet.
During the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great is coming.
He arrived on a helicopter from Kauka to Palmyra on Friday night.
He knew he would need to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of the prints of Guillermo León Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with a research team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, shovel, and a flashlight, Eleazar compared the body's fingerprints to those in the photographs.
His eyes were not disappointed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a representative from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSC.
Fingerprinting
For the cali-based tactile imaging specialist of Sijin, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos, Eliezer González, at a press conference on the Kano operation is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without errors, and it can play a key role in crime detection.
In addition to identifying bodies, tactile scanners are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and identify the detainees.
Many of the criminals who are arrested have fake IDs or no documents.
We'll take their prints and search the database.
The investigator said that in the event of a theft, he had to take a piece of the wall home because the thief was there, leaning on his hands to seize a safe full of jewels and money.
"Walls are hard to work with because they are not comfortable surfaces to take prints from, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole hand and identify the criminal who was involved in several robberies", he says.
The prints also help to rule out or establish the involvement of suspects in murder-related cases.
A dead man was recently found with liquor bottles around him.
The investigation revealed that a relative may have been a suspect in the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle actually matched.
While it doesn't guarantee he was the killer, it does prove he was at the scene.
A tactile imaging specialist at CTI explained that where there are prints, a chemical or physical reagent is applied.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the database of the offenders, or entered into the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians", said a CTI expert.
He explained that things weren't as they were on the CSI show.
Just as not all the glittering gold, not everything you touch, leaves its mark.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry people challenging the New York City authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke up a camp outside Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court ruling to evict the demonstration from the square and headed to the neighboring park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under a court order, Manhattan Square, from where they were evacuated at dawn to attempt to seize another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to because of a court order that allowed "angry people" to break up camp in the square, while the rest of the movement responded to the dispersal by seizing a park north of the city where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal fight for our return to Zuccotti through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a member of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the "angry people"'s response to the tent town evacuation, ordered personally by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a ruling banning forced evacuation from the square and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, "angry people" began to seize a new park at the intersection of Central Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the Trinity Church parish property.
They could have occupied the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not give the exact number, but told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization claims that several hundred people were standing in tents at the location where a delegation of religious leaders had gone to show support for members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to consider the legality of today's morning protest.
Some of the protesters who were heading there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave copies to police guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes", said Bray, who said some police beat the protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to evacuate members of the "Seek Wall Street" movement and force enforcement of "laws that were issued after the seizure began, or to prevent protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other property previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city suspended the public space and the protesters were informed, but local laws prevent them from opening tent shops and sleeping bags again.
A municipal council member personally justified the operation of removing protesters from Zuccotti Square at dawn, during which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the square to be cleared because it became "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses were threatened" and neighbors feared "a deterioration in quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers", added a spokesman for the movement, who condemns the mayor for "disrespecting free speech".
Those responsible for "Hang Wall Street" also indicated that they intend to organize "great rallies" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program Russell Peters' Christmas on December 1.
Pamela Anderson, a Canadian, was Tim Allen's assistant in "Big Repair", a lifeguard in "Malibu Saviors", Bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1 Russell Peters Christmas television program as a very special Maria.
CTV today unveiled footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for her internet-broadcast home pornography video, is featured alongside her then-husband, drummer Tommy Lee of the Mötley Crüe, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently performed as the host of Charlie Sheen's "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luciana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March and who also knows the meaning of the scandal.
Buble recently called Kim Kardashian a "dirty" American during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Rebuilt After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the downturn that began in March.
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and still recovers from the devastating earthquake that led to the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the rising sun country has suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo government estimates the loss of property at $300 million, a blow that, despite the dire global situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive quarter losses, the July-September GDP data definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew 1.5% year-on-year and 6% year-on-year.
The second quarter, for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012, also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machine tools to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1 percent versus a 0.9 percent decline in capital expenditures from January to March, the first decline after six months of steady growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian momentum, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, largely through the development of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This figure increased by 1% as the cost of cars, travel and leisure increased.
The mark of the yen
Tokyo gave the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the "currencies of refuge" chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and the negative outlook for the United States, a privilege that would push like a stone against the accounts of exporting companies.
In a stronger currency, the cost of goods abroad is high, a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of big tech companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Esikiko Node is not slowing down.
We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Minister of Economic Policy Motokhisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And the prospects aren't really exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of declining economic activity in September.
The indicator that predicts the breakdowns in the global economy has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the 100-point average after falling eight-tenths to 99.13.
Athens is giving way to doubt again
Papadimos said the amendment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written terms.
With peripheral rewards for risk and uncertainty looming in parks, Greece continues to wander the maze leading to a break from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new transitional government of Elda is more a result of Brussels' demands than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon at his appointment could be insufficient to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and repeated his demand for new elections scheduled for February 19.
The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on October 26, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be crowned tomorrow by a vote of confidence in the new executive.
The 24 employment programmes, the reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clear his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything".
The Conservative leader has taken a step further in his sentiments towards the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the treaty's requirements.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of the Papandreou-style all-or-nothing referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands were unambiguous: it would not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece's main parties sign "a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeo Altafay said that the trio's inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what needs to be done to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
The Greek cabbage will have enough yarns for a while.
Mrs. Sophia: "These are tools of progress and hope".
The Queen stressed Spain's "core" place in this type of finance
Spain "has become a world leader in microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor of cooperation tools, whose "essence", she said, is that it is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on faith in people".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit yesterday in Valladolid, with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such action is "absolutely necessary" to meet the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "especially with the goal of doubling the number of people living on less than a dollar a day - the level at which the "poverty line" is recorded.
Spain "is still working" to expand its global network of recipients and is taking on this task with all "responsibility", says Dona Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main recipients of these loans".
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face".
The microcredit summit is not only a platform for debate but also a platform that promotes "two main goals".
So Her Majesty explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will be lifted out of the poverty they are in.
The impetus for creating a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "went the way it was started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as an "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the instrument's father as "an outstanding idealist in the overall fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I saw continuous development", said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project gave her the title of "head of the family" collected in Valladolid as "the banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sophia concluded her speech by urging those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
The ethical imperative.
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez concluded that microcredit is a "serious and firm course toward poverty eradication", and that now "more than ever" developed governments must work on the basis of solidarity and not allow it to become a victim of spending cuts.
For Spain, micro-credit is "one of the main areas of development cooperation".
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" in giving "confidence" to the "separated people, before whom all doors are closed", and Mayor Francisco Javier Leon de la Rivas welcomed all those present in the city, which "opens its doors with a spirit of solidarity".
The Court of Justice proposes to elect the chairman of the European Commission by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also chair of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was born in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government's policies are far from as strict as they should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, put to the attention of the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted for several minutes, and which were earned by the speeches of Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schöuble, the Eurofill and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's main idea and draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: "The right answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "it's time to break through in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible for the European Union to strengthen its control over the financial policies of the euro area countries, but it could also affect the European Commission's election of the president by universal suffrage "to give Europe a face".
In any case, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution passed by Congress, the idea of which apparently belongs to Wolfgang Schöuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that 27 countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK is against it, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the European Central Bank board according to the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
To calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who like to criticize "high-minded" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted an entire paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is hospital card fraud?
Following the cash benefits, the UMP and the government began an assault on hospital records.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Fund and deliver a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on combating social benefits fraud.
And to help this offensive, which was born out of a desire to save money in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing presidential re-election campaign, most want to focus on hospital sheets.
First of all, with budget savings in mind, the government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private company employees before the start of benefits.
Obviously, without the employer's specific consent, a sick worker will lose a salary in four days equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A move that threatens to create a storm of anger, but which Les Echos say will save 280 million euros.
This will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely imposing one day of sickness benefit on public servants (public servants have not yet had to wait for benefits, unlike the three-day wait for private sector employees).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most are also raising the issue of fraud, with the implication of abuse of hospital records.
Control will be stricter and if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have received illegally", Xavier Bertran warned on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat out of proportion to actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, since 2002, they have been subject to constant surveillance and political attacks that have been fruitful.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the numbers by country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation expenditures of 11.3 billion euros in 2008 accounted for 5% of total health expenditures.
Of this amount, 46% was for leave and accidents at work and 54% for sickness benefits, amounting to 6.2 thousand million euros.
And so it was 2.5% of health-related spending.
French people spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic mean, which hides some discrepancies; another study published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of hospital care.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010, 37% of patients lived less than 8 days, 15% lived less than 15 days to one month, 15% lived longer than one to three months, and 11% lived longer.
If you compare these figures with those of our European neighbors, you can see that French workers are no more likely to take hospital leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001 the overall share of absences from work in France (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared to 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud rate associated with hospital records is very low compared to "grey" employment.
As far as the fraud rate goes, it's very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to systematic inspections of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases tested, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 conclusions about short-term illness were "unwarranted" or too long", making 37,050 cases.
In cases where hospital records were systematically checked for more than 45 days, 11 percent of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", or 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were "unfounded" for the millions of workers who received hospital records.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, say, the gray employment figures.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiana, author of a report on the issue in June, they represent between 9 and 15 thousand million euros of unreceived budget revenue per year, which is more than the total daily compensation costs, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said this on Monday, November 14, in parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to accomplish this task.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", the head of government said, making his first public statement, opening a debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone is "put on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rightists reject the new government
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said in a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the deficit reduction and debt reduction and the fight against the losses, but also his rejection of any course that would hinder the recovery of the economy.
Olly René, the European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary 8 billion euro loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and self-harm must be legalized, says the expert committee
Canadians are denied death, the Royal Society of Canada report says.
As for palliative medicine, the committee says that the government, healthcare institutions and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care possible, excluding cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps toward that.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the government amend the criminal code to allow for assisted suicide and euthanasia where circumstances impose the choice and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent study by the Economic and Financial Crimes Bureau that compared the mortality rate in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "medicalisation of death in Canada has given rise to a culture where people are afraid to argue about death".
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report concludes that it contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that decriminalization involves abuse in application, i.e. euthanasia or third-party suicide, against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, the report's host, Joseline Downey, confirmed in a television conference that most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and third-party suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Self-help suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Joseline Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It's important to remember that 85 percent of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, they believe it will help people to ease their suffering later in life.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for people who have assisted in suicide, 41 percent of respondents believe they should not be prosecuted.
The report's authors say that the situation is less clear when it comes to extending or discontinuing medical care.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the criminal code should stipulate that terminating medical care legally is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also demands that health professionals be trained in a respectful spirit to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the Committee calls on the government, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not just for cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it is not used to numb physical pain, as euthanasia is, and subject to the same restrictions.
Other experts ' comments
Some experts in health legislation have already commented on the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's report.
Dr. Pierre Deschan, a health law expert, described the report's signatories as "extreme", because among other things, it does not limit euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 can ask for help committing suicide, says Metr Deschan, who discussed the summary of his report yesterday.
Mr. Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to put personal independence above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses "categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called the "euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, in particular, the report's findings on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and third-party suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King calls on President Assad to step down
Damascus condemns the conspiracy
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
The supporters of Bashar Assad held a demonstration yesterday outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting him and condemning the "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership in the League of Arab States was suspended, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan voted for President Assad's resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to abdicate in Syria, where about 40 more civilians and regime military personnel were killed.
"If Bashar were to be in the interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions for a new phase of political life", the king of Jordan, the country's neighbor to Syria, told the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, have not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot meet their aspirations will lose power, he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country that Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course towards.
The United States, for its part, welcomes the "expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough course against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's armed forces have been killed in the Deray area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reports.
Two other residents were killed in a shootout and heavy machine gun shelling in the besieged town of Homs in the Jobar area, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country was nearing the end of the crisis".
He also reacted sharply to the Arab League's decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that the plot against Syria will fail".
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying "the mechanism of protection of civilians and is demanding the entry into the country of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he said had fallen into "panopoly".
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis plan adopted on November 2 that includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the fighting cities and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty needs time at the markets and sacrifices from the Italians.
Italy's future head of government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a program that would require "sacrifices" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner was in a political party discussion yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He'll have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who don't belong in parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of a program that involves many sacrifices, said Francesco Nucarra, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the prime minister candidate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monte presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
"In a democracy, it takes time to prepare the government and the program", he said, adding that he was confident that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns were raised again, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should be in place until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that, having assumed office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important player in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not meet its 2013 budget despite a tough austerity plan adopted in recent months, demanded in particular new tough measures.
Italian "boss boss" Emma Marchaglia, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy "because a country that doesn't have growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as a European commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "era change" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconianism", a "professor" symbolizing "a challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the novels.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid a snap election, as Italy must pay 200 thousand million euros in public debt by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a US agency specializing in nuclear hazards confirmed Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern over the "possible military aspect" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "starting in the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosion methods".
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to create a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
Financial difficulties in his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA mentions "clear signs that Iran's development of a nuclear detonator system" was "promoted by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well but who also told the agency that he had worked on it for most of his career as part of his country's military nuclear program".
Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published Monday, anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of Muslim violence cases increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equivalent to a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in Catholic violence, a 4% reduction in attacks on Jews and a 14% increase in religious crime.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of these crimes is rising again, Human Rights First says, "the increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant", the organization adds in an official statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crime, should be treated as serious human rights violations", added one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legend.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes", he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.
"Hate crimes" in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights era.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, nationality, and modern-day sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming Facebook-like.
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to its platform presentation that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes the service similar to Facebook.
The new activity tab and other name tabs make it easier and more direct to track the activity of other tweets, the internet users whose posts ("tweets") you track and those who track yours.
It gives you the ability to know if they're posting, if they're signing up for new accounts, if they're getting selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before it went live on the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Caroline Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known for being intuitively rather vague and using rather vague terms (RT for someone else's temptation, #followfriday for recommendation to track other users), mainly to bring pleasure to experienced users, is thus opening itself up to a wider audience, introducing users to something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
Users on the Internet discussed the innovation through online tweets.
"It's useless, it's obsessional and it's too much like Facebook".
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed, @dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria
The introduction of the budget "golden rule" into the constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by the rating agencies of Austria's state credit rating (triple A).
Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faimann personally announced the decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with the Austrian government debt at 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60%, set by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the government debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's solvency had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three thousand million euros more interest each year, the Christian Democrat vice chancellor and foreign minister Michael Spindellegger argued.
Austria is thus fulfilling the demand of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of state and government have demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian government's decision resembles a "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and the lands, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to get the public debt below the 60% mark, as enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, by 2020/2021.
Yeshico Noda
threatens new intervention on the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
We intervene as we did last time, considering the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Node explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to the historic mark that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On this day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, fueled by purchases from investors who see it as a haven in these turbulent times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The rise in Japanese currency is damaging Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the revenue of Japanese firms from abroad when converting to national currency.
"Japan is fighting to recover itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), stressed Mr. Nod, who fears that this rise in yen will kill the fragile seed of recovery.
The world's third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 percent - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of disaster-hit households.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect "Japan's fundamental economic performance".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps", making clear that no further easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand million euros), raising the ceiling to 55,000 thousand million yen (519 thousand million euros) of the sums it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
The euro area
The stock market is fluctuating.
The risk of debt crisis is undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges have moved a little further into the negative zone this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10am, CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at 3,064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
As the eurozone countries are struggling to pay their loans, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent gains.
"Fearful investors are just too worried about the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed down 0.7% on the back of new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its gaze to Europe, and exchanges will follow each other along the narrow corridor of change until investors have proof that the situation has stabilized", says Mitsusige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone is beating the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, falling 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party congress on Monday, which passed a resolution providing, in particular, for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are substantially higher than 6%
The rates of credit in Italy and Spain remain high, raising concerns.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These interest rate difficulties in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which was in danger of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 would be his government's "main task".
Spain was under attack from markets ahead of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The gap between interest rates on 10-year German and Spanish debt has reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter figures to a decrease, with a fall of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m. with the European Commission warning of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there's a topic that you can't decide after a short discussion or emotionally, it's energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It's a healthy trend that election meetings are an opportunity to reflect on the role and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not be settled until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We have seven billion people on the planet now, and the demographic development will double our electricity needs by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world's population is deprived of vital resources.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing fossil-fuel shortage to continue producing electricity continuously, while not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalance, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima disaster doesn't change any of these factors.
That's why Germany is alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which has decided to find a source that can replace nuclear power, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are firmly pursuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one installation to its suite after Fukushima, resuming construction of the station, which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although Germany's renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a surge in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
We should consider the example of Denmark.
It is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the winds that break; therefore, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our consistent energy policy, our neighbors are paying 40% more for electricity than French households.
In a globalized economy, energy prices are a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, and French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in electricity prices, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of our purchasing power.
The price most French people refuse to pay, especially because they don't object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole host of small and medium-sized enterprises specialized in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear power, it would have to donate a large number of these plants and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to last sixty years if the plant was scheduled to close?
To solve the energy equation, we must recognize that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centers like Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are filled with the same obsession with safety.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has been through three major incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was operated under normal conditions, but without any human or environmental impact.
In Chernobyl, the reactor's design and an unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented strength that killed tens of thousands.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, just as it did from the two previous ones.
The result of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that allows us to counter such phenomena.
As it is being considered by all energy professionals who want to build a reactor, the plant's completion in Flamanville will be a great gift to Areva and EDF competitors, paving the way for them to become leaders in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial well-being of our country.
Is Immigration a Burden or a Good for the Economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by various parties - overloading police, judicial and administrative services, subservient to the policy of numbers, and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative oppression of foreign students, which got in the news when the minister of the interior (Libération, May 23) declared that France "did not need foreign talent, stoneworkers and waiters".
But it's rarely analyzed from an economic standpoint.
The right and left are largely in agreement on this issue.
On the right side, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accept the poor from all over the world".
The difference is only in the level of generosity
In 2005, the Polish water-pipeller's horde felt fear of invasion of the country by both the left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they're willing to show to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limited himself to the trivial, saying that "working together will solve our immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it's very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Foreign People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Shape Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.
Limiting immigration leads to slower growth and lower employment.
The fear of immigrant influence is based on the idea that they can replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, causing a decline in wages.
But experience shows that immigrants actually supplement local labor force far more than they replace it with jobs that lack local labor force.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, while the most skilled work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants has led to the influx of immigrants having a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Perry estimated that a 1% increase in the migration flow would lead to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And that's without considering the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring in contributes to new ideas and economic growth (among the Nobel Prize winners in America, the number of naturalized immigrants is high, and Google, Intel, Paypal, and Yahoo - all of them were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net income to the social security system, contributing on average 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates that, for example, an immigrant arriving in Germany at the age of 30, will bring a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of 150,000 euros to the state budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, was going to "tooth" to cling to the missing growth points.
The teeth that were used to scare off immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it remains to be understood European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally conquer its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as straightforward as possible.
It's been known since the time of Napoleon the Younger that this is the surface of thought.
General voting, although a mandatory condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of repression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Washro once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation of powers and control, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but first of all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have a double-disclosure effect, demonstrating both the need for a major policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to be overcome.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has now shifted and many believe that Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We won't win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic order.
A card-blush for an absolute European monarch or a leg-bound leap into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of a guillotine blade, but of a common, clear and continuous choice and democracy, this time at a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it's not clear how many more will have to be listed, because there's only one crisis - the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project must be restored to the sovereignty of the people.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the burden of debt, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The crisis will require solutions at a European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After much discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jack DeLore are now demanding a European economic government.
Let it be.
But to imagine it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which has been brought into existence by citizens, is another madness and a new deadlock.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, you had to "create" the Republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains in effect.
We must build a Europe that is economically united.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European sovereignty of the people.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are becoming more and more widespread.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Vilpente, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transportation or purchases by simply holding a card over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chips will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and will account for almost 10% of the global chip-card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France is starting from a more modest position: 400,000 Visa contactless cards are in circulation.
But the big stores are moving faster.
This year, Carrefour has released 2.5 million MasterCard contactless passes.
To move to higher speeds, banks need to supply their customers with equipment.
"Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", said Gerard Neboui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments with their mobile phones.
But this is just the first stage of the future of payment, which is mobile phones.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC technology, which is necessary to perform such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they really should be flying off next year".
"We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012", explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that it would conduct an experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 customers and employees will be equipped with contactless payment chips.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch a market offering that would allow its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist front spreads from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb's ties to Boko Haram.
The long-held links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians are now confident.
"The methods used by these two organizations and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating", he explained, without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January revealed two links.
Abducted from a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocorte and Vensane Delory were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to terrorists among the debris left behind.
The axis of terror
Analysis of the calls revealed several interlocutors who were in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a nigerian who lived for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other - a man allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about the operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active", says Kunle Amwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent in Boko Haram's actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressuring Abuja to bring attention to the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who have no interest.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri, at a mosque, school and with imam-fundamentalist Muhammad Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "western education is sin" for the hausa - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has enjoyed rapid success.
It is politicised and strictly requires strict observance of Sharia law, and its activists have begun a struggle against the wicked central government.
It's targeted primarily at churches, bars and government agencies.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police departments.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern heritage.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jose and then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram organized the first fatal attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the United Nations' local mission will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is a concern for all security experts now.
Today, with Aqmi consolidated in Mali and Niger and Somalia's al-Shabaab allies operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Allen Juppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed willingness to share all available information.
The world as Republican presidential candidates see it
With regard to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world with simple, or rather, simplified ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe that.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been making loud but lacking detail foreign policy statements that have traditionally been a Republican strength.
The slogans of China, Iran and aid to Israel are often confused.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated for the "Old Good Party", threatened to sue the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency - a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
The worse it will be if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a deep understanding of foreign policy, failed to resist a position that was emotionally compelling.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who's at the bottom of the ratings, is still unheard of.
In Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran", he announced.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of breaking his promises to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the candidates' list, has shown a disheartening lack of knowledge.
He recently called for a counter to the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power, apparently without knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and is keen to launch military strikes on Iran, says he is ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture for terrorism suspects, which Obama banned in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All of this is a far cry from the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain, the heavyweight foreign policy maker.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas too and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to tone down the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, his premature withdrawal of the rebels from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which have earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offense is not so easy.
The population considers the balance of national security positive under Obama, who eliminated bin Laden.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military interventions that get stuck in the sand.
And when he says that America needs to be rebuilt economically to regain its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, new gateway for Russian gas to Europe.
The North Stream gas pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly to the bottom of the Baltic Sea has been launched.
It's designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households with gas.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the orchestra's performance and the fine snacks, in the opening of the Northern Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rütte have all rolled the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will supply 27,5 million cubic meters of gas each year to Western Europe via the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomeranian.
The second pipeline is expected to be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 thousand million cubic meters of gas equivalent to all of France's consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, completing this huge project on time is a victory.
The project was met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin with the aim of occupying Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a rift between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of our cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically", said François Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the importance of large gas contracts both politically and economically.
All this explains the large smiles on the faces of Gazprom's heads who were present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel, sealed in concrete to protect it from anchorage.
It's on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, you had to bypass the minefields left over from World War II.
"The water was removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Mueller, a spokesman for North Stream.
Many steps were also needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metallic snake weighing the equivalent of 242 Eiffel Towers, with no gaps along its entire length, no valves and no service stations.
A control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it because Sweden was not happy that a Russian state-owned company would settle permanently on its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we'll shut down the gas in less than a minute", says Jens Mueller.
So, in the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will go into the air.
But that seems unlikely to the designers who designed seams designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
The control of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-shaped device is inserted into a 1 meter diameter pipeline and pushed forward by the gas stream.
When he arrives after three full days of traveling at a speed of three meters per second, he gives accurate information about any metal deformation.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any repairs.
The gas circulates only at its pressure.
It's 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called North Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the gas pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Then Gazprom leased this company for 20 years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported", says Jens Mueller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez's investment will be about $240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident they'll pay their bills because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
The 4.5 meter high vents form the exhaust gas terminal.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it'll be 3 million an hour, and in 2012, it'll be 6 million.
Moleskine branded notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring the taste back to writing.
He has the scent of adventure, hours spent writing in the candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its rectangular black cover, rubber, yellowish-white pages, as if they'd turned yellow over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, has decided to launch design notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took over the responsibility for launching the new product.
The note is inspired by an old production technique, moleskin, a lacquered cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
It is said that this type of notebook is highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to life today an old and forgotten thing that was a cult favorite for avant-garde artists until the 20th century", said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% to 12.7 million units.
We're a long way from the early years of production, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to identify a typical buyer because the notebook is equally attractive to businessmen, students, and freelancers.
Moleskine's buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
A small Italian company that had only 12 employees has now 100 and two offices: one in Milan and one in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, small-town department stores and has gained wide recognition.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for writing, despite the advent of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the "Round Path" exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard drawing on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags.
Success that generated envy: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which put a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Week 15 of disability employment begins today.
Despite the public charity policy that began in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still twice the average, at 19% versus 9% for the general population.
Discouraging?
"No", says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of disability employment.
"In 15 years, we've made a lot of progress".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two times higher, but three times higher".
"But there's still a lot of work to do".
I must say that there are many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them there are more elderly: 37% over 50 years old (average 17%).
They have a rather low level of qualifications: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for disabled people versus 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the core of the problem", says Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about a mentality that changes, but too slowly.
A study commissioned by the IMS-Entreprendre association in April by Cité found that the managers surveyed had a low level of knowledge about disability and "imagined themselves as solid people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally incomplete".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of having 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 law.
The latest known figures, dated 2008, give a value of 2.6%.
"Today we're about 3 percent", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization that collects taxes on companies that don't comply with the law.
Evidence: the number of "taxable" organisations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 organisations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 tax law put a lot of pressure on the company", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects the increase in awareness, particularly in large enterprises".
According to the employment ministry, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees, compared with 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What a joy"
Before they battled the Blue on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Azar and George Leikense did not hide the pleasure they had from this friendly match.
We're not going to go so far as to say that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the stage of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his striker was released in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to go further", assures Lilly.
That the contrast between his achievements at the club and in the national team is one thing, he justifies himself.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but not in Belgium".
"I have to earn my points".
Left in reserve on the eve of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in Saint-Denis to finally "glow".
Not to mention the concept of pleasure.
He's been supporting the Blue's since he was 7 years old and winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always supported them", he says.
That, of course, also reinforces the special nature of this match.
Especially the fact that on the other side are Mattie (Debush), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"Just our paths crossed".
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
LeKens kindly recalled the word "pride".
Pride to play a holiday game.
"Pride" also claims as a "neighbor" that France "has become a very high-level team again" just a year after the injury in Nice.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admired it.
Now that Belgium has missed the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in one plane with the blue leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France".
Portugal is very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento begins his match against Bosnia at 22.00 this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paul Benthu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the national team he has been at the helm of since September 2010 will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and Bosnia to beat.
With 0-0 on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it's clear the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to reach the goal that would have calmed it down.
"It's a good result, but it does involve some risk".
But at their brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be in front of a crowd that should be thrilled, although the match will be very tense", said the optimistic but sensible Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are convinced that we can win", the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Karlos Keiros' successor.
Nobody wants the Portuguese to win the game against Bosnia on Friday.
No one could have hired Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but it's a bit risky", says Bento.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merit and players who have a lot of individual merit", he added.
As already stated in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "not giving them time to think".
Good idea, if only it was realistic this time.
