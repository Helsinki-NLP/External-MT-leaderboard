We ate fried meat.
I made a big mistake.
I ate a lot this morning.
How big he is!
How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
How was your French class?
Since I couldn't afford the rent, I asked him for help.
How did Tom die?
How do I get to the zoo from here?
What did they hit you with?
What's the name of this flower?
Like an apple.
How's your family?
How beautiful you are!
I bought a sweater for the girl.
Get me a box of chocolates that I'll be happy with.
Who were you with?
Fix this.
Tell me what you found.
I counted to 200.
Counting from one to a hundred.
Tell me the story.
Tell us more.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Take good care of Tom.
Beware! Car is coming.
Take good care of him, he'll be fine soon.
Give him an elbow!
Give him a leg!
Give him a slap!
Give me the key.
Give me something to write.
Give me a pound of apples.
Give me a glass of water, please.
Let's dance to the music.
Next time, tell the truth.
The last time I saw him was at your house.
Give it a read in the article.

I gave him a tag.
Leave it there.
Leave my car alone.
I left my watch at home.
Leave me alone.
Let me see her.
Leave the books as they are.
I leave the books here.
Give me the gun.
Give me the key, please.
Give me the cup of coffee!
Where did he come from?
Where did you get the idea that I understand robotics?
Where are you from, Karen?
After breakfast we went for a walk.
What color is Tom's hair?
Whose money is this?
"Just my sister's socks"."Who are these socks from?""They're my sister's socks"."
We found out he had an accident.
Describe Tom to me.
We must study a lot.
I should keep going until I get it.
You must follow the rules.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I must hurry to class.
Ten years is really a long time.
"Tell me why you're so sad.""It's personal."
Tell me when to stop.
Tell him the truth, that's all.
Say it another way.
Tell me what you want.
Say goodbye to your friends.
Dimitri Mendeleev was born on February 8, 1834.
I'll tell my father.
He said he could, but he didn't say how.
How did they say?
They told me.
That's what I need.

It's my father's.
It's wrong to copy the classmate's lesson.
It's not true.
It's frustrating not being able to say what you mean.

She picked it up on her own.

In American movies, the black guy always dies first.
Emily wants to learn Greek.
First of all, I want you to tell me how you got there.
Which bed do you want to sleep in?
He's too old.
Fill it up, please.
I found my friend on the street.
I found a piece of paper in the room.
While some wanted new shoes, others just wanted... feet.
Teaching children is not easy.
Teaching English is your profession.

It was late, so I went home.
I brush my teeth every morning.
Write what I'm gonna say.
Write the alphabet in capital letters.
Write your last name on the fourth line.
I'm writing this on behalf of our friends who've gone.
I waited for ten minutes.

I hope I don't lose.
I hope you fall into a dit.

I forgot his name.

I'm so happy for you.
I'm at the library.
I'm nervous and excited.
I'm nervous about this.
I'm busy right now.
I'm passing my dress.
I'm ready to follow you.
I'm sitting on the table.
I'm taking a bath in the bathroom.
I study art history.
I'm studying English because I intend to go to the United States.
I just cleaned my room.
I thought you two were brothers.
I think it's time I showed you how to do it right.
I think that's what happened to Tom.

A man was hit right in front of my house. I'm alone and I don't know what to do.

A turkey is a little bigger than a chicken.
Piano
A politician like that makes me angry.
A river divides the city.
A bear wrote the story.

We go to school every day, except Sunday.
"Let's go to the funeral". "Who's the dead one?"
Let's wait here until he gets back.
Let's do what Tom says.
Let's pretend to be aliens.
I see the golden cross.
I see Dana and Corina.
Snowstorm is coming.
Come on, people!
I'm from Kyoto.
Strong winds followed the rain.

Traveling is easy these days.
I travel almost daily.
I saw her naked.
I saw the game on TV.
I saw it with my own eyes.
I saw him jump.

You opened the wrong box.
You just read the paper?

You think so?
You thought I was kidding?
Do you understand?
Do you believe in a god?
Do you add new phrases to Tatoeba?
You admitted you were wrong.
You seem to be happy today.
What did you eat?
Can you tell a Chinese from a Japanese?
Can you understand everything he says?
Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
Will you dance with me?
You must leave your room tidy.
You must be sad, since you lost one of your friends.
You must study like your sister.
You must make your parents happy.
You ought to obey your parents.
You must think long before you say yes.
You should be happy for Tom.
You should practice violin every day.
You must leave now.
You must return before dark.
You should always spend your time doing things that help your children get along in life.
You're the only person I know who's my age.
"Are you Spanish?""No, but I can speak Spanish".
You're too young to travel alone.
You're very nice.
You've found a good man.
You see the difference?
You're the tallest of all of us.
"Are you a cop?""No. Why do you ask?"
"Are you okay?" "What? Yeah, it's nothing".
You're kidding me?
Are you determined to get a tattoo?
You're at home?
You're writing and the kids are writing; they're all sitting quietly and they're writing.
Are you interested in learning German?
Are you interested in flowers?
Are you free Friday afternoon?
You're safe as long as you stay here.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
You see the star?
Do you see anything?
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Did you study yesterday?
You're a beautiful woman.
You're a bad person.

Have you ever brought your dog to this beach?
Have you ever played baseball?
You wash the dishes, Ben.
You washed everything?
You don't play with those toys anymore.
You don't give a shit, do you?
"You're not Mexican?""Yes, but I live in Argentina now".
You are not obliged to do so immediately.
You are not allowed to enter this room.
You won't like this game.
You didn't answer me.
You didn't lend it to him.
You don't have any plants or animals, right?
You don't have to do that here.
Don't you want to sit?
You don't know how tired I am of all these complaints.

Can't you speak low?
You don't know where he is.
You don't know what it's like to lose your whole family in a war.
You don't have to go dancing unless you want to.
You have nothing to fear.
You didn't come to school yesterday, did you?
Do you need our help?
Do you know him personally?
You or me?
You look like a tourist.
You think he'll like it?
You can choose any one of them.
Can you help me look for my wallet, please?
Can you tell me why you like him?
You can call me anytime.
Can you get me a clean knife, please?
Can you lend me your pen?
Can you email it?
You can sit here.
You need to change trains in Shinjuku.
You must teach me what you know.
Do you really need a car?
You have to see to believe.

Do you want to do that now?
Do you want to stay here all day?
"Do you want the green or the blue?" "It's the same thing".
You wanna go out or stay home? For me, it's so much.
"Do you want to be a millionaire?" "Who doesn't?"
"Do you want a drink?" "No, thank you. I'm driving".
Do you really want this?
Do you know who owns this car?
Do you know if Lucia can speak Japanese?
You know as well as I do that we're gonna die here.
Did you know that Julia lived in Moscow for 10 years? That's why she speaks Russian so well.
Are you still married?

You don't have to stay.
You have no proof.
You need new shoes.
You're new here?
You two know each other?
You're scared of me.
You guys are lucky.
You sell hibiscus?
Do you have any rooms available for tonight?
You have the freedom to say what you think.
You have a dog, don't you?
Are you sure you don't have enough money to buy that?

You hungry?
You have a good idea.
You have a brother, Ana?
