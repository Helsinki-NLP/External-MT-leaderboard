Members of the Welsh Assembly fear going through the marbles
There is a dismay from some Members of the Welsh Assembly (WAM) over the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Welsh Members of Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the 'Welsh Parliament'.
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them laugh.
A Labour MP stated that the group is concerned about the fact that the designation is rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means idiota and pwp means excrement.
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole was not satisfied and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP stated that the group was open-minded about the name change, but noted that the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: 'The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves.'
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which recorded widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the 'Welsh Parliament'.
On the question of the title of the MPs, the Commission voted in favour of 'Welsh Members of Parliament, or WMP, but the MWP option was more favourable in a public consultation.
Apparently, the A.M.s are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is due to present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly conducts its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of the members of the Assembly and the configuration of the committee system.
When they debate legislation, the AMs will have the final say on how they should be appointed.
The Macedonians will vote on the change of the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which includes a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has declared that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is no more than the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells are ringing at a time when the churches of Harlem are fighting for survival.
"Historically speaking, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on each corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither".
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
"People socialize differently today", he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people go regularly".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of property may not last as long as leaders expect and that sooner or later everything will return to its exact starting point".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums occupied by the kind of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so this will hasten the day when these churches will all close down, as most of those who move to these complexes are unlikely to join these congregations".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation that held its worship services in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, however, when plans were made for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners commissioned the carriageway.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the "Bells of the Poor" to the bargain.
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the main carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed St. Martin's did not replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's in the last few months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that it would seek to pass on the costs, much to the chagrin of not having been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark causes injuries to 13-year-old teenager in a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help, then rowed toward him with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel stated that he thought at first that it was just excitement about catching a lobster, but then realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I shouted out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Life-saving Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics sections backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial £2.8bn initiative to gain market share in the UK cosmetics market, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and homewares have fallen, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if successful.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand by supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would double its beauty product catalog with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket chain is also re-launching its Boutique makeup line so that most products follow vegan prescriptions, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week.
Online shopping and the shift from food shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also installed a number of Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has boosted sales of grocery products and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of health product revenue from its grocery stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-point pharmacy business three years ago to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the training of specialised colleagues who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need, and the welcoming environment and convenient locations make us an irresistible beauty point of sale that breaks with old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby quit the £11 million business
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby quit an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to brand items for the home and Truly accessories.
Their business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she would be leaving the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones livid by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became "furious" when the TV girl-of-gold admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could be worth up to £1.5 million) meant she would no longer have time to devote herself to her Truly brand of homewares and accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was boarding a plane to one of his vacation homes abroad.
One source stated: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would mean resolving their future in the long run and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely stunned.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow".
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions given the hefty investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewares, and the potential for further delays in launch.
Moreover, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we have no intention of making any comments about your business".
♪ We had a hard conversation ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
The US president jokingly mentioned the criticism he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider " unworthy of a president " and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so quickly?
Trump said in his pretended voice as "newspaper pivot".
"I gave up on nothing".
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps toward North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he said, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea", he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship".
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to rocket tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here", Trump pointed to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for channeling international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance; therefore, it becomes a bit difficult", said Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes that Indonesia has suffered, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, in bad measure the validity of a warning, contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who made improving decrepit infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, spent huge sums on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has dismissed Mr Joko's executive as he faces re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long finish for the goal of a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He hit his left before making a finish towards the second barrel.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed for the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a flying Arrizabalaga Kepa and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving as far as possible, so I was just gaining as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched it and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea were 1-0 down at halftime after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that game, the blue forward gave a back-to-back pass to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful finish that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He overtook the defenses and scored against the second-half net with a left-footed penalty passing through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said early Sunday.
There are reports that a large number of people are trapped in the building wreckage that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached a height of 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged the area's residents who may have witnessed something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images from dash cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by police that entrance and exit are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will not be able to return to their homes for more than a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
He repeatedly states that "it's so horrible".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police cars were inside the cord and another was parked in the immediate area outside.
A number of police officers have been posted inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone with information to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest monument swallowed up by the "historical revisionism" controversy
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, which recalls the perpetration by the Taliban of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on statue removal, the figure of Oliver Cromwell by the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasticity of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the 19th-century view and part of historiography of a figure many still believe to be worthy of veneration.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a champion of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely accurate description is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure of individual notoriety who represents one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honour and commemoration".
Killer pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local media reports said.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered in blood, near a well in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reports the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighborhood pit open.
In that little hole, he said, was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 pounds, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed", said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Reports claim that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig stalked a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can act as a "stimulus".
"They're just playing.
They like to peel, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the respect they deserve", he said.
Remains of the Rose hurricane are expected to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves over the colder waters of northern Mexico's coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa was causing a Category 1 hurricane, a storm about 60 miles (620 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to take shape over the Pacific Ocean that is moving toward the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rose, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the U.S.
On Monday, it will cause rainfall of up to 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rainfall could cause sudden, dangerous flooding, debris flooding and possibly landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is highly discouraged to walk in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause the canyons to turn into raging rivers and the thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy precipitation over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small debris spills and slippery roads.
This could be the first wet season rainfall in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October may see strong temperature changes throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There's a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could hit 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern part of the United States by the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the heart-wrenching testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with the stations suspending regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he's absolutely certain Kavanaugh grabbed her while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, stated that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, a figure Nielsen recorded on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the audience of those who watch programs in offices.
To give you some perspective, this is a level of audience similar to the end of an American football game or the Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day audience, Nielsen reported.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator to address a Judiciary Committee hearing.
The senator stood still looking at the floor while being criticized directly to CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told that "you have power while so many women have no power".
Flake claimed that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to have Kavanaugh's nomination go ahead for a vote in the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake claimed he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with a few other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "making politics" about Britain's future and of harming national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the front page of the paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister's "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU would charge the other side's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a Baton Rouge Police Department statement.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, news to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he shot Wayde dead with a gun.
A $350,000 bail was set, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's Office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and local residents who collaborated on the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area authorities for their "diligence and effort to get justice".
Sims was 20.
This 6-foot-1, 200-pound forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"This is what we are constantly concerned about", Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano have hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after activity resumed at the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in a 24-hour period.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in volcanic activity, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, stopped by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally crowded with tourists.
Later clashes also occurred, in which the police used sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independence groups singing "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters, who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries suffered in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region, which is inclined towards independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout to the polls was low, with a majority of those against boycotting.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we had our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out for joy because they could vote, but now we are blocked", he said.
Despite a vital but tangible victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with her mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained pending trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30pm British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings has stated that damage has occurred to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may have also shot a beast at the car.
Blood attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga 's first goal for Livingston ensured victory .
Livingston, promoted to the first division, surprised Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat of just two in 18 games as Ibrox's manager.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team is changing levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which remains without a home-field win in the top division this season, will face the Hearts leaders with eight more points next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended his streak of undefeated division clashes to six games, with head coach Holt having missed a single game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is losing chances against stunted visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead of the scoring long before the goal, because the incisive character of their game was causing Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but was dragged in front of the target and then Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's head above the target.
The home team seemed content to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing it could cause trouble for visitors at the ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free kick and Livingston got an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who hit and scored from the center of the big area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another live-ball roll of Livingston's.
There continued to be crossings to the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two large penalty claims, one after Halkett's shot at substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a hand, were rejected by the referee.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation.
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They have been exceptionally good, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers showed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown at times with Gerrard, the team fell far short of those standards.
Their final move was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is ambiguously welcomed in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of their country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters marched into the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the city, near 10:15 a.m. British summer time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and detours were set up for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Bureau of Prisons reported.
The unrest, which is still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents have been called in to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specifically trained teams were used to solve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have received wound treatment.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be reported to the police and they may spend more time behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, police intervention agents were called in to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (drought-affected areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's exactly what's predicted for early next week, when the remaining energy from the Rose hurricane crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within a 300-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation can be beneficial as the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category", reported weather.com.
First, the storm Rosa will hit the mainland through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Still strong on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, Rosa is 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 miles per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
So it is expected to hit the coastal area in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoon or at dusk on Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which raises a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora is expected, with maximum possible rainfall of 25 mm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north, passing through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression.
"The main expected danger of the Rose or its remnants is very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwestern Desert", reported the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding and flooding of life-threatening debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, near 4am British Summer Time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump claimed Kavanaugh was "a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has stated that Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally disproving an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" that day.
"A confirmation vote from Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote from one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service career", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
The president laterally referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not competing, but I am actually competing", he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican deputy told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them swept by the giant waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and causing a trail of devastation in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still on their beach activities and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the incident", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Natural Disaster Ban (BNPB) agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and downed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive fallout was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300 000 inhabitants in the area", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching to people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city's airport has only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising exponentially to over 800.
It's too bad.
While it managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of its offices, Donggala's World Vision staff have been through devastating scenes along the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's too bad.
Even as aid groups began to undertake the grim task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may only have access to the site if it is declared a 'national disaster area'.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a provincial catastrophe level", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open the doors to international assistance, but that statute doesn't exist yet".
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other inmates at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon said that within hours of news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse starting to circulate among the parachute community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu athletes who were attending the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark instead of a pair of blue ones.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during the auto cash refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The former Kanye West".
West, 41, was given the nickname Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her participation in Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
While at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, when commenting on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one", to just Ye -- being just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the military to repress the Mexican people".
Military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have risen to 300 as leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly scholarships and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
The US will have to double its funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double research spending in this area, said the investment and professional in the area Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a formal global strategy on the matter.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year: it wants to lead AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology contests like the Defense Department Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. investigators often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's the companies", he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI.
Lee pointed out that changes to immigration policies could also help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I'm of the opinion that AI PhDs should be automatically awarded green cards", he said.
The State Council of China presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the one used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests over USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not made progress in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the new name proposal, but nationalist opponents argue the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout to the polls will be enough to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price to pay to continue the admission efforts into bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters turned out to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, an electorate in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country's name, which would open the doors to its membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and putting chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the door of service", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be greater than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major disagreement in the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He sprinted between three defenses of Brighton before cutting to open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He finished one defence before neutralizing in the race more others within the boundaries of the greater Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch on the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a close on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting lead in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right on Brighton territory on that play.
He made a pass over the defense along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This one took a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second barge.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated in the finals, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the field Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the final for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these conditions?"
The Nationals haven't announced a starting pitcher for Sunday yet, but some say they're inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President later referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big...I'm not running, but I'm running and so I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all the means they need.
They don't care who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And they've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive, mean, sordid and liars".
The president referred by the name of Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and received rave reviews from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to leak?
What?
No, um, no, I, wait, one -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
He's intolerant of those who openly express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs in Parliament who have been told they are not welcome - all because we are openly expressing our views.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we expect the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today it is no longer the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'more kind and gentle' policy has long been forgotten, if ever realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political outlook began to expect me to turn around and take positions I would never agree with - be they on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on social media calling for "dismissal", denouncing the policies of the centre, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are directed to me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but never back down from them.
One of the things that most disappoint me in this era of politics is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion for censorship or change in the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I've received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that it would "do it all right" for me.
But that's not what I came to politics for.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a governor or as a minister in the government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of "dismissal" or political expedients will prevent me from acting in the way that I believe is in the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: unbeatable Ayr is on top
Two late trials somehow spoiled the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten undefeated.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the lead, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr, they manage the risks better than we do".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted test.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a large penalty before, immediately before halftime, he scored and then converted a test on the ground to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
However, Melrose got off to a good start in the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the draw to five points.
A long break followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from Maca to the outside and, after the start, Ayr reinforced the lead with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's captain in charge, Blair Macpherson, was then awarded a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted test by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure drive.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking Climo out without the ball in the penalty kick, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing moul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately following the re-start, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent wing Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth practice.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to enter the restaurant business after he was named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which is set to premiere soon, will be the series' final, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flourishing Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landlocked country, expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a sea base covered in ropes in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is a duty".
Across Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the TIJ be delivered on giant screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of their country's claim so that after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", the president voted last August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change little even if it did not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
That the TIJ's ruling was delivered only six months after the final allegations were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never waive its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must move beyond the past".
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, has said that his nation will never give up its nuclear weapons if it does not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep the promises it made at a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War would one day lead to the North's kneeling.
Washington fears it will accept the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set stunned at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's most notable piece was an extravagant yellow hat adorned with a broad feather-like plume that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-made melancholy, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-heeled.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion claim, you're in luck.
Stylist observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a nearby store.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the trail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 6-inch blade that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation to the aisles: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that carried it.
The burnt orange rag bag, adorned with rag bands and with a white leather patch, was the highlight of Jacquemus' 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big beach hats and bags hit stores next summer, and with the designer having such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for deeper study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an education sector capable of designing and implementing a tailored curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can get into his heart".
This quote reminds us well that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent exams this year, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest A grade.
These data, collected from 74 schools under the scope of SCIS, show that 72% of pupils achieved their highest A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages as an option are now viewed in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and beyond.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 concluded that 17% of the reasons for the difficulty of employers filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, learning other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the younger generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life aptitude like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation going, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio of 15%.
So investing now in language education is important for today's children.
The knowledge of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children better chances of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the horizon of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in the independent schools, supported by specialist teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will be taking part in Sunday's preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be over one and under 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready", he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump is starting a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote pending for his Supreme Court nominee, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's march in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for 7 p.m. eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below on a live YouTube feed.
Trump will likely address this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearings, which have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the main goal of this stream of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some momentum.
So, officials for President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week aim to "give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we get closer to the campaign season's turmoil", a Trump campaign spokesman who has resigned from the job said, Reuters reported.
Set for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the late-night rally could draw supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get Pittsburgh-area media coverage", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him with the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA demonstrates that they have the strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday's singles
After three even sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is a totally invented sports concept, but it's one that players truly believe in, and never again in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is coming from now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're looking at it as a little bit of a push, I'd say", Jordan Spieth said as he left the field at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, ahead by four points and 12 more points.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and plenty of reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural cheers of celebration got louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt who won the game on the 15th produced a similar scream, the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
"We just need to focus and care about our own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but lovely, is four out of four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duo not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players beating on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of fourball this morning, when they teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the front nine put the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the US, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose lead after coming off the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari-inspired duo led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to reach the Le Golf National standings, so far, by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, beat a failed American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the draw.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in the singles on Sunday the 12th to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four straight points when he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duo to score four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed on the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled through two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius gains, but has already lost 19 of his four-ball and foursome games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a mild breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always lead the way.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the men's major tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo scored a bold 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point lead before the singles, although Furyk's title-winning team only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in second place, a Sunday counterattack seems beyond your means.
North Korea says "don't think" of a unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were worsening distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally waive its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing centre and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first".
While Ri has reviewed already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phased' approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-step steps, his statements appear significant in that they do not outright reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought to get a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure level with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, even opposing 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
"The realization that sanctions can get us down on our knees is an impossible dream for people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust".
Ri No mentioned plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that had been mentioned by the US leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the interested party in this issue were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Still, Ri's tone of speech was drastically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that steering North Korean rockets toward US territory was inevitable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim the "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said that much still had to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for such a move, stating that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable".
The Security Council unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate action".
Pompeo claimed that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were seeking were Trump's security guarantees in Singapore as well as initiatives toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a class that teaches them to rest enough.
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in caffeinated "direct" schools.
One professor concluded that students at this world-class university often had no idea what the most basic concepts of self-care were.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after I gave a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you just telling me this in my last year of school?'
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep to her, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine to pick up in bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it won't change students' behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know the health effects of smoking", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "doing straight", he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough and quality sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, as you expect, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study programme before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for bedtime, such as when waking up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another heartbreaking outdoor approach when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to lose 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's side were looking to record their first victory of their career since their 1-0 victory in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side eventually inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his side eight points behind the undefeated Hearts, the leader of the Scottish First Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the Rangers, lacking inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With Rangers now down to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third, and only behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And further trouble could arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an apparently shot object from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances for the team that beat Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston eleven that stole a point from Hearts last week, and he must have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team strangled opponents on every play.
Rangers may have mastered the ball, but Livingston did more with what he had.
The team could have scored as early as two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-order squandered his big shot out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to tip out towards the second barrel.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a large penalty of a quarter of an hour for his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson declined the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed just two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head-to-head finish and Ovie Ejaria's weak finish.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, much less for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't cope with a long, standing Jacobs ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass for Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this trade almost had an immediate impact when the lateral forward moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly sprinted from his line to effect the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes after long passes.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held out well, defending himself against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again claimed a large penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old and continues to count... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" featuring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity on minerals".
Evans: "Look, now it's really creeping!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave it its name still stands.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "controls the growth of various cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a Trump-supporting diatribe by wrapping a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was rocked in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, stating that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, Ghost Town, which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he started a brawl against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white man and he says, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star snipped out Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West's brawler scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to trade West when he did.
Besides, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat".
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the marginalisation?" saying, "I'd put my superman cover on, because that means nobody tells me what to do.
Try love".
His comments sparked public outcry and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of the show's staff telling the newspaper: "The entire studio was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with Perrier's performance of the song I Love It disguised as a bottle.
West received a statement of support from TPUSA's conservative group director, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of our bravest spirits: Thank you for facing the turf".
However, talk show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their 'art') who I believe is welcoming and spreading ideologies that are harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the formerly known Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has used the name Snoop Lion before and, of course, the now-defunct musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after being stabbed in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Star of the War of the Thrones Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fencing master Jon Snow in the violent HBO medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that such screen roles often make boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow War of the Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has a "quite strong position" on how to approach the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up in terms of the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people".
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not be entering any prequels or sequels of War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battlefields and horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will be part of a re-issue of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that ever came out of the War of the Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on land owned by Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmission through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a major problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Studies have estimated that, because of the country's conservative values, 70 to 90 percent of men who have had sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted are caused by inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaked information about Republican senators by an associate and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information of three U.S. Senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultra-right" websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information reported allegedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters' office and published the data of a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, was not held responsible for this leak.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie".
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious", wrote Fleischer.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot be angry.
You can't take a defiant stance.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You must reveal calm and serenity".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true", he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted 'the competent authorities' to these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be exposed", he continued, "and will be held legally accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff".
Johnny English criticism Back to Attack - a weak spoof of spy film starring Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for Brexit connotations in any new British-flavored film, and this seems to actually apply to the new edition of the Johnny English comedy-action film series, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and was brought back to life in 2011 with "Johnny English's Return".
Is the ironic self-satire about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his blunt eyes and an overly elastic expression, obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, above all, that it is a comprehensive comic creation aimed at non-English speaking filmmakers.
He's, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a little Cloiseau, a Mr. Bean kick and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos on its trail.
There's a moment or two of interest in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wrapping a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a roaring noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that editions of "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We've got the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers on Bean.
Now the premise, always present, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and controversial figure, already suffering a total debacle of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this role that reminds her of the character of Theresa May, but the plot doesn't give much material for big flights.
Her secret service advisers tell her that since all agents on the force have been compromised, she's gonna have to take someone out of retirement.
And this one is the shitty Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but teaching informal lessons on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy like the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoins his suffering aide Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attracted to a submarine commander, a spooky character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin of the disaster in His Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously enchanted by the charismatic billionaire of technology who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurdly awkward acts: disguised as table servants, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they create confusion by infiltrating like clandestines on the luxurious Volta yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops were certainly made in view of this last sequence, but as nice and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of children's TV.
The result is quite mediocre.
And just like in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent?
Labour denies they are devising a plan for the British to work four days a week, but get five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants employers to pass on the savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them one extra day off.
Workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping order.
Sources say the idea would "fit" with the party's economic program, which is refocusing the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day work week gained the favorable opinion of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "We expect to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration aligned with the party's approach to workers-friendly economic rebalancing as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it".
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to reclaim power from the hands of the "faceless directors" and "speculators" of basic services companies.
Its plans also include not recovering all the shares of current water company shareholders, as the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on perceived illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of directors and to set up ownership funds including those which transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, who can annually pocket dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their minds or not.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could come up with something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, "I said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I said, "Did you do it?"
It was resolved, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, however, seems unshakable.
"I'm as determined as Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be required", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous lie", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people she mentioned could not confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an incredibly impressive list of stars who will serve an equally impressive mission: eradicate poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to watch performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal in these 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "click-a-thonism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters that have put pressure on it to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, the organization says, have contributed to world leaders having announced commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, with at least $10 billion related to them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 pressure actions on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, Power of Nutrition, which will involve 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It's been a long and winding road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will perform at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the navy as a "block" to block Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where it is invited by the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is to try to broker energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he would have said.
And according to the ruler, there are ways and means to stop it.
"The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group called "The Voice of the Energy Consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stating that they are effectively the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to leverage and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick magic" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply economically motivated, and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, chief executive of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply examine" the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "deeply examine" the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to fix our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the ultimate responsible", he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will be considering in depth the possibility of running for president".
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, stating that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren mentioned that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren's own constituents do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
59% of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Policy Research.
32% support his candidacy.
The poll revealed higher support for a candidate from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has stated that he will officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a rally by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is going through, what is going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who are feeling the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the injuries that our soldiers actually come back with", he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and stated that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back to inquire if there is such respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the armed forces, have given to the country".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district sent an amicus curiae statement Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging that policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against the policy in August has not been disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The government departments that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 Immigration Resources Board decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle", the amicus curiae brief states.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the police's ban on immigrants' entry negatively affects the US economy, stating that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belong to a specific social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in a counterclockwise search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, a mother of a feverish male baby, as she comforted him in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water".
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured her ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated abroad due to the continued strong recoils.
His eyes were filled with tears as he related how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the state's longest-running newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, an accusation China has denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked the beginning of what US officials, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariff waves on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now setting foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press".
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have about their country's worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans are alienating female voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn.
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts warn that this could spark a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The excitement surrounding the case has been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move on to a vote.
These things have no going back", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease the revolting voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at hand!" as they marched through the Senate lobby, as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all records", Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news website.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among indecisive voters in suburban areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, while disliking the president, often don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his seat as judge, it's also about how the Republicans have handled the matter and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41 percent of respondents believed absolutely or likely in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed absolutely or likely in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they considered Kavanaugh likely or absolutely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's proposal, the FBI has launched an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually molested her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two were attending a party during the period they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary tech personality, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the underlying intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data warehouse", or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data storage is that it is solely up to the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next Web era", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: tribute to the clergyman awarded the Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had received Britain's highest military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, claimed that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the event that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of handguns and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest bravery", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three detachment soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans awake all night to watch Bellator 206 instead watch Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you stay up all night watching Bellator 206, full of stars, and at the end, you're blocked from watching the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was being broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, spectators in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after being up until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
One fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"Government regulations say the content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to another schedule", said Dave Schwartz, marketing and communications manager, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, you know.
The Bellator chairman, Scott Coker, said that the Bellator would revise the broadcasting schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we can't solve it until our Sunday hour, which is Monday British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We're gonna cut the number of fights down to five instead of six, like we usually do, and we're gonna try to exceed the fan expectations and we're gonna go overboard.
It is a deplorable situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley has claimed that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he did not realize until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she stated that she spoke out in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The longtime regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley reported feeling "inferior" to everyone else because "it was socially unacceptable to like boys and girls".
In her words, "To this day, this feeling of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and strength to achieve success".
His goal was to prove that he was "someone", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "hit me by surprise".
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, 20 years older, though she has stated that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When we go through this when we are so young" - his first participation in the Olympics was at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he noted, it is difficult to find someone of his age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley stated that "their whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was 'winning a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son has the same name as her father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London games because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be here to be in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games... there was no better feeling", he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for her first song choice -- Proud by Heather Small -- which she identified with during Olympic preparation, and which still gives her chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson down on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get his form back to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record attendance, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been on the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men's major championships has divided his day between back-up and work on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what is troubling him.
Having never taken the most straight tackles even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough usually punishes errant tackles.
And if the pitch itself wasn't intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, will face the eventual British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point lead in the first 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role I had today, slapped me in the back, put his arm around me, and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who's given these teams a lot in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't looked forward to seeing him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we should move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
That could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never even matched the successes of his individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people, and is an excellent person to have in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just playing".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows his great advantage may disappear in a flash.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his slumped lead on entering the final day of singles at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an accidental ride.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with his nose with the narrowest of margins, winning by 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage at Valderrama; we had a big advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but for a short time", Bjorn said in the image, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go out there and do it right.
This isn't over until we get the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try and win this trophy and that's where the focus should stay.
I've always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who's on the other side: the best players in the world".
Enchanted by his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performance and that involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our golfing skills are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that we need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and do his best, too".
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big twists on the last day, being part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe took the "Miracle at Medinah" off the card.
"I remember all the words", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players to the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to get that fast start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is very high in these middle splits.
We've organized our actual match accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow".
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the whole trajectory", Bjorn stated about his singles choices.
New German warship once again delayed
The latest German Navy frigate was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, however it will have to wait until at least next year due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the command ship of the newest Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the navy had ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature reduction.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have meant that with the latest generation warships, seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will be outdated when they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the shipyards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the yard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would render the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the contingent needed on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the vessel is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional functionalities in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this has reached an astonishing 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems afflicting the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of use".
The politician said the problem had grown exponentially over time, as older ships were taken out of service without any vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations throughout the property to monitor the bats' activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all the recordings will assess the frequency of the bats' calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS's nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grazing and how best to maintain forests for bats and related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affects dormitories and makes habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly-killing paperwork and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given its nocturnal hunting habits, its ears are more useful than its eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of echo-location to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescue operations.
He also went on to create the first bat-only reserve in Scotland, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property's manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have an excellent area for bats", he noted.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about bats that we do not know, so the work we have done here and on other properties will help us to learn more about what they need to flourish".
He stressed the importance of verifying whether there are bats before carrying out maintenance on the property, as the unintentional destruction of just one maternity ward could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to join in helping.
She was quoted as saying, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are getting revenge".
Ronaldo denies rape charges when his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", stating that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward from the Portuguese national team and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he would then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
What they said today, fake news", the winner of five Golden Balls told the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as "an unacceptable account of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would demand damages for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is believed to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly violated her annually, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken from a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would "regret forever" for losing carmakers
The UK would "regret forever" if it lost its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Corporate Secretary Greg Clark.
Clark also pointed out that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in disarray at the end of March, we will see production shutdowns at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern concern what manufacturers claim to be the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's 'Chequers Plan' for future EU relations was 'calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks'.
"We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success but also the opportunity for us to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points to the absolute need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful supply chain set".
Although it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota stated that in the long run the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston's factory for 24 years and coordinates Unite union there, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A government spokesman said that "we have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred another week" given there is still no understanding as to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump's advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump could be preparing the firing of the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday, he moved into the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "preferably not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump's press adviser, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed for another week, given all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
I always like to keep the press informed".
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he noted that: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism".
He hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President does more question and answer sessions than any previous president", he noted, adding, without adding any evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers".
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this often, and they've seen that we've done it in the last few weeks, and the fact that you can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences, receives foreign representatives.
Ground-based press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre manner to the press.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of EU citizens applying for resident status working in the country's decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and expertise, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defensive end Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers coach Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came near the side line and practically fainted", Reed reported.
The technical team and medical personnel put Abercrombie's oxygen in the side line before putting it in a box and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/severe of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, suspended his studies during his first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five playoff appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his season total to 18 playoff appearances.
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when they acquire property in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid for the homeless
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the younger electorate.
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in homeless aid, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters, with promises to make more affordable housing available and tax higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government's campaign to provide a roof over the homeless.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases - could rise to 3 percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping property prices high by plundering land they do not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve the "housing disaster" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to "unjustified" evictions.
It also wants to give municipalities expanded powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I announced that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for British workers resident.
For too many people the dream of owning their home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep in the blink of an eye remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become a Scotland international.
The 42-year-old Scot has succeeded in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeast club, currently third in the Premier League, three points behind the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish First Division last season.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalisation", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But that opportunity will only arise if he succeeds in managing clubs".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names at such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, right now, success is all about 'can I get the club back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It won't be easy to bring the club back, but I'll only consider myself successful here when I reach that goal".
Ross' coaching career is only three years old, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the technical staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross reports that he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads", he recalls.
"I've always seen myself more in the role of a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because it went well, I made a living as a player, and I had some highs in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and the pressure of the job, but I feel really good as a coach.
I always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Restaurant groups saw sales grow by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant occupancy declined by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which compiled the statistics, noted: "England's continued good weather and longer-than-expected World Cup career have caused the June pattern of pubs growing 2.8% in sales to repeat in July, but restaurants have seen a decline.
The 1.8% drop in sales of the restaurant in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage business fared best, with a similar growth that more than offset the decline in restaurants.
The pubs with the business of dining also experienced difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals falling by 3%".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the leisure and catering sectors at RSM, said: "These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home food market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4,8% is especially damaging when added to the prolonged cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief".
The growth in total pub and restaurant sales, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.

One in five children hides secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "fake" Instagram pages
The news is compounding fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - creates social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake" accounts on the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news compounds fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that was innocent to show their parents, while also having private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account discovered that the teenager was inciting others to "rape her".
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Headmasters (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to draw on their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are sure that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from her presence on the Council", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and hope to be able to truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke today.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It's been a painful job, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and I'm even doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Milk extraction pump ad compares mothers to cows, sharing opinions online
A dairy pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in the mildew.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent milk extraction pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic music video-inspired ad to highlight the freedom the new pump gives milk extracting mothers.
Four mothers are dancing to a cowful of hay to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm getting laid, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts".
The chorus continues, "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I am sorting my girls".
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it lightened the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born", wrote one viewer.

Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a pump extraction for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone said, "A huge ad with a huge lack of sensitivity".
Others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but it makes all the sense.
This product is brilliant", wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who milk themselves (often in bathrooms or at work) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who pump milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milk extractors and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible sense of freedom that the new bomb provides.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two marched on the passerelle to designer Marta Jakubowski as she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made child custody difficult.
Traditionally, most "parents" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to remain in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential stepchildren and other adults who are members of their households would have to register their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration regulators.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the godparents or members of their family households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent access or attempted escape, according to the officials of the centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities like Tornillo's, where the large size helps to ignore signs of child disturbance.
They add that moving children to camps without giving time for emotional preparation or for saying goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma many already experience.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of the US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces'
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they "will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to 'reviewing the articles of the current constitution' and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the impeachment and scandal ends his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At this time, there are no signs of viewers' fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time viewerships have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big-time news nights.
"This is a strong call to the people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election?
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh", Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, immigrant family reunification rights and the health of the global economy.
Changing programming is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's more than just being an informed citizen when we're watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward's use of "profoundly knowledgeable" sources in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather blouse ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as the Washington Post reported) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' hollow descriptions of President Trump's... hum... anatomy.
For my part, I will never look at Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what he's been doing looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night", said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's dynamic cast and the daily twists and turns of the plot (antagonizing himself with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss an episode or we'll be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, they were 26th on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked up at home watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
I didn't disrespect television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Significant external funding in the midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th Circuit is experiencing a funding surge, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race for the same spot.
The recent readjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his seat in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th Circuit, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Circuit.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th Circuit sparked a bitter dispute over campaign funding between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress electoral district.
That seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US considered penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then backed down.
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from management.
State Department officials decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled a speech at the conference, now set for mid-October, a sign of the administration's attachment to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which currently has substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly directing his investigation to determine whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to run again for the electorate and perhaps be judged by his peers.
There are many possibilities, and I don't want to suggest that Mr Trump's downfall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
The Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this paper reported that last year he suggested secretly filming the president, speculating on his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail, given the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she had me light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how could we not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers could use that result as a springboard for higher-flying.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We played the game with a positive attitude and scored a point.
Maybe we could have won near the end, but in global terms, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we went around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get all three points, it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to get a positive result.
Last year was a tough one, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past and achieve success".
Women are losing their sleep fearing this reform savings account.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the type of care they intended to receive, few people spoke to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not having that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance division.
Here's how to start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you give them their wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for continuing care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a monetary-value hybrid policy to help cover those expenses, or financing from your own savings, provided you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a healthcare attorney, choosing a person you trust to oversee your healthcare and ensure that your wishes are respected if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a proxy for your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include that information in a written plan to be prepared.
"It's not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan".
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air pressure on his way home from a night out on the town.
The victim, in her 40s home, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 P.M.T., as a "random act".
Victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve a life-threatening condition and the police have called for witnesses.
Seismic and tsunami events in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications cut off, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, a zone north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The region, with an administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Seismic Fire, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but over 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence investigation and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su's pre-trial detention center on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent", the station reported.
Palin faces three Class A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
Your girlfriend accused you of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans associations for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been cut, with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the Central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They're circulating videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutor's office is seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The New York State's Attorney General is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a cycleway on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the death penalty notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, typically used by the prosecutor's office in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "considerable planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "atrocity, cruelty and depravity".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the notice states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the Southern District of New York hasn't asked for the death penalty on a charge.
Defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservative convention.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's deputies suggested he should lead the EU negotiations.
Background Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "been out" if Farage was Brexit Minister.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided fellow believers was underscored by the Conservatives who advocate staying, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been struggling to maintain her commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, staying-at-home advocates and the EU.
Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have left already", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will continue to support Brexit but we should end the Plan".
Strengthening his opposition to the EU, he declared: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country".
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally unreasonable".
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, telling journalists: "I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs".
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to make it".
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK".
Meanwhile, the staying-at-home supporters marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists put up banners with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticised the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for 'Canada more', for the frictionless border, for free borderless trade in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit", he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" his eventual presidential bid
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Congressman Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There's been speculation that he might face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in a debate format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it's time "for women to go to Washington and fix the problems of our government and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrested in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene, holding a gun, admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-1, Baton Rouge, La., junior, played in 32 games and was a 10-time starter last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Coming out of pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first in the boxing and made Hamilton face off against the traffic at the end of the squad, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a close skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen came off the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, switching tyres too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He ended up coming to the boxes in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the whole weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me get over him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the top two", Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happens in the Senate shows that people are "bad, malicious and false".
"Look at the beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate these last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad and malicious and false people are", Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the press releases and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you start the leak?
Do you remember her answer-- did you release the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
The escape didn't start with me.'
Well, wait a minute.
The escape started from us... no, it wasn't us", he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied the escape had left his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's claims, I did not reveal her story", Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her confidential, and I respected her request".
But his denial did not convince the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "You know what, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, malice, no matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat the Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's First Division defeat to the Belfast Giants, winning the second-hand 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants gained an initial two-goal lead with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier finishing.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had made a comeback on Friday night in Belfast, beating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the home team back in the game at 1:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the tie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first half of the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied the game again with a powerful 27-37 goal.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing the win by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower violently roared at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We were devastated by this news", he added.
However, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities is limited.
"The balance is rising, as there are many bodies buried in the rubble that we have not yet been able to rescue", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters swept through Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the scene.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances with bodies arrive every minute.
There's no drinking water.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
The current situation is truly tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, according to CNN sources, and addressed the military forces on the spot and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations.
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that claimed the lives of more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports a man missing after a plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that one man is missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The company said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable medical record.
It is not yet known for sure what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy unanimously stated that the plane failed to reach the runway and landed in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone off track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, claimed that the plane was coming too low.
"It was the best thing that ever happened", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with water around their waists and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He reported that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors working on a nearby wet improvement project also helped rescue by using a blowing boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of 100 feet [30 m].
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the timeline of events the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution closed its claims on Saturday in a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of the defendant, 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chamber, the night of his death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several cell phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting previous statements she had made.
When the data showed that your cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and claimed he had not been to town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated they only met a week ago.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"You've killed her with your life", Hale declared.
The defence is expected to begin presenting its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin to be reviewed by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City mistress sues couple for firing via "racist" text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after she mistakenly received an SMS from her mother complaining that she was "more of a black woman".
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the lawsuit was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
"I can't believe... one more time", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she learned of her vague behavior, a "pregnant" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the poor performance of her former African-American nanny and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for a $350 a day severance payment for the six-month period she was chosen to serve without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't go unpunished", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent him something that she didn't really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had mistreated them, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it".
Calling the process "extortion", Plasco said his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with "a very difficult situation".
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice", the investment banker added.
As the legal process progresses, the court of public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to put on the skin of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's so much fun to know about this now, after Paddington has been so successful".
She commented that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, would not have taken to his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the publication's 60th anniversary tasted bitter given his passing last year.
Of Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family", he said that his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a modest man and not a gossipy person", he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we were proud even when the achievement was not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Although he was the product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my cell phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call frequently to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines that doctors had given him to keep his heart functioning were slowly ceasing to work and leaving his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to restrain myself".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers unfamiliar with the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
"I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women mourning put cards on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones who committed suicide struggle to keep others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any father to have to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lit the room".
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "dived into the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found murdered by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion".
Sharon Davis created the posters "to let you know that there are people who are available to help and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't close yourself in. You have to talk".
Kelly Humphreys, Sharon Davis' longtime friend, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother-in-law died.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed", he said.
"The days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a cloth there, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them".
He said that his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "It destroys a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation.
"I thought that by having the same thing you asked for - a timely and scope-defined investigation - we could be more united", Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "crumbling" in the face of a deep-rooted party stalemate.
Why didn't they want Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters investigated by the FBI?
Your reluctance is merely a temporary matter.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, and on November 6, if the Republicans, as expected, do not get the best results, they will see their attempts to elect their Supreme Court nominee failed.
George W. Bush has been contacting the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
North Korean deserters decline during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 desertions occurred last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public statement.
As a general rule, the vast majority of North Korean deserters are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, and it often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the impasse-stricken denuclearization negotiations.
The talks followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly, to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to be the first to take the first steps toward unilateral disarmament", Ri declared in a speech to the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would have been called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a loud, sobbing voice, when talking about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the commission's Democrats, calling the allegations made against him of "grotesque and conspiracy-style murder" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton for losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proves she's not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court given her biased behavior against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if she would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that lying to Congress or the FBI does not qualify you for the Supreme Court, nor even for service in your current court", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she feared potential Kavanaugh opinions against the Affordable Care Act (more commonly known as Obamacare) or the Roe v. Wade case, given her reputation as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of overturning certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision", Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified rant, months and years of rage overflowing, and she can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do you?"
A woman with a job in a company helped me a lot. She told me that she cried when I got angry, too, but she had developed a technique. When I got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And I kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant", Mrs. Steinem continued.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office where I cried in inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- a unfriendly manager who terrified me a little -- and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say,
"Never let anyone see you crying".
"They don't know if you're mad.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy they've been able to affect you".
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, a deeply frustrated Patricia Schroeder could not see why she could not run for president herself.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision", he said laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Given his late entry, the fundraising was below expectation and he vowed to enter the race only if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I am entitled to a discount?" he asked himself.
When she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, emotions rose - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many barriers to fundraising and getting the message out to voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism - and tears came out.
"I even seemed depressed", recalled Patricia Schroeder, speaking of the media's reaction.
"I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you now write in my epitaph?
"She cried"?"
How the trade war between the US and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first salvo from the US-China trade war was deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the perspective of experts, the two countries' distance may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant worsening of the situation with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, taxing in fact half of all goods shipped by China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed to following in the footsteps of the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will falter in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean giving in to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its gains, the pressures of the trade war with the US could sustain China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated", said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher devoted to Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beat the USA and won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. now has six straight defeats on European soil since they last won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
North American star Phil Mickelson, who showed serious difficulty during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone through all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player in the European Team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most decorated European of all time with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm immensely happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods by 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics from one of the greatest players of all time with 14 major titles won and just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. National Team fought to get to the fairway.
Captain Jim Furyk, the captain of the American team, said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them.
Tomorrow we can put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were excellent.
We're gonna reorganize and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off the other team.
They were better".
Red tide updates: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to new information from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, Red Tide concentrations have decreased in some areas of Tampa Bay.
The FWC reported that conditions of lower spotting were identified in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Sea spots extend for about 200 miles [201 km] along the coast from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer areas than last week.
The Red Tide has also been spotted in Pasco County.
Last week, moderate concentrations were recorded on or off the coast of Pinella County, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, bottom to high concentrations in Manatee County, bottom to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, medium to low bottom concentrations in Charlotte County, bottom to high concentrations off or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
In the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest region of Florida.
