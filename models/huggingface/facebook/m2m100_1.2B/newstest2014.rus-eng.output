In Kineshma and the area two men committed suicide
The suspect had previously attempted suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoye at his place of residence, a man of 1947 birth committed suicide through hanging.
He has previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully mounted on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile a driver travels and transmit this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state planning authorities.
The usually boring arena of highway planning has unexpectedly sparked intense debate and colourful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track how many miles you’re riding and even where you’re riding them – and then use that information to make tax bills.
Drinking tea in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And although Congress can’t agree yet whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how in the next decade we can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of drivers have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It’s not a matter that we might have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ichrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state’s miles every California driver runs by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology for this already exists.
The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funding from the Government’s Highway Construction Fund, funded by taxes that Americans pay on gasoline.
Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even one cent at high gas prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply impossible to save,” said Lee Manic, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices have recently been installed on cars to test a false payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
Zanuod calls this a false user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes will be able to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planning authorities in California are overseeing this system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
However, House member Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters at Reason are also delighted to have drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason’s vice president for political affairs.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards pardon.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 vehicles.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal due to concerns from rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or the city.
Several states and cities, however, go this path on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is shown in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of distance instead of gasoline taxes.
The pilot project in Nevada has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which comprises the transport departments of 17 eastern coastal states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can implement these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every step.
“The concerns about the big brother and the like are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It was not what people wanted.
As the tests were underway, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union’s Nevada branch warned on its website: “It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of individual citizens’ daily movements.
Nevada is one of a few states where it is difficult to find inexpensive technology that would allow the state authorities to keep records of the miles travelled by the car, but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not contribute to the collection of state taxes.
She sought to enter the developing market of type of car insurance, where drivers pay on the basis of distance.
But the devices she’s testing are attracting road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded with a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed or their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were several major mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less compulsive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they might abandon the device altogether, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to an alert public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax device that will also accept payments on parking counters, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time pool of speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists will be attracted to participate in the benefits they will be offered,” the city planning document says.
Some transportation system designers, however, are wondering whether all the talk about mispayment is just a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Construction Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline so that they pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rantzler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine association treaty at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are ongoing with the IMF on a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about financing conditions.
Not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive aid, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered on Friday the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one stage - to "B-" from "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF may be flexible in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Per it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia is “isolating” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversible deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
"Between the EU countries and the Ukrainians are negotiating on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but by other routes," the source added.
Russia out of the fight for the pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most of the world’s metropolis since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their rearrangement and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A well-known example is Singapore, where a strict quota is introduced for the increase in the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city center.
In Germany, such as Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco class that also use high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” worth about 250 billion yuan ($40 billion).
Li Kunsheng, director of the Department of Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau of Beijing, said that the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to the level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase the use of fuel by not more than 5% per vehicle.
According to the agency, currently motor transport in Beijing is responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other measures, the “green five-year” measures include the accelerated transition to euro-fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on car entrance to the central part of the city, the ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Among Beijing’s automotive innovations is also the prohibition for all private cars to move within the fifth transport ring (a total of six in the capital of the People’s Republic of China) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle number mark), as well as the issuance of registration signs for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing amounted to only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 they were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 "moving sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
Russia is only beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The director of the Institute of Transport Economy and Transport Policy of VŠE Mikhail Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for motor travel are obviously unpopular, they can be adopted by society only under the condition of their fullest universality.
In the case of Moscow there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - official and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the fleet of Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study where the balance of urban territories between residential buildings, the area of road coverage and the number of motor vehicles is analyzed.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is equipped with roads twice as little as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time on parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but storage of cars, not to expand, but to reduce the road (so that the streets become more friendly to pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the limits of the territory of the protected zone of the historic center (a common territory of about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central districts of the city).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase in times
According to the city authorities, an increase in the amounts of fines will help to bring order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and canvases.
Most street merchants do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not go through the appropriate sanitary control.
And this means that the health of the vaggan is endangered.
So, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the press service of the Administration of Vologda.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of rising risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover,” said Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now around 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will be dealing with the optimization of personnel expenses.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies have experienced a decrease in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to redundancies and increased unemployment.
The Russian business cannot not raise wages, commented Barclays Capital’s chief economist for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is close to historic lows and the competition for workers is high.
In order to remove or retain existing employees, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported by a very rapid growth in credit demand.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the country’s economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of credit, the money does not differ in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is another – Goldman Sachs expects a rise in default on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the Russian economy is a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured loans.
The director of the Banking Institute of VŠE Vasily Solodkov already sees the signs of a rising banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, having no access to the cheap resources available to state banks, were forced to attract public funds at high interest rates.
In response, state banks went on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up the dumping, Russia threatens a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks the economist considers the forerunner of a massive collapse.
"State banks themselves will not cope with such a situation: the deposit insurance system was not initially designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, because of the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, laid down in the current version of the budget.
In part, the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the certificate), the growth of consumption will still slow, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil,” he says.
According to his estimate, the Russian economy will begin to shrink when the price of oil is below $90 / barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet able to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks have started to raise rates.
This may mean that they didn’t believe the central bank that announced the transition to inflation targeting,” said Clemens Grafe.
The central bank’s interest policy does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes," said Clemens Grafe.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank is not used by banks to lend the economy, but to manage its liquidity.
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
“Earlier or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy does not work,” Grafe said and reminded that the state plans to allow the ruble to “free float” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do it sooner or raise the key interest rate of the central bank (5,5%), he believes.
According to him, the rate of the ruble is now artificially overpriced by 10%.
I have only one way – to lose weight, concludes the expert.
But if the central bank plunges in the financiers even a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can crash the ruble much stronger.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The event is dedicated to the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies – a total of about 350 people – took part in the work of the congress.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
Here we can be an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in full mutual understanding,” says Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsk.
During the meeting, a number of issues were discussed, including patriotic education and cultural cooperation.
The Congress adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of opera and ballet.
Here opened an exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence agent, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Straubele met with Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Al the outcome of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as betrayal and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that provide no protection.”
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden said he believes the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA had intercepted the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting him at risk or destroying relations with the United States altogether,” it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, a member of parliament from the German Green Party, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “safe,” the MP said.
Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and persistent” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the world’s reaction to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials — including in the United States — have seen the exposure of the uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance as beneficial to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are solved.”
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to keep their entire bag.
The new baggage fee extends to bags in the upper luggage compartment, so small bags placed underneath the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travellers would only pay when they were on board.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should make passengers pay in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for that,” she said.
Airlines started charging the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they can in hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often leaves no space in these compartments.
Fee is one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O’Malley said the new collection wasn’t really for making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers of Frontier say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartment is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a row at the departure of the Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in a row can pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the change in procedures on the website and at the Frontier checkpoints is meant to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before they get on board.
The new Frontier charge for hand luggage will not start to be charged before the summer, although a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of luggage charges a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of flights after several years of losses.
However, most of them were not related to hand luggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discount later followed its example.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, who is closely monitoring the additional fees.
According to his estimate in a December 2011 report, the collection for hand luggage brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorenzen, a former top manager at Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight, and was curious about what he would find at the take-off when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit collection for hand luggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my career in airlines,” he said.
I expected to see teeth scratching and fighting at the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive a soda or juice can keep the entire bowl and that a portion of coffee will be provided for free.
They will still provide free water.
US Airways attempted to charge for drinks for a short time in 2008, but refused to do so seven months later after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket dealers, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than contact an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, it began giving twice as much of the bonus miles of frequent flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the miles of travel.
For example, a 1,000 mile journey from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal customers in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming profitable.
Revenue declined by 9 percent, and flight capabilities fell by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released on Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the airline.
NSA blames "internal error" and not hackers in stopping the site
The National Security Agency said on Friday evening that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claims that the disruption was caused by a distributed DDoS attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA website had not been working for at least six hours and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network was “not at all” hacked.
No classified information is at risk, the representative said.
At least one online group of activist hackers said it was responsible for disrupting the NSA website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The hacking tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously super-secret NSA, once nicknamed “No Such Agency,” has been at the center of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of disclosures about its extensive overseas and domestic surveillance programs — all in response to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by disappointed former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
Growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier profits decline with drop in aircraft orders and supplies
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, on Thursday a 15% decrease in net profit due to declining aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual issues in its railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also not released any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided any new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by next September will be fulfilled.
After the first flight of the pilot aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results failed to meet the forecasts and led to a fall of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his assessment from “above the market average” to “average market” on Thursday because of the belief that stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are disappointed with the transport sector’s earnings,” Dorxen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as its flight testing program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment, where Boeing and Airbus currently dominate.
The first pilot aircraft was introduced in March and made its first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, there are not too many firm orders for the CSeries yet – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to check the company’s claims on fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new aircraft.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodouan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft is put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Boduan said during a phone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled for the time of the aircraft's standstill.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight tests.
The second of the five test samples is expected to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow him, the company said.
And yet analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first customer will be able to start operations of the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the timing of the commissioning and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – supports our view that the launch will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerxen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net revenue fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profit per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly – from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, down from the previous year’s 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged since December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor," said Boduan.
Gross revenue in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector grew by 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the 31st of December.
The revenue of the transport unit was negatively affected by problems with the execution of several major contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichett will join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 percent to $4.83 on Thursday’s trading.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, a quarterly revenue decrease of 10 percent on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual earnings
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, concluded the previous quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced its forecast of profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s results from July to September 2013 were worse than expected due to falling demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter brought the company the first in three years operating profit of 5.2 billion yen, in the reporting period again fell to 9.3 billion yen operating loss.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing tough times, especially due to the decline in demand for TVs.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to the agency Thomson Reuters, analysts predicted that this figure would be much higher and amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product lineup.
In the middle of this month was announced the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will allow you to get rid of the need for 100 times a day to get a smartphone out of your pocket.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and revenue forecast, the company’s shares lost more than 11 percent on the morning at the opening of the market in Tokyo, dropping to 1668 yen per share.
The speech gene stimulates the formation of synapses.
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein thanks to which the "speech gene" Foxp2 performs its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes did not even understand each other.
The scientists found that members of the family had disrupted the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists showed that at least part of Foxp2’s function is to stimulate the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation.
He does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only its activity being influenced by Foxp2.
That SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in a mouse experiment.
When the genetic activity was artificially reduced in animals, they cried less when separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds issued was also restored.
Previously, the mice also showed a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals who were given a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, consequently, the SRPX2 it operates is associated with purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A cocaine addicted lawyer who warned the leader of a criminal group about a police investigation has been jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared to be exposed to his drug addiction secret was sentenced to three years in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta handed over to criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information about his investigation into illicit drug trafficking after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed Bash and nicknamed among criminals a “cool lawyer,” was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to track Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s house in Blackburn, Lancashire County, while he was at a lawyer association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta "regularly used" class A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
42-year-old Ditta passed information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today at the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditt, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was covered with shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to possession of cocaine at a previous court hearing.
The lawyer’s disclosure came after the police investigating Scarborough’s activities found out that he had been regularly talking to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him approaching Ditt's home in Blackburn and placing drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf gloves under the lawyer's garbage boxes.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditt, who was at dinner at the Iwood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta “regularly consumed” cocaine after tests found traces of class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication constituted a "lawyer's secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that besides his workplace, he had a home office, and clients were coming home to him for legal matters.
However, the court became aware that after important arrests he called the biggest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell that detectives knew about them.
In a prosecution speech, Anne White said, “If anyone knows that the law should not be broken, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close relationships with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will prove legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the ordinary relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but embarrassed it.
He got too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his uninterest.
Ditta refused to admit guilt and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holsted of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal attorney to a criminal criminal as soon as he began buying drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main members of criminal groups who commissioned him to extract valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire public trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Ditt was conducted by Lancashire’s Special Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already been convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to achieving fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after acknowledging his guilt in a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Thirty-five others were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with a death penalty in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Muhammad Ali, and the motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready for the reception of 22 thousand spectators, police officials, who were present today at the meeting of the CCR RFS.
The ticket program is overdue, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia with "Spartak" was involved only a thousand stewards at the regulatory rate of nine thousand.
Spartak fans had 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This was announced by the head of the KDC Arthur Grigoryanz.
Americans listen to Japanese officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the U.S. intelligence officials, who chose not to disclose his name, said the U.S. had intercepted the phone calls of senior Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this was the case during World War II, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, said the NHK television channel.
Officially, none of the parties has yet commented on this information.
Recall, news about the surveillance of the US intelligence services for the German Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have been listening to Merkel’s phone for the last ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, received the news of her interrogation very painfully.
She stated that the allies, which she believes are Germany and the United States for decades, such observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about Angela Merkel’s telephone conversations with German prosecutors.
The German man arrived in Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria may put grain at auction not before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain on auction not earlier than the beginning of 2014, says the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
Currently, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the market price is higher, there is demand.
"Per the grain will be put on sale after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that this year the crops of agricultural crops under the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the harvest of 2014 sowed 550 thousand hectares (on 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, the harvest remains at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no grouping "Brotherhood Circle", to which in the United States included Lepsa
In the databases of Russian security forces, the group "Brotherhood Circle", to which Washington has counted singer Gregory Leps, does not appear.
According to Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after reports in the media appeared on the introduction by the US Treasury Department of Grigory Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherhood Circle", all databases were checked, but such grouping was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia", which allegedly operates abroad, the security structures believe.
“Even in the very title – ‘Brotherhood Circle’, there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to a peer-action," said the agency's interlocutor.
The U.S. Treasury Department on October 31 announced the entry into its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Bratsky Circle" of Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsvredze, Vadim Lalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The persons on the list are suspected of having connections with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
The Gregory Leps Producer Center declined to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them "nonsense".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama ranked the Brotherhood Circle Syndicate as “significant transnational organized crime groups” and instructed the Ministry of Finance “to undermine and ban their global criminal operations.”
The inclusion of a person on the blacklist of the U.S. Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the U.S. and the prohibition of business contacts with him of persons living in the United States.
Scandalous video reached the police

Turkish politician declares hunger strike against wall on border with Syria
In mid-October the authorities began the construction of a dividing wall in the area of the city of Nusaibin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city Nusaibin on the Syrian border, Aisha Gekhan, has declared a hunger strike in protest against the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly disrupted the demonstrations.

Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was by Bloomberg on November 1 with reference to a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars for a year.
Venezuelan tourists will also be allowed to sell up to 25 percent of the Bolivar purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivar per dollar.
On the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela reached almost 50 percent.
Petroleum Industry Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramírez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the Bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of price deterrence for consumer products and goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a deficit in a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Director of "Ugra" Andrei Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelov.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - said Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe even a month.
We are examining all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don’t just want to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for a few years and certain results with him.
Kenya press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said the new media judicial body “will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media with a dead grip,” and The Standard that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have received a serious blow,” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping center.
Kenya's media has provoked the authorities' anger by broadcasting surveillance cameras recordings where troops sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing a expensive shopping center.
Police chief David Kimayo called two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
According to the new law, publishers could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, i.e. being banned from obtaining official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one penalty is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.”
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “living blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they will be able to do whatever they think, impunely.
“Nobody will ever know,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“Politicians who are given to themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenya’s lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts imposed by the national salary commission and reinstate their huge, non-taxable salary of about 532 thousand shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
In the communal payments of Voronezh will appear a new line of expenses - deductions for the capital repair of the house.

The rules will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the entrance, order the staircase cells or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
The law was approved by the deputies of the Duma.
Vladimir Ключников, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, we also need to set the order - to establish the order of the construction of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment houses."
Under the control of the state is now the share construction.
The law, protecting against fraudsters, was approved in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.

By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in equity construction.
Vladimir Ключников, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this sphere also began abuses, related to the fact that in the 98th year the shareholders were the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People began to make money from it to cover the trap, including adopting these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under pressure of the federation.
The problem of illegal immigrants in the region should be addressed.
Last year, more than 100,000 foreigners entered the immigration register.
Only one in five have a work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Ключников, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: “They have violated the legislation, but they are not criminals.”
There are no courts, but they must be deported - they must be held somewhere.
This decision was made by the Federation that at the expense of regional funds to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region such a place is defined - it is Old Olshanka of Semiluk district.
Well, and finally, the regional parliament granted new benefits to large-child parents.
Families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same amount is saved by many parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 and more children will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at the price of 30 thousand per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, native child and the third - adopted.
For them, according to the norms, the state purchases housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left shore or the South-Western microregion - a quite acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy an entire cottage.

US Secretary of State: intelligence services sometimes "go too far" when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and intercepting the US intelligence services sometimes "go too far", however the politician noted that the information appeared in the media about the intercept of 70 million people does not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not hurt during this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unlawful.
I acknowledge this, as the president acknowledges... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future,” he said.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12,5% of the country’s population is now unemployed.
It hasn’t been so bad since World War II.
Among young people, this rate is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 years are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the country's largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for employees with an internship.
On the other hand, Italy is facing the common problem of Europe’s ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the task of premature staff rotation will justify itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and landing hubs (TPUs).
It is planned to put into service 255 TPUs by 2020.
What the project really is, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was erected on the Arbat-Pokrovsk line of the Smolensk metro.
The inscription said that the transport and transfer hub was being arranged.
All this was very strange, because near Smolenskaya no land transport stops and therefore it is not possible to move on it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through Karmanitsky Street.
Now for Smolensky almost everything is done.
The flower barracks disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced with a barracks.
Here is the entire transportation.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the capital transport department.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
A flat plan involves the construction of parking spaces, the removal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even carried out by transport workers, but by professional facilitators from the Moscow capital repair department.
The transport node is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over the head and a dashboard that informs about the arrival time of the transport.
Here, for example, at the subway "Yasenevo" recently opened a quite full-fledged flat transit node.
Let’s not have the slopes, but with intercepting parking lots and a dashboard indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in the pursuit of the number of officials record in the TPU everything that happens.
As early as 2011, the municipality planned to build about all 151 nodes, of which 59 with capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020 there are 255 TPUs.
One and a half of them are planned to be delivered this year.
Although the city has a TPU development program, there are no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport".
They are by the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them is often deteriorated.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - reduction of transplant time, and second - convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging the TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
A bright example of the metro “VDNH”.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl Highway arrived in the square in front of the main entrance to the VZC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl to Cosmonaut Street.
Further from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential houses.
Unfortunately, the residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible instances.
With capital TPUs in Moscow somehow did not immediately.
The first of them began to be built five years ago at the subway "Planerna".
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And indeed, there is a sample of how the transfer node, given to investors for redemption, is transformed into a banal trading center.
No, there are platforms for buses, a shuttle to avoid going from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the chimkin trolley buses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU were not given principled places.
They were moved as strangers away from the subway.
There is still more space for trade.
One only clothes 32 shops, and in general there is almost everything - from animal goods to the car shop.
Well, in fact, suddenly who of the bus passengers will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, there is always a shopping center for some reason.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot decided to give under the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planerny" among the parking spaces placed on the floor is booty trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards looking at our photographer.
The transplant node has finally turned into a bazar.
The fact is that before the metro "Planerna" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the Prefecture merchants regretted and allowed to intercept the parking lot.
Because of the high prices, it is always empty.
The most funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
This is the roofing.
At the metro "Kalujskaja" the distance of approach from the subway hall to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to pass through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to walk around it under the open sky.
However, the designs on "Planerny" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the city planning and land commission of the municipality approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25 floors, not counting two or three underground floors.
The main monster will grow near the Tushino metro, it will have 418,7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the directorate of railway stations of the Russian Railway, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the subway, have already told reporters: in future multi-storey shops, hotels and apartments will be located.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-layer parking spaces will occupy from a third to half of the area.
Take for example the “popular” garages.
Let’s say, the garage with 258 car seats, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
So, for the parking for 2.6 thousand cars in "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "quadrats".
That's less than a third of the machine that is going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to all kinds of buses.
There are at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And that, for a minute, almost two gums.
If capital TPUs at stations and stations are built by railroads, then the rest of the platforms will be mastered by the metro.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities,” including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, according to which investors will be able to apply for obtaining the site for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadayna" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is confident.
There trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the level of the subway and the distance of approach from the subway to the tram is only 50 meters without leaving the street.
There is no excess trade.
But Moscow officials are throwing into extremes.
Either we will build nothing, or we will endanger 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate to extremism the insult to patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of the patriot feelings of citizens from the provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Justice Russia" proposes to equate the insult to the patriot feelings to extremist activities and punish for this with five years of prison.
Such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma committee on energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent for opinion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Mikheev, there are sanctions in the domestic legislation for infringement of formal features of state power - the flag and the emblem.
At the same time, according to the parliamentary, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected by insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, in the Russian legislation is not sufficiently worked out.
As an example, he cites the discussions unfolding annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the struggle against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on 9 May - a real vaccanalia is unfolded annually.
By exercising an intelligent and “alternative view” of history, some publicists come to the point that it is a pity that the cultural Germans have not conquered the savage Soviet Union!
I consider this to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual scrap” of the nation,” Oleg Mikheev said.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriot people in Russia are much more than religious, but at the same time the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriot feelings can be practically unpunished.
In his opinion, it is necessary to equate the insult to patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe the corresponding punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100-thousand fine to five-year imprisonment.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in the central part of Chile, reports Reuters.
The focus of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers to the southwest of the city, the website of the U.S. Geological Service (USGS) said.
Impulsions were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
There are no reports of casualties or damage caused by the earthquake.
Chile is in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of various strengths are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
Then the earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, Chile suffered the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960 there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of the natural disaster more than 5,000 people died.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may have no doubt that the case will be considered in accordance with the law, we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Éro.
Among the arrested Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like the other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen,” Mr. Ero told RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Medvedev said.
According to him, the activity of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are "like a powder barrel", and reminded of what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
UN announces new targets for poverty alleviation
The United Nations must immediately begin working on a new set of tasks to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the SDGs, which expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the eve.
They were included in the final version of the document that will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that it was time to “be above national interests.”
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of establishing the Universal Sustainable Development Goals,” he said.
These SDGs will be based on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers I have been granted by Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the SDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique increase due to conflict of influential people
Under the overlooking statue of Samora Machel, the founder president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to scandate slogans of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want a return to peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive officer of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
Over the course of two weeks, daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo have been among the most violent clashes since the ceasefire more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the South African government of the apartheid era as part of an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the armistice in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide into a full-scale conflict again, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
Rates are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accuse each other of the tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has been the source of recent clashes by attacking its members in the Sofala province, the traditional fortress of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then intensified as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Ghebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Ghebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt a "failed man" who wanted to use "everything left of his strength to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after reports that Mazanga declared Renamo's withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Freelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been aggravated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebusa and Dhlakama) who have faced their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says Mr. Ghebuza, who is due to resign next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was distracted when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has intensified dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent increase in kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Freelimo, they just want a renewal of peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The series of premiere films "Art-Mainstream" will take place in Moscow
The series of film shows "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place in the Roland cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA "Novosti" with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program will be opened by the French comedy of the director and actress Reim Kericci "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of working in the French capital model Maya (Kerichi herself), who due to problems with the visa deported to the homeland - to Morocco.
In addition to the film Kerichy will also show the audience a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duck "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: a love story" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the May Cannes film festival "Life of Adele" Abdel Keshish.
The only Russian participant of "Art-mainstream" will be the winning at the festival "Kinotaur" film of Alexander Veledinsky "Geograph globe drunk" based on the novel of the same name Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Victor Slushkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotaur".
Children should study myths and legends as “model of lifestyle,” the author says.
Tories about the Torah could show that “gross force cannot beat sophisticated trick,” and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to be taught in schools,” Crossly-Holland advocates a “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I advocated the introduction of them into the training program for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “disrupts interest” in children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossly-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and also wrote The Norwegian Myth Collection for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, “You may have intentions, of course, but you’d better keep them with you.”
Per the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy end, but it is necessary that there is an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o’clock in the evening on October 29 at the Gryazi-Voronezh station, transport police officers removed from a passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunken debut in the train.
The young people were transported to the police station at the Gryazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offence.
The fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police ordered administrative materials and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old guy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the entrance door in the waiting room of the station.
At the bell of the broken glass rushed an employee of the transport police and a guard of the ChOP "RJD".
They managed to arrest the man who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the Southeast LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are conducting an inspection.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case is being raised, said the senior referent of the direction of information and public relations of the Southeast LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Water meters?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about riots at the tribunes during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of all this being held by the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we see that they took a different position.
They wait for someone to come and put the order.
This is a very good position, but not quite correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let things go away.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal closely with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
Give the law promptly.
Such a feeling that it is the fans of "Bavaria" in Yaroslavl came and all this arranged.
We are external observers.
In general, it’s terrible to see the tribune being watered out of a brand spot.
This is a country that is preparing for the world championship.
“I feel like we are back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
Former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside of Russia to testify in cases of intercepting German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone calls.
A source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday that the American could answer questions from representatives of the German prosecutor’s office in writing or in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is almost impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by allies of the United States," the spokesman said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to Russia or send written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the US intelligence agencies listening to the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement bodies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The former CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of an Interfax source, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he disclosed information about the secret operations of U.S. intelligence services on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because of the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, incriminately presenting serious charges, and until the beginning of August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client worked for a "large Russian company".
About the NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel last week German media.
According to journalists, the phone conversations of the Chancellor began to be intercepted by Americans back in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
After the publication of this information, the German authorities said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarov leaves “Just Russia”
Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Just Russia", member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted a statement on leaving the political organization.
As stated by the parliamentary, the statement he submitted to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the “Justice Russians”.
We sit down and drink tea.
"For some reason many people want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomarev puts a ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal in this," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that heins good relations with the regional department of "essers".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the Deputy of the State Duma Ilya Ponomarev is not intended to refuse.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and according to the law cannot leave it.
Reports of the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party "Justice Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was that together with him from the "SR" will leave Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon disproved this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," he said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the settlement of the disputed Northern Territories.
In connection with this, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding to return to the country the land lost after World War II.
In the Japanese capital there are cars, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
Police are not stopping the protesters, they are making sure that noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
You can safely argue that New York is the birthplace of the stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the stage artist Frank Faye, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fey’s innovation was eventually picked up by others, quite recently – the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hersch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, featuring more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then achieved greater success, reaching a level where they are already too famous to play at the club,” Hersh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as “Standup for Heroes” – an annual musical-comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians attending the festival this year have gained popularity in unconventional ways, for example through shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous thanks to a role in a comedy series on a little-known cable television channel (especially the scabies "League" on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now he has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate came into acting both in Saturday Night Live and in Parks and Recreation Areas, although she is best known for the series of viral films Marseille - the shell in the shoes.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a distinctive style (the surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jessellick, the vicious, racial-focused Kamui Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the most striking moments of the festival will be the interview of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a host on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is undoubtedly the central element of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked through a street between two houses and thought, “So if I’m left with no money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistan starts talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have started talks with the Taliban.
This was by the embassy of this country in the UK, where Prime Minister of Pakistan Navaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of government of Pakistan made a statement about talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Klag, with whom he discussed relations between Pakistan and India, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister said that the dialogue with the Taliban movement has begun,” the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan," the diplomat said.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic state.
Earlier, the Islamabad government had attempted to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would go to negotiations only if the authorities would take troops stationed in areas where the Taliban operates to permanent locations and release detained Islamists from prisons.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London, where the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan were discussed.
Oil prices dropped to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about large reserves overshadowed a message showing China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
The U.S. benchmark oil in the December supply dropped by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel late in the morning at European time in electronic exchanges on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was lowered by 39 cents, which amounted to a 5.8% drop in the price for October.
Rich oil reserves have influenced its price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. reserves increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible rise in demand, judging from two reports of the Chinese industry that showed a boost in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil – a benchmark of international oil used also by U.S. refineries – dropped by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Chief coach of "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in the Friday match with "Dallas", expressed confidence that the recent night behind the bars did not shake his confidence in the Russians, reports from Dallas collector "SE" Natalia Shmelev.
And what are we waiting for,” Rua said after the morning’s “Lavin.”
Of course, what has happened troubles us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be beneficial for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
Do you think the situation has not affected the goalkeeper’s condition?
Today we will see.
"Our players will undoubtedly support Varley by helping him defend the goal, as it was in previous games this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the case is resolved by the court.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: greenhouse tomatoes will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not pass the winter without losses to health, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate for them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors surveyed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil in liters.
Strict vegetarianism, when you give up not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is unhealthy.
A complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plant proteins.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs, "said nutritionist Marina Bogai.
She gives an example of fish containing essential omega-3 fatty acids.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"In order to consume it in the necessary quantities for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says a nutritionist.
Doctors believe that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
This season vegetarianism is questionable.
In our realities there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, accordingly, this calorie he does not take," says the specialist.
This is agreed with the doctor-dietologist Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the solution.
A person is better to eat mostly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is configured to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, people do not want to bite a cucumbers, but a hot soup or something more saturated," explains his position the doctor.
According to her, from what vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
However, this is not enough for proper nutrition.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulin, the level of vitamins in the bodies of Sibirians is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in a day and in May the snow lies, is inappropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," says the physician.
Doctors note that veganism is harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegans don’t get them,” Bohai is sure.
Arifolina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, "to play the toys he wants."
He has a already formed body, skeleton, organs.
Children need to eat fully.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones tomorrow will not be repaired," she says.
All surveyed medical specialists agree on the low quality of vegetables and fruits grown in the winter in greenhouses and imported.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the microelements we need than (grown) in the open ground.
“The quality of products is not that,” says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest a larger harvest is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't get brown at the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, tomatoes are tasteless and unaromatic," the doctor cites examples, adding that they are most likely filled with excess fertilizer.
And they become suppliers of not vitamins, but fiber.
This is not agreed with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the correct approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to drive out more from a square meter, then, of course, they will water more often, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilizer, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,” she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the producer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of "stop-and-search" in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended the enforcement of a court order demanding changes to the New York Police Department's "stop-and-search" program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Second District Court of Appeal has said that the enforcement of judge Shira Sheindlin's decisions will be suspended until the results of the appeal filed by the city are received.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in the way it carried out a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and resolutions on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police department change its work practices and associated training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the debates of the parties on the petition for the suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeal said it was necessary to remove the judge because she violated the code of conduct of U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid demonstrating bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably appealing to blacks and Latin Americans under the “stop and search” program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test body-fixed video cameras in the police stations where most arrests take place.
In August, New York City decided to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose affairs were terminated after a police check.
The hearing on the city’s appeal should take place after March 14, 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
"Stop-search" has been practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record in 2011 of 684,330 people, most of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit with the court.
Supporters of changes to the Stop-and-Seek program at the New York Police Department say these changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more reliable and efficient police service, and may affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will lower the fighting spirit of policemen rather than the level of crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of complex conditions in the police because of the decrease in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that it does not stop the "stop-and-search" practice, which is in line with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stop people.
In the area of Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone was established in Moscow.
It is located in the district of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot of two kilometers from the metro station Novokuznetskaya to Bolotny Square.
Thro the course, street towers, florists, benches, urns and toilets were installed, deaf fencing and illegal advertising were removed.
In addition to the Kliment and Lavrushinsky streets, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars - Ordinsky impasse, Large and Small Tolmachevsky streets, Kadashevsky coastline and Bolotny square.
Traffic on the streets of Marosejka and Petrovka is not limited.
On the part of Friday Street from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Klimentsky street conditions for pedestrians created without removing movement and cutting off the road, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the Holy Martyr Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, fully pedestrian were the Tver pass, Stoleshnikov street and the Kuznetssky Bridge street.
The Great Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, is decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Colson Hacked His Phone to Check Confidential Message
Former News of the World editor Andy Colson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clark, who was then minister of interior.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis, a royal attorney, told the Old Bayley Court that in May 2005 News of the World received a false news that Clark was meeting with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to hack Paulby's voice mail and guard her at home to interview her, but Colson also called her and left voice messages, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person who will stand next to someone’s house hoping to surprise someone, he is a person who loves to offer a story to people to see what they will say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first?
Did he know about the phone?
He says no, we say, “Oh yes!”
Rumors about Clark's novel first attracted News of the World's attention when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Paulby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A tape containing voice messages received from her phone at least three times was hijacked from Mulkeyr's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective’s computer in which Mrs. Paulby and her sister appeared as “Projects.”
During the period she was under surveillance, Mrs. Paulby’s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap controlled Mrs. Polby’s movements.
Leaving her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said Colson’s involvement in the story was on the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blanket.
The jury heard on Thursday that Colson had come into a confrontation with Mr. Blanket about a romance with a married woman while he himself was dating his counterpart, Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Colson and Brooks deny having conspired to hack their phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkeyr, Turlbek and Weserap have confessed to hacking their phones.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to German authorities on the intercept case
Former CIA employee Edward Snowden is ready to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, reports RIA Novosti.
A letter from a former CIA employee to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Striebele, through whom Snowden delivered the message to the German authorities.
Strebele met with Snowden in Moscow.
As a result of the fire on the street wounded four people.
As a result of the fire in a collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya street, four passers were injured.
According to Interfax with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passers who were in the smoked underground passage were injured during the fire.
According to RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the capital department of fuel and energy economy Pavel Livinsky, at present in all houses on Tverska Street fully restored electricity supply.
The fire in a heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya street occurred on the evening of 31 October.
A strong smoke went out of the flood canalization loops, and smoke was formed in the underground passage, located near the "Armenia" store.
As a result of the fire were destroyed 11 houses on Tverska Street.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was extinguished.
U.S. cuts food aid to poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the U.S. reduced financial support of food vouchers, known as "foods", as the effect of the corresponding state program ends.
Food benefits for a family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the fiscal year 2012 the allowance per person was on average $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued on “foodstamps” that have been named since the time when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to boost economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts in funds allocated to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food store owners across America are worried that cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard releases 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform for PC.
This is by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game was available on Battle.net in the classical games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that at the moment download can only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service.
The game is not available for Russian users.
As the media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC, appears to be no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The platform Blackthorne, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the light king Vlasos and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlas Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Sarlak's companions and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
In the Moscow metro will appear new machines.
But they will not sell tickets to passengers for money, but for seats.
One trip of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by a special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the Exhibition Station on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket sports machines will be hosted by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and the Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
National Security Agency Confessions Increase Corporate Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany’s domestic intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the intercepting devices, and these actions led to talks between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, director of the National Intelligence Agency, again assured that the United States does not use foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal commercial secrets from foreign companies in the interests of American companies, to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract worker who became the exponent, began to publish his U.S. intelligence treasury, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel was intercepted, for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can be the target, then potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it is likely that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany should wake up,” says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the United States has been transferring commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and have expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“It’s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German business software provider SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical advancements of the U.S. spy agencies, which became famous through Snowden’s revelations, were a shock to some companies who previously thought the greatest risk of surveillance was China.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where executives of European companies are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. members abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the exposure of the U.S. data analytics program Prism.
Jim Snow, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that it physically stays in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that recent reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful nations want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and hasn’t changed substantially in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually don’t like to boast of the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the opponent.
Large companies have long adopted the idea that taking a free flash drive at a show or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least careless.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automotive company Audi, says it’s been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as listening devices.
Germany’s Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends companies to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
Nevertheless, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in the report.
The United States is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Summary in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second rank of hackers engaged in economic intelligence hacking, after China, the Washington Post claims.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company has confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all.”
Bernard Scarsini, a former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI,ly said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died by "ridiculous coincidence" believe that their son was killed
Parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a twisted sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat, adjacent from behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
Investigators at the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office have concluded that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes this.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was killed,” Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he was killed as the sheriff said.
“They think it’s contrary to logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it’s a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag and brought him back to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial screening showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxia.”
However, the second scan, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are several issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the department of the County Sheriff of Loundes was not available for comment when he was addressed on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras that the investigators viewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hope that the videos contain the key to solving how he died.
"Spartak": for information about persons who hanged fascist symbolism
On the official website of "Spartak" appeared a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance of the Fascist flag on the tribune in Yaroslavl.
“At the Cup match “Shinnik” – “Spartak” on October 30, unknown provocators at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We appeal to all who have reliable information about persons who have committed this criminal offence, with the request to provide it.
“The reward is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for the fans who hanged the fascist flag in Yaroslavl
In the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" several times interrupted due to riots on the tribunes.
Also in the sector of fans "Spartak" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
In the form of a penalty "Spartak" can hold about three matches without spectators.
A committee meeting will be held on Friday.
If you have any information about who carried and hanged this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
Now, one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness of food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools to keep stock of adrenaline – the automatic medical syringe EpiPen is most often used for injections – to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently made changes to the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline stores with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have experienced an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is ticking in my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “It’s like my tongue ticks.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “uncertain gender”
Germany became the first European country to recognize a third gender in children born with external genitals of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed to male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “uncertain” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The aim of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about surgery to assign gender to newborns, and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain a scratch product created by doctors with scratches and scars.
Approximately one in two thousand babies born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of “sexual disorder” – a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed external genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the U.S. say that if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all this happens.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drecher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female gender, but is typical for both at the same time or is not characteristic of either.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, chest and bodybuilding; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in employment, as well as the level of oppression, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender disorders now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to include male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian resident Norri May-Welby became the world’s first person to be recognized as “sexless”, defending in court the right to retain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be used a third designation in addition to M and F-X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is dragged into a new state where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are reversing another two pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the website Baby Zone that she would prefer that the children be established by gender at birth.
“Growing up a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told a parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, named after a beautiful Greek god who possessed the features of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you could erase everything and then paint again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the assigned gender when he grows up.
“In the middle of the twentieth century, this was called a ‘emergency psychiatric case’,” Dresser said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitalia was suggested by Dr. John Manny of the Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender could easily be changed.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social ones – how parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as “John/John,” his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision to completely castrate the child, removing also his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Manny presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't," Drecher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At age 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves “unhappy with the outcome.”
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but genitals of the intermediate type.
Doctors were unable to determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer genitalia and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and nobody ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual impairment that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone injections and removing his chest.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he is defending others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “encourages labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child ‘uncertain gender’,” she said.
We fear that he will promote interference.
We believe it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
German law implies that it is assigned at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baraz, a mammologist-röntgenologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual impairment and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barrac’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.”
Because her androgen receptors don’t work properly, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is undergoing a pediatric psychiatric degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Baraz said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and figure out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are okay - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel happy.
We do not have to rush to do an irreversible operation.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and removes the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child will decide which gender is more comfortable with him or her, and that’s great.
This allows children to make decisions on their own.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two meetings of the Yastreba, Habibulin first missed six shots from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed shots.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have not succeeded in doing so,” said Habibulin.
I need to find confidence in the training, probably it is worth to approach them as games, and try to the best result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components I need to improve, but at training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason after a few heads everything turns into some sort of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers – I don’t think I’m the only one – always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I’m not excited.
It doesn’t matter what’s going on in front of my door.
I’m still working on myself so I don’t miss so many shots.
It’s nice that my teammates support me, but in principle it’s simple: I need to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to play them a lot better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put it aside.
I will try to play the next game better.

Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after the consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will also be supplied to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will get such arrangements for more than 170 units of such aircraft," said Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a news conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Aïro.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, as this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that as this aircraft strengthens in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will one day be delivered to France," the Russian Prime Minister said.

The aircraft is developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment of 100 passenger seats.
Energetics of Dnipropetrovsk launched a unique program to rescue the nests
In ancient times, in order to bring to the courtyard of eggs, the peasants on a high pillar installed a wheel from a cart, and a heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been placed for a long time, so the helmets loved the columns of power lines - interwoven branches rely on wires, so that the real house stands reliably.
Grandma Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka in the Petrovsky district for twenty years has lived a true family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds lay new branches on top, and the lower layer has already passed between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it is unfortunate that the family of herdsmen, who each year nested at the yard, brought and fed three or four chickens during the summer, but you do not want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm regions, grandmother Anya called the Tsarichansky RES, which belongs to the support.
I did not expect that they would react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovsk, they were surprised that the nest is still holding, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, birds could die from electrical discharge.
And the locals were at risk of leaving without light due to the damage of wires.
Therefore, linear monitors started the operation to rescue the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornitologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University helped to develop a scheme for transferring the nest.
They also conducted training for staff of the regional networks.
The renowned Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy professionals on all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
It is estimated that there are more than 50 "apartments" in the area in emergency condition.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, resembling a vortex.
The base was splintered with barbed branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a foundation so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it.
Later, they will build their own houses.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsk region.
Near the electrical support was placed a new iron concrete pillar and placed on it a platform with an old, already worn nest.
The entire operation cost the energy companies nine thousand hryvnia.
And the other day, the same new residence took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petroivsky district in the basement of grandmother Anya.
Here the platform was fixed in the previous place, only raised over wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four other nests in the Pokrovsk and Tsarishan districts of Dnipropetrovsk.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
On the other day, the whole region was covered by sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for the phasans, the broomers for entertainment shot the labyrinth family that lived on the local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four beautiful lobsters already lay dead on the water.
Now employees of the Apostolic district department of the militia are finding out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
"Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, on the Day of People’s Unity, the “Russian March” will be held in Moscow.
According to the poll of the Levada-center, the support of the "Russian March" is growing - already 40% of citizens in varying degrees approve of the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens in varying degrees approve of the holding of the "Russian March": of them 11% treat such actions definitely positively and 29% - "preferably positively".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian March" is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions welcomed only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events supported twice as many citizens (28%).
Only 7% of Russians are "definitely negative" to the "Russian March", rather negative - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow city council agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15 thousand people in Lublin, this was announced today by the head of the security department of the capital Alexei Majorov.
This nationalist campaign has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.
At the question of sociologists “Have you heard that “Russian Marches” are held on November 4 in Russia under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?” three quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively.
Only one in five Russians (20%) know about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 about the "Russian March" was heard almost a third of citizens (31%).
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a spontaneous nationalist rally took place in the Manage Square, which grew into mass unrest.
Levada-center also asked Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
Over the course of two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People’s Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, to celebrate this holiday gather only 15% of citizens.

Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
Moscow approves “Russian March” in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was by the leader of the association "Russian", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of People's Unity, a rally and rock concert of the group "Kolovrat", also agreed with the authorities, will take place.
The “Russian March 2012”
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakiman Shore to the Central House of the artist, where a rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure of 6 thousand.
Message: Obama's election headquarters considered Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, the nearest advisors of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all-anticipated book by Mark Galperin and John Haylemann about the 2012 campaign “Double Bets: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and on Thursday evening that the president's nearest assistants conducted "scale focus groups research and public opinion polls at the end of 2011" to assess whether Biden's removal could help raise the shrinking hopes of Obama's re-election.
According to The Times political commentator Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of senior election staff and White House officials, namely former White House chief of administration Bill Daley, to assess what effect the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as vice president would have on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret carefully guarded in the Chicago Election Headquarters and the Oval Cabinet.
Only six of the president’s closest advisors — including Daily, former Obama presidential chief of staff Jim Messin and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that a replacement was being considered.
The book Double Betting claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their “close personal relationship,” but eventually rejected the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daily, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I actively supported considering a lot of things, and this was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You should remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape, so we thought, “Oh God, what should we do?”
While Daley described the study as a “necessary verification,” Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the election headquarters had invested a lot in examining whether the move would bring dividends on the vote.
“Electoral staffs don’t spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously,” Martin told AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible shift.
While Daley said he didn't think the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that, "per," Obama knew.
Martin added that the "Double Bets" does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political surveys have reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want ice cream in the dark?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first dark-lighted ice cream with the help of a medusa.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on medusas, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the shining protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH level of the protein and causing it to shine.
Chris says that because the ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream manufacturing company, says: “It’s an incredible thing, but it’s still in the very early stages of production, so for £200 you get about 2 grams of the substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to shine.
We’ve tested it for the last few months, and it seemed ideal to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made because the fluorescence of the medusa is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
It is quite pleasant to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of Susa gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to design an invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the fractures caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of medusa, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The coach of "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salawat", noted that the Omichis carried out a thorough analysis of the defeat from Magnitogorsk "Metalurg".
The expert emphasized that "Avangard" needs to pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metalurg", - cites the official website of "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkin.
We missed a lot, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to perform the game task.
We knew that the rival had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks from the course - three shots we scored.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in the preparation for today’s game?
We and the guys carefully understand each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is performed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against "Metalurg".
The game was done and the score was 2-0.
They missed a goal in the dressing room and in the third period they started to make mistakes.
Given how difficult the game was, I saw no point in connecting the defenders.
Defend with the whole team.
Now "Avangard" has a long home series, matches go over day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and fulfill the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is resolved is not so difficult.
Due to the new rules, introduced by the Russian customs, for almost a week on the border with Russia in line hundreds of fur.
Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets
In the border points at the entrance to Russia accumulated hundreds of fur.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the line is created by the Russian side, which has not warned in advance about the innovations.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the Deputy Chief of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The pass points operate in enhanced mode.
The correspondent of "FACT" visited the border and talked to the long-distance drivers, who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the road shop-café at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are rising every day, as is the line from the fur.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometers.
The Customs Terminal Novozovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine along the international motorway.
From here the goods are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, until midnight, they were still allowed, and after they introduced these rules, - complains long-haul driver Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who carries cargo transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been overnight in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4,5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who go nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to $50 thousand, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck – because no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries cargo for the amount of only four thousand dollars, but up to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival at the border - no, - disturbing long-distance drivers who arranged to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have never met anywhere!
The sellers were oriented and quickly wrapped them up: 15 hryvnia is worth a baton, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
The cafe is alone.
There is no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
Not washing or shaving.
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for me on the road.
For a week, - comforts himself another long-distance driver Viktor Skotarenko.
Will my car arrive in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 grams.
What, a crystal bottle or water insisted on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there is something else, the seller pairs.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the disastrous situation of Ukrainian drivers paid attention to the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Ambrosia and Novoazov district administrations have been instructed to provide drinking water to all who are standing in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, said Sergey Dergunov, who serves as chairman of the Donetsk Oblast State Administration.
Emergency brigades are now guarding at the checkpoints.
Biotubes will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to the rows will be resolved in the coming days.
As by the press service of the Donetsk state administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 vehicles were stationed in the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk".
Facts will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against senior officials of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership – such a statement to BNS made in the Department of State Security of the republic (DGB).
This is on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" to the President of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents, allegedly found in the Russian State Department, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the secret service, the preparation of the information attack is conducted by the department of analysis of the public processes of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania several times and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also the participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work, regularly visited Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov has been banned from entering the country.
On the eve, the President of Lithuania Grybauskaitė stated that he knows about the computer attack preparing for her.
According to her, the main reason is the successful Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and "the country's aspiration to energy independence".
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she stated that in the Kremlin to Lithuania are treated "not respectfully enough".
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of putting "only demands" on Lithuania.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk to Russia.
It was that the quality of the products does not comply with sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, the director of a school shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American high schools teenagers literally brought to despair.
The man, according to him, was forced to take his weapon and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, minor hooligans threw a man’s house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the director of the school opened a shooting at teenagers, as a result of which several wounds in the leg and arm received a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the property of the director, he was charged with attacking under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 thousand.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Literally the day before, a man opened a shooting in the center of the city of Ridgecross in the U.S. state of California directly on passers on the street.
After this, the criminal held hostage two accidental passers, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was opened at a primary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam’s mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
US school shooting: 14-year-old girl wounded
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and make a mascara for our area.
I look more like a scrap now.
I haven’t been challenged to distribute candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I’m probably not going this year either.
Statistics, however, show that I am a white crown when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation estimates that costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year on the peak of fashion sexual unanimated items.
Women no longer have to be sex professionals; they can also be sex food, such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure the Daft Punk-style astronauts will hit our Instagram tracks this year.
According to Google, the costumes they look for most are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on suit for pets.
This means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not small.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, candies, Milk Duds sweets, Twizzlers chewing sweets, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for 41 million candy-seeking children who are preparing to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and – let’s not deceive ourselves – eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, 35 million pounds of them are sold on Halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like a ghost house.
They have stunning titles, such as “The Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “The Voice and the Cry” and “The House of Shock.”
Moreover, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost homes in America that generate about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you’re almost described, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can’t remove, and then the guy you like sees that photo and leaves a commentary like “classy facial expression.”
Finally, let’s talk about strawberries.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pineapple when we were children, and cutting out Jack’s candlestick is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we’ve been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, baby buckwheat fashion started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting those bucks rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkin.
The slowly drying Jack’s candlestick on your doorstep is probably coming from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want tasks to be more complicated, visit Tim and Susan Mattison in the city of Napa, California and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the press service of the ministry said.
According to Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Tymar Peterskop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly fixed everything, so far the site has been restored.
“The damage caused to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Petrokop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
"We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted on the network an appeal in which it confirmed the hacking attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defense website and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO countries.
Ukraine does not need NATO.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be the slave of anyone.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
“Hands away from Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine that the Naval Infantry of the Feodosian Separate Battalion of the Ukrainian Naval Infantry will take part in the command and staff exercises of NATO reaction forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the bullying of impure force, several schools and hospitals had to be closed
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of Southern Matabeleeland had to be closed due to the fact that students were attacked by ... goblins.
According to the local elder, the children were in panic, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
The story of the Goblins may sound like a child’s fiction for a European, but in Africa it’s quite a serious argument for shutting down a school.
Adults are also afraid of impure power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because of the fact that the medical staff was also attacked by goblins.

Russian security officials know nothing about the grouping "Brotherhood Circle" - New news
This is by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After reports appeared in the media about the U.S. Treasury’s entry of Leps on the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate ‘Brotherhood Circle’, we reviewed all the databases, but no such grouping was found,” he said.
According to him, the dissemination of this information contributes to the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
Earlier, the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group Brotherhood Circle.
Among them was named Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Gricha", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer they coincide.
The exact name - Gregory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five others mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, it is believed that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, carried money for the bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and indicates all his data that corresponds to reality.
Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions on Leps.
The inclusion of a person on the blacklist of the U.S. Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the U.S. and the prohibition of business contacts with him persons living in the United States.
Leps assistant Maya Serikova said that there were no notifications to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Gregory, about whom everyone is talking now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there were no notices to him personally, although I do not know if there are such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the U.S. Ministry of Finance, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Escaped on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details about the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak" became known.
According to the head of the KDC of the Russian Federation Arthur Grigoryantz, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Moscovite.
He is currently detained.
In addition, Grigoryantz told about how the fan managed to break through the field: "It turned out that this, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He approached the ambulance, which was confirmed by the ambulance doctor.
Then he pushed away two accompanying men and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran through the whole field.
This is the responsibility of the stewards.
Prior to the entry into force of the sport law, this is the zone of action of the steward – the police cannot interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the tribune and crossed through the Eastern tribune.
At this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the running tracks," the head of the KDC said.
According to the decision of the KDC, the Moscow "Spartak" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against "Lokomotiv" and "Zenit", and will also pay a fine in the amount of 600 thousand rubles.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy who stuck at an altitude of 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career concession
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after falling into a small car accident
Three days later, she was stuck in a career, noticed by a man walking her dog.
Firefighters descended on a rope on a slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after firefighters were called to pick it up and transport it to a safe place after it somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope of the slope.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flippit Career in Denholm, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They ferociously searched for their missing dog and posted appeals on social media sites after she fled into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a vigorous dogmaster noticed Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet on a career drop.
A technical rescue crew from the Klekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to save Ruby, and used the carrier to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move the muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But now she is okay.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a possibility that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and it was found that everything was fine with her, except exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “It was terrible to watch the rescue.”
I couldn’t believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had debilitated and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very courageous, what they did.
We were so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from the town of Kitty added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can’t believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn’t play with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a back vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and said, “He was playing with me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the 70-year-old said that Jagger "catastrophically denies that he ever struck Katy Perry."
The spokesman added, “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at the top spot this week.
George Kerevan: Breakdown with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European Free Movement Area as a condition for membership in the EU.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with a clutch wire along Adriano's shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed out the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although — predictably — this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has pointed out that EU member states are spending a lot of time reversing their formal rules as they find it convenient.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
This is not a story worthy of attention.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard the “utka” about “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the re-telling of an old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey the orders of Europe?
Why change the yacht of London to the yacht of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Thro the European Union, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year only – emerged from nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing the “Free Democrats” (an analogue to our “Liberal Democrats”) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan of creating a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, have led many to think that the “Europe” project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, which was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, Southern Europe is in a previously disadvantaged position in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only rescue is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency challenges lies a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capabilities.
As a result of the package of green energy measures implemented by Brussels — a code that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas than in the United States.
These are paralytically unfavourable price conditions, as we have seen in Grindelwald.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the devastating victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
The result is a riot, especially in France, once the most fervent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the ruined French economy in a disaster.
The result is that Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, anti-EU party National Front has just won decisive additional elections, bringing the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes – a timely warning to British Labour that one cannot assume that a right-wing split will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — anti-EU parties get support at these elections, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: soon the growing anti-EU and anti-unified currency sentiment in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like a vague “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that liked General de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent economies could keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be ignored in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to the hell.
I suspect that Scotland will succeed in a more free European arrangement if we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating the experience of Norway and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is – strangely enough – the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Treasury Chancellor Alister Darling and the subsequent Tory and Liberal Democrats coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Early Ageing
African and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the trigger mechanisms of early puberty
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eteridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family affairs.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter starts to form mammary seeds and grows pubic hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents—usually this doesn’t mean a quick start to full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and hip hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a small shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has dropped from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion about what represents the actual onset of sexual maturity, but is considered “preterm” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
A faster progression can serve as a basis for tests with an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to slowed growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child’s age, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is cautious with drugs, but admits that “suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’ll deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter had menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn’t emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, like in girls, puberty occurs earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the premise that has the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which linked the amount of body fat with the periods of puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have hair on the face and scalp appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of the young age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeeb Children’s Hospital in Morristawn, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean a earlier conversation than expected,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
American Boeing trapped in Chita is preparing for departure
The U.S. aircraft, which conducted observation flights over the territory of Russia within the framework of the Open Skies Treaty and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the airport of the city.
The management of the airport allowed the departure of the aircraft, receiving money for fuel.
As in the airport, the aircraft will depart to Ulan Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
As, the aircraft flying in Ulan Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal region due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
On board the aircraft are 30 people, including the crew, two nights they spent on the territory of the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to exit the boundaries of the Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and involves 34 countries.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to develop transparency, facilitate the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, expand the capabilities for crisis prevention and crisis resolution within the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the deceased celebrities earn - MC in the US
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $ 125 million.
But it was "broken" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Remarkably behind him are other famous people who left the life, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "rich" celebrity who left, compiled by Forbes magazine according to the results of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below the author of comics Peanuts Charles Schulz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow opened the first boutique of Igor Gulyaev
On October 23, the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now they will be able to appreciate even more fashion fans - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, for which the designer and arranged a party in the style of dolce vita.

I am very happy to have a shop in Moscow.
It’s not just an office, it’s a place where there’s really a part of me.
It was with such words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted to ... take a look at the models!
Jet aircraft manufacturers argue over seat width when large orders are on the table
A fierce dispute has erupted between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always at the center of the attention of airlines, while the volume of space allocated for them plays a key role in claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class cabins, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says that this should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft — especially whether there are nine or ten people in a row — is central in statements about the cost-effectiveness of new mini-airbus projects.
Boeing claims that its upgraded 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on economy-class seats over 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in the economy class on 18 inch wide seats located 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange strikes on technical issues through advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly ahead of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to be the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed to each other, titled “Would you agree to it?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats that are narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales manager John Lehi.
With a change in diet, people are gaining weight, but airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American man’s waist circumference is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist reach of those recently called the “reactive audience” was already there.
Airbus says it has ordered a study showing that an extra inch in the width of a seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is challenging Airbus’ seat size figures and says manufacturers shouldn’t interfere with decisions about how airlines should balance tariffs and convenience.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s all about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said Boeing cabin specialist Kent Crawler.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is increased side space, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute lies the race for orders for aircraft valued at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first in July, the location of the seats is precisely what warms the rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing are reporting a 20% one-seat increase in profitability in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's stated characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seat rows of the 777X with the original 9-seat layout of the rows of the 777.
The win in the share cost is reduced when compared with the 10-digit layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to push more space and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Kenniston, head of Airbus’ passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full 10-seat rows for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower rates.
“The eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ offer is caused by a threat from the 777 model,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers that airlines can choose from.
Traveling around the world jet vendors even take roulettes with them to check competing schedules.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very dense cabin layout for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10-seat rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider spaces on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “up” but could distract from the wave of sales of the 777X.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could deprive smoking of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Wale Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are encouraging.
“We are very hopeful that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern remedies,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine blow.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice who were not given the vaccine were relaxing, and this is a sign that nicotine has reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get that pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research is needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in Moscow are fully subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of rural settlements in the Moscow region are entirely subsidized.
In total, 187 of the 288 settlements receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidies.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget,” Oleynikov said.
Also, the deputy governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mytišt, Odintsovo and Pushkin - the volume of budget revenues is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough."
The cost ofining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in the Moscow suburb is more than 70%, "at the same time there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov noted.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow suburb to consider, by the end of November, which settlements need to be consolidated, unified into urban districts or changed the system of administrative administration.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, the number of rural settlements will be reduced.
Also in the Mojave, Kashirsk, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensk districts, Luberc and Kotelniks there is a request for consolidation of municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moscow Duma, Igor Brincalov, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the suburb of Moscow are planned to be united within the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than one-third have a “acceptable” financial base, and 100 are subsidized.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she receives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that it is now that Arbenina especially gives a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to mess with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their learning, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook of her teaching children to read.
And yesterday she applauded the fans, showing how she dressed Artema and Marta for Halloween.
Our first halloween" - so Diana named a photo of her children dressed in holiday costumes.
What is nonsense, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have anything to do with this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe to introduce “uncertain gender” when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow the registration of children born with hermaphrodites to indicate "uncertain" instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave for a time the column "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female gender) or "M" (male gender), parents can temporarily write "X" (undetermined).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush with the operation to "specify" the gender.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obayed
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be a figure in the investigation of the state's anti-corruption supervisory body.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changes to the rental procedure at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obayed, who secretly owned shares in three state-owned real estate properties.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to extend the rental agreements to the Sirkülar Ki, where the Obayed family owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender after their expiration in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obayed's covert involvement in real estate properties, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of administration Lynn Ashpoul on Thursday.
For several years of discussions, which began in 2005, the government has insisted that the rental be put on an open tender.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted longer rents.
In 2009, the contracts for hiring companies for Sergey Ki, which brought the Obayed family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obayed, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged changes to the government’s rental policy.
The decoding of the phone conversations presented by the ICAC included talks in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obayed, Mr. Tripodi, and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obayed in the fisheries department.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone talks a question of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willy Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obed.
According to a senior official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military planes attacked a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said that at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile cargo inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for "authenticity"
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it envisages expanding repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on the criteria aimed at preventing class 457 visas from being used to fill unqualified positions or as a trap for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document, submitted by the government for discussion, was released today, while former Labour MP Maxim McQueen criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the line’ and ‘started work for Australians’ represent a very unpleasant retreat to a time when trade unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that had to be protected — and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I’t be surprised.
The document, presented for discussion, outlines 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criteria are accepted, the applicant for the visa can be examined for whether “the application is authentic in circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise.”
Companies may also be required to report on the number of holders of subclass 457 visas, as previously companies intended to sponsor a small number of employees then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s sadly killed nine-year-old son had accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities hastily sent the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The friend of Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
Friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov Yevgeny Vavrinjuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
We will remind that Vavrinjuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her behind her hair, and also beat - after the attack, her arms, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with guilt to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail of $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in his movements around the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinjuk.
He is also facing up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project envisions the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and northern England, with the start of Phase One in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project “will unite Britain”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and shorten travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to overcome the journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about transportation connections between cities; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connections thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alister Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael to “unambiguously” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said, “High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the general argument for high-speed rail across the UK.”
Therefore, we are pleased to partner with the UK government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edimburg railway line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Is Tory a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear energy costs both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste in recycling.
Recently, scientists paid attention to thorium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and as experts say, its fragmentation leaves no waste to be stored for centuries.
Rules for using electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for now
Australian airline passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite U.S. measures to mitigate rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in "Flight Mode".
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are upset that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which has required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to comply with the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Administration also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in effect in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Flight Safety Administration currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety rules communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator's instructions.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Flight Safety Administration’s consideration of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (board wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” the spokesman said.
Qantas has said it will abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAA decree applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will carefully examine the decision of the FAO and the reasons that caused it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resilient to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review guidance, training materials, rules on hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline has tested and confirmed its fleet’s resistance to interference, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any height,” the statement said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartment during take-off and landing.
The leader of Dagestan heard in the national anthem of Kubani notes of extremism
The football match between "Anji" and "Kubani" resulted in a political collision between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and Kubani's anthem sounded differently.
Dagestan’s leader, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday proposed that Republican parliamentarians appeal to the court because the Krasnodar region’s anthem allegedly calls for inter-ethnic hostilities, in particular, calls for war with the “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
This is a shame and nobody does it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother of the native, on the enemy, on the basurman, we go to a deadly battle" - for what such words to write in the anthem, to strain some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov the chairman of parliament Hizri Shikhsaidov.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now news from beyond the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel hit Russian-made missiles, which, according to reports, were intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition – to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement reached with the mediation of Russia that allowed the U.S. not to conduct the military operation it approached this summer.
More details about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that was arranged by Assad’s friend, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts said Syria had dismantled alleged chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we know, it is about a thousand tons.
Washington has said that Assad’s days are numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
He feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called a success of diplomacy, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly easier than not being killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is still standing.
Changing weapons for power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry that oversees construction and housing issues and proposed to head it to former governor of the Ivanov region Mikhail Meni in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Russian President's press secretary Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and residential facilities are transferred to the new ministry from the Minoregion.
Mikhail Men - the son of the famous Orthodox priest protohierarch Alexander Menya, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergey-Posadsky district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the government of the Moscow region, the deputy prime minister of the government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was governor of the Ivanov region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is struggling.
In a lombard at the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga puts a golden bracelet, ring and eyebrows to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband is also working, the family’s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in different parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is such that ValueMax, where it is conducting its deal, this week became the third lombard listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry mortgage loan is not just a quick way to get money ($1,300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, Lombards in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% — slightly above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Lombards have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
That’s why millions of people across the region are turning to lombards as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and rapidly rising household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to lombards to offset the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in family lending, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped this list with 80 percent of GDP compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely got out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening consumer demand.
“The point is that as prices rise, people in the middle and bottom [income scale] will be looking for ways to replenish their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Wung, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The record high gold prices in the last two years have intensified the rush with which people put their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things that are laid in the city-state's 200 lombard points are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put a grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest lombard operator EasyMoney has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months.
The growth in the lombard business is such that ValueMax, which operates a branch in Bendemira and 15 other in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but beyond Asia as well, says Yehah Lee Ching, ValueMax CEO.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of a listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have caused fire of criticism over the high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the Lombard not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Customers place items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasingly widespread public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure funding.
And at the same time, lombards are not only used by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches to deposit gold clocks or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short term for commercial projects or investments, or small business who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” Ms. Yeah says.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of existing medical institutions and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of the medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of the medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure for the provision of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and pregnant women.
Thus, after the combination with the primary hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to engage narrow specialists from the GUS "NGCB" for consultation of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity house was significantly improved, modern equipment appeared, which meets world standards.
Over the years, approximately 8 million rubles were allocated for capital repairs of premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased in the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operation during a cesarean section, the "Sell-Saver" device is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, return it to the mother, avoiding transfusion of foreign blood.
The clinical and laboratory diagnostics department is also equipped with modern equipment.
There is an electronic registration in the women’s consultation, and the introduction of electronic cards and patient history is planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Inhabitants of Chechnya were arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
It is that the bandits ordered prostitutes in one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then beat and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old previously convicted citizen of Chechnya.
Bayern defender David Alaba was named the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he outperformed representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jump from the trampoline Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Philippine-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Former wife of Arshavin rests with actor Andrey Chadov
The former civil wife of the footballer of the Petrograd "Zenit" Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends a vacation together with the actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy in the company of the actress Anastasia Zaporozhna, her fiancé - figurant Sergey Slavnov, and actor Andrey Chadov.
Photos from the joint walks of couples were posted on Instagram Anastasia Zadarodzhna.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrew and Julia.
On October 5, Zadožnaya posted a photo of a couple standing hugged on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarov.
In mid-October, the head of "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civil wife Yulia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is meeting with ex-model Alicia Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to the corporation's top manager.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmania healthcare
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened healthcare system will be supplemented by strict conditions that ensure the state’s government won’t spend money in vain.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliebersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the island’s aging population, higher levels of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The decision on funding for four years was made after the government consulted with Tasmania’s independent deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific challenges facing the state,” Ms Pliebersek said.
The $325 million package includes a $31 million flash campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract removal, will help overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics hosting patients without pre-registration, in Hobart and Lonseston, to improve post-hospital care quality, train medical professionals, mental health services, and implement personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go on to implement the ideas expressed by advanced doctors on how to better help the Tasmanian healthcare system,” said Ms. Pliebersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmanian government will operate in strict accountability and accountability.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will not solve anything “unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s healthcare system on a more sustainable foundation.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to bringing this state’s healthcare system out of a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selection procedures will largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement represents “a solution similar to a leak patch.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labour government has stolen $430 million from the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government is taking away half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million, you can’t pretend it’s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Pliebersec to ensure that no dollar from the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicole’s screenplay of Denis Diderot’s novel boasts exceptional production and historical details, but it’s also harder to perceive than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by her family.
When she begins to revolt, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of a sadistic princess and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
A film never goes down to vanity or sensation – and that’s the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks to become a test like a whistleblower and for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its means of making chemical weapons, says observation group
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, an international observation group said on Thursday, while fierce clashes have erupted in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announced the
On November 1, the Hague-based organization set a deadline for Damascus to destroy or “make unworkable” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed with toxic gas and filled with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve-paralytic gas sarin.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, in which experts believe a chemical weapons production facility is located, as well as a place of its storage, according to the British-based Syrian Human Rights Center.
A group of activists, which tracked losses through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of this number, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, according to the statement, were 2202 army fighters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate dated July 25, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have fought in Safir for several weeks with rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide concrete data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who are pursued by their short-term mission to clear Syria of the toxic arsenal at the height of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and seen destroyed all critical means of production and equipment for mixing/fueling claimed by Syria.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they completed the first round of inspection work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were not able to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria’s statement, “abandoned and... chemical weapons program items in them were moved to other declared locations that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safir was one of two places that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which should be approved by the OPCW executive committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage you have all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said Ahmet Uzumjo, the general director of the monitoring group, in a comment published by OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has faced rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of his Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center, Rami Abdulrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over conviction of organisers of terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 killed in the 2002 Bali bomb blast furiously reacted to the sentence given to the last of the conspirators who stood before the court and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent 10 years running as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he gets conditional release.
The 45-year-old accused was found guilty of mass murders as a result of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were wounded.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including the wave of church explosions across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment, although they could insist that a man nicknamed a “subversionist” for his reputation as a master in the manufacture of explosives should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of a mother from Perth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices a decade ago.
Hardly holding back her tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He should stand before the shooting team, Ms. Courtyn told AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have grandchildren anymore and I won’t see my daughters anymore.”
The Sarri Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into action in a truck parked outside, immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek must share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islam, responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlasa and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
This man deserves the death penalty most.
To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the last suspect of the terrorist attack in Bali to face trial.
He hid for a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent revealed that intelligence data indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” Ms. Courtney said.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much pain he had done to others.
The verdict was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Cortin says.
Patek can appeal his sentence.
FAA: "Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from mobile phones)"
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines released on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Warta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show FAO how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device laying rules to meet the new guidelines.
FAO said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the aircraft is closed.
They should not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain does not give “good.”
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the aircraft descends for landing and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, FAO said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleeding, president of the Association of Professional Boat Crews, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to this), it will be a non-performing option,” Gliding said.
We’re frankly tired of feeling “school duty” when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the internet for surfing, emailing, texting, or downloading data will still be banned at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" — an intelligent internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when a rumored incident occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was near the landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be placed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calling from mobile phones during the flight will also be prohibited.
Regulatory authority on telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAO may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can interfere with cellular communications whilst the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the government allow for more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increasing pressure on FAUs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, say there are no valid reasons for the ban.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers — the high-tech gadgets of the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAO as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi on cruise altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of launches are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Wertha said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when browsing pages.
But the signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was the company Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company’s representatives loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book reader and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes the interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual reports from pilots confirming that the devices could interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
Nevertheless, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during instrument landings in conditions of limited visibility.
A group of tourism industry representatives welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who are now using a variety of technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct driving license exams
Driving license exams will be accepted by private companies with their own computerized motorway.
This is by "Kommersant" with reference to the draft government resolution "On admission to the management of vehicles".
As the newspaper writes, currently in Russia only about 30 such motorways.
It is expected that students of such "privileged" car schools will be counted the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Auto Inspection will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the platform students do not pass from the first time, such a school will be deprived of the privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the highways contained in the draft government decree come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheel machinery.
As of January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass the exam in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign licenses.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird transferred by air to a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
A bird flown to the shore after being found exhausted at an oil tower in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed on a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month and then dropped by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Center.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a strong wind zone over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has depleted and was able to find refuge in the oil tower.
He added, “She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes UK wealth and job creators want to see in relations with the EU.
For this purpose, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We found that the overwhelming majority of are currently looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil instead of wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the cluttered EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trading area, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
Last and most indicative, our survey of business executives revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a course of treaty change and relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will return powers back to the UK.
The rates are high — reaching changes to the treaty and more favorable terms for the UK will provide a 16-percent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the euro area embarks on the path of closer economic and financial unification.
Employment and economic growth in the UK should be given priority, and as our survey results show, for this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activities.
U.S. intelligence services intercept Pope’s private phone
The Vatican’s activities are under vigilant control of American intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all of the previous Pope Benedict's talks, and is now closely overseeing Pope Francis.
His phone began to be intercepted even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election of the new Pope was also monitored.
What was given special importance in the United States.
The special service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to elect the next Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the conclave participants lived were also intercepted.
American spies listened to all the main candidates for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an unwanted figure for Washington.
The magazine “Panorama” writes that “the big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the conversations of the prelates until the conclusion of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that in the United States since 2005 the Argentine Archbishop Bergoglio has been identified as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence also delayed negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work in the US embassy in Rome, mining information about politicians and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has reconciledly declared that it is not concerned with American "intercept", even if it happens.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the US leadership.
Snowboarder for Olympic bill was photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a memorial banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will take place this winter.
The nominal amount of the note is 100 rubles.
But in the network bloggers are already actively ironic about the memorial banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they paid attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free stock photo store StockExchange, where this photo is dated to 2005.
The same photo is used in a lesson on Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in the blue-blue range.
On one side is depicted a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - the view of the Olympic stadium and the hot bird.
The design author of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from the trampoline, but in the end they chose snowboarding, because it is a relatively young sport.
According to the source "Izvestii", close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public about the widespread distribution of the image of the snowboardist from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But the state is not too concerned about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the State Sign Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestia", that all reasoning about plagiarism is ridiculous.
Snowboarding on the banknote is turned to the right, on the photos in the network - to the left, - Nikiforova said.
The person in the photo session to create the bill was shot from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - a characteristic pose of a snowboarding.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic note is positive.
Recognition of the image on the note - plus for its promotion, - believes the executive director of NP "RusBrand" Alexei Popovich.
To prove the 100% similarity of images on banknotes and in photo banks is quite difficult, so lawsuits to challenge intellectual property on this image is unlikely to arrive.
For the first time an Olympic banknote appeared in China - a memorial banknote of 10 yuan was issued for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia has decided to uphold this tradition.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russians are in a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and it is in the best case.
Businessmen initially expected growth.
After all, this year is unlucky for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
About all this told the head of one of the largest brewery companies of the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Goods of Everyday Demand in Russia", which just ended in Moscow.
State regulation of the market was discussed.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer – a low-alcoholic beverage.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer noted that many legislative bans aimed at reducing the level of alcohol abuse do not have a particular impact, however, new initiatives are constantly appearing.
The worst of all on beer producers hit the introduced since this year ban on selling alcohol in kiosks.
“We lost 35,000 consumers at once,” said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the brewers have two forecasts.
The optimist is the one Sheps said about: the sales of foam drinks will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic – will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from varieties designed for mass consumers to the "premium" class: beer will be smaller, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of illnesses caused by alcoholism remains approximately the same level," said Dr. Alexey Sotnikov.
However, the proportion of patients who use substitutes for strong drinks has increased, as well as those who "settle" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks such as "Jaguar", while ten years ago "beer" alcoholism prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford factory in Vsevologsk.
As the unions say, all the dismissed were compensated.
However, far more acute than the problems of the workers, the issue of reducing industrial production in the region arises.
Deputy of the regional Zaksa Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that in the factory of the company "Ford" in Vsevologsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then, according to the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, about 600 people left the factory.
Workers who decided to resign voluntarily were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I think this will not be limited to this.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to accept any programs of support for regional enterprises in a difficult position," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In "Ford" this information is neither denied nor confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the "Ford" factory in Vsevologsk go a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to dismiss 600 people were announced in September.
Previously, the factory announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As a reason at the factory called the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, in the nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4%.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during the take-off and landing of aircraft.
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of the aircraft have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with new rules coming into effect by the end of 2013.
However, internet connection for receiving and sending emails will be prohibited during flights at an altitude below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will still be banned.
Passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft technology and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, according to the example of the United States, in Britain may also be revised the current rules of use of electronic devices in flights.
The Russian mafia in the United States has a new name - "Brotherhood Circle"
This week, the blacklist of "Russian mafia" in America was supplemented with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the United States suspected of carrying money for members of the group.
In total, the U.S. blacklist includes 22 people involved in the Brotherhood Circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts doubt that such an organization actually exists.
“The statement about the Brotherhood Circle is more like an attempt to unite dispersed criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
According to him, the “Brotherhood Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
"I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," Galeotti told the U.S. Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti is also the professor of the George Mason University, Lisa Shelley.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brotherhood Circle" unites the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashov, who added the list in 2012, were closely linked to Grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandfather Hassan's nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personalities have nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were united by more common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Brotherhood Circle" of Gregory Leps - the favorite singer of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Gazprom chief Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
“Today a landmark event took place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is home to most of Russia’s gas for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “for ever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other countries located further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Saratsky district, the driver of the car "Peugeot" went to the opposite lane on 115 km of the Odessa-Reni route, and collided with a bus, which was six people.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual assault before the charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission said.
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual abuse of children before they filed charges in 2011 against Jonathan Lord, an employee of a child care facility in Karingbach, the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children said.
But the commission’s introductory statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Philip Hayer was asked about one case where an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes and another case where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayr told Gale Farness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in its introductory speech to the commission also admitted inaccuracies, arguing that “there were YMCA external checks that acknowledged that YMCA is at the forefront of ensuring children’s safety.”
The committee’s testimony suggests that YMCA was notified that it received the second from the end of four possible assessments on the results of a quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hayr, who joined YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management failed to hire Lord and failed to provide staff with a clear understanding of their obligations to report child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayr rejected the assumption that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
Officials testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with the children, taking care of them, kneeling with them, saying he loved one of them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oquell, who was under Lord’s leadership and asked to educate her on the protection of children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of the YMCA branch in Karingbach who was Lord’s head, “very frightening and often difficult to reach.”
The executive said he did not accept explanations from employees that it was inconvenient for them to report the situation to their senior executives.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with Lord distracted them from the idea of having to report about him.
Mr. Hayr said he presented to the New South Wales YMCA Board his opinion that the lesson for organizing from the “Jonathan Lord incident” is not “related to providing information” by the staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hayr said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the accusations appeared was made by YMCA’s Director-General for Custody of Children Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the corruption of the evidence, but that it was “exaggerated” and that the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children during Jonathan Lord’s work at it between 2009 and 2011, said the committee expert on children’s upbringing professor Steven Smolboon of Griffith University.
He said there were “serious problems” with the recruitment, selection, instruction, training and control of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.

Tony Blair said he would take the chance of returning as UK prime minister, but acknowledged that a return is unlikely.
In an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his departure, the 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since resigning in June 2007, after ten years as the leader, Blair has largely avoided discussions about British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked whether he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to London's Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely that it will happen, so ..."

Consortium events experts who came to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that the competition would be very high.
But nobody was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a pupil, only a few months before he made his first steps, this little boy with his puppy, the Shetland ponny Toffy rushed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair – of the same height – received high ratings for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sanibank equestrian center in Radry near Cardiff.
Going out to the public view against the backdrop of men and women in elegant hat-cocktails, he moved his hat and proudly spent a round of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his innate ability to handle horses.
Toffy received the highest appreciation for his appearance and character.
Fenton was presented to Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been playing the Shetland ponies every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffy are a wonderful duo.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all delighted when he won.
Absolutely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a photo with him.
This boy from the village of Nantigo, near AbbVale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “The whole audience was shocked, and everyone shouted approval and knocked.”
He ran on the sand all along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging from how he started, he’ll soon be taking part in the Horse of the Year – and I’m sure he’ll perform well.
A spokesman for this annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges honored Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for how they presented themselves on the show ring.
They evaluate the harmony of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffy were the best on the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the appeal is “subject to reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which published a call on the release of the accused of slander reporter, should be reorganized, the press regulator reports.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he took bribery for writing false articles about a state-owned company.
Now the “New Express” must undergo a “process of complete correction of errors”, as by the regulator.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Administration in the fields of press and publications, radio, film and television.
The preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group-owned New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The management of the New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He that the decision was made to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his reporter license.”
He also “instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to complete the correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended it to investigate the situation-related responsible persons of the newspaper and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express, in which he financial breaches in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first strip, saying it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published fake articles for money.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsty for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Cheney’s confessions, the New Express posted an apology on the first strip, saying the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several senior suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of making confessions in China remains widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to make self-determination.
U.S.-Mexico Drug Trafficking Tunnel With Its Own Railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities described the four-to-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
This tunnel, the zigzags of which make up the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with invisible warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unnoticed through it, the authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcers seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
In case of conviction, they threaten imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which put the drug cartels on a difficult task of delivering their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found an approximately 700-yard-long passage equipped with railroads that went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions are increased from November

The average age pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenses of the Fund for Social Protection of the Population of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with an increase in the budget of the subsistence minimum on average per capita.
BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - by 2.1% higher than in force in the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, by 2.1% from 1 November will be increased the size of minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and payments to pensions.

British police issue notification of extradition to Assange
British police delivered a notification on the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who hid in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian a "official request to surrender" with the demand to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement is not met, he will continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted his capabilities under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he hid in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “has handed over to a 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” the spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of release under bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. for allegations of espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic posts on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
Driver driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour with hot drinks between his legs is fined £1,000
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howe, 35, from Tiptrie, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Breintrie on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a beverage between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester, Howe admitted the accusation of driving without due caution and attention.
Adding seven penalty points to his driver’s license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howe was also obliged to pay a £90 fee and an additional £100 fee to help victims of crime.
A tax for foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a government duty rate of 7% for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
Currently, residential property duties in the districts of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceed the total in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Hamburg combined.
Mr Cook said: “After the increase in the state duty on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxing expensive real estate is underestimated regardless of the impact of an outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move may lead to some foreign investors reluctant to buy real estate in London or current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The price of premium real estate – the top 5–10 percent of the housing market price – in London’s rich southwestern belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
According to Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% in annual terms, but were overshadowed by an active “domestic market” with a surge in prices in the southwest, the north (7.4%) and the east (6,5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how a dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs twist their tail to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs twist their tail mainly to the left.
But now the scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tailwelling and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Valortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “It’s well known that people’s left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that in dogs, just like humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, both hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs’ diversified tails, the researchers watched animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We’ll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes turn in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Valortigara said, “We showed dogs videos – either naturalistic versions or a silhouette – to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that the nothing-expressing dog moved its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog whistling with its tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was mostly inclined to the left (again from the sight of the dog whistling with the tail), their heartbeat was accelerating and they looked alarmed.
Professor Valortigara said he doesn’t think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience which movements they should worry about and which ones do not.
He notes, “If there are several encounters with other dogs and frequently twisting their tail in one direction is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience.”
Researchers say these findings can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides matter for dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, he: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the tail of its tail was directed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite behavior of the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is sufficient evidence on different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes turn in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Cheffield band was scheduled to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
This statement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to move the show to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical care, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.”
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is unable to perform.”
The show will now take place at LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at Hydro will take place on November 21.

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals in the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and it is they who elect the Pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reached the age of 80 he can no longer participate in the papal election – this is the prerogative of a group of 120 “cardinals-elect”.
Announcing this news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all present cardinals, known as a consistory, would be held before the sanctuary ceremony.
“Pope Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero, from Catholic Voices, said the number of cardinals voters is likely to decrease by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals-elect to 120 again, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with looking for ways to reform the church.
In the past, he decided on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s all the first time for us.
Valero said the popes usually raised bishops from major parishes as cardinals, but Francis was “filled with surprises – so we don’t know who he would name.”
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine back seats
General Motors Co. is recalling 19,000 brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address problems with manual seat tilt adjustment, according to a notification from U.S. car safety regulators released on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, the back seats do not meet the federal safety standards of motor vehicles on headsets.
“When a vehicle is hit from the back, the headset may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Road Safety Administration’s website said.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The release of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into mass production for the leading U.S. automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notification to owners in connection with a 16-day government shutdown that reduced car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, grew by about 20 percent over the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to a mark of $37.47.
The shout of despair of Obama's voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to overthrow praiseful efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the website of the Obama-reformed healthcare system, drone attacks
The memoirs of the 2008 Obama campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathanie P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in the times of disappointment at the second grade of medical school and reawaken in me a sense of hope.
It’s called “Dare to Win,” and it’s memoirs about Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people, and speeches could have captured the spirit.
The election victory turned out to be impressive, and the head of news programs took a break to understand this historic moment.
My classmates wept of joy, and my parents kept every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he was supported by 82 percent.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a rough awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism – they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot, changes have really happened.
It was something I could not even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of the “don’t ask, don’t say” rule, and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public healthcare, and the closure of a base in Guantanamo, among others.
But after countless times I have been on the side of the Obama administration, defending it from colleagues and peers, I have exhausted the explanations I can provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to listen to foreign leaders or to attack innocent children in other countries by drones.
He cannot explain the National Security Agency’s gathering of data on the privacy of Americans or the prosecution of exponents exposing government illicit actions.
He cannot explain the murder of U.S. citizen Anvar al-Avlaki without trial and investigation, or the non-compliance with public funding and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
He can’t justify the report’s findings that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, he can’t justify not being able to develop a simple website for more than three years after the Accessible Healthcare Act was signed.
I don’t know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that the leadership could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, working for an elected post is not a predictable program of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by random events such as the Newtown beat.
Nevertheless, from all the examples I listed above, it is clear that they were largely the administration’s own choice.
And that is what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, seeming incapable of deciding on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressure of the upcoming elections, would justify the hopes we have heard of for so long.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much harder to go back to 2008 through this book.
This makes me grieve for many promises that have been failed.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the Pennsylvania primary elections.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of the failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
“I want us to get our attractiveness back,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnate, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when he was trying to get rid of questions about whether or not he had a conflict.
The United Party of Palmer can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in making a decision to abolish taxes on carbon emissions and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that there could only be a conflict of interest among ministers, and said Mr. Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, then he will have a direct interest in whether they get a leave or not," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the struggle for a seat from the Fairfax Sancheon Coast electoral district with a surplus of 53 votes after recounting.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting procedure in elections to accelerate this process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be made two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have such a system so that we could come in, enter our data in the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 18:30 the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencil marks in ballots.
Is it because they can delete the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Election Commission is exploring the possibilities for e-voting and has recently published a joint discussion document with New Zealand.
The 59-year-old Palmer said his program includes an international airport for Shaanxi Coast and he would take his new job “very seriously.”
Public office involves serving society.
“We are not seeking any rewards except the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its currency operations division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global regulatory check of alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly gaining turnover.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an ongoing investigation, which is reminiscent of the scandal associated with interbank LIBOR rate manipulation.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, informed individuals said that RBS transferred records of emails and instant messages received and sent by its former trader to the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Activity Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, he was given a vacation for his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
Mr Asher’s instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
UBS said this week it had taken measures against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators worldwide — the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust agency Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers had conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks scan instant messages and emails over several years in search of offenses.
The news of the checks has shaken traders in the field of activity, which has been one of the biggest sources of revenue for investment bank trading units in recent years, which this year, however, has faced difficulties due to the fact that the low volatility of currencies reduces favorable opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to mitigate the seriousness of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very small price.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange trading department traders this week after causing losses of $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Healthcare Law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s flagship health care law is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that separate provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act that require citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional in accordance with the government’s taxation powers.
Supreme Court Chairman John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also retained the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further ruled that the health law requirement that states increase compliance with the Medicaid program, otherwise they will lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutionally compulsory.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season strongly opposed the law, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is a cause?
In the State Duma in the framework of the “Open Tribune” politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because there are scandals and riots from this game.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politicians and the media should be correct in statements.
Probably he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the television shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with a clutch wire if they do not want to limit the birth rate there.
All the speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion a turmoil.
Maxim Grigoryev said that the events in Biryulev - "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "for these questions we are responsible for too many people and instances", and seven babysitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants, according to the public, has failed, and it is necessary to find its way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified history textbook.
"It is still necessary to create a guide on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for "calling for the split of Russia": "If in the United States say on the radio that you need to give Alaska to Russia, then you will be arrested and will be sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "burn up."
As usual, in everything he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: "In the dust of polemics, is there little to say!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "paper" and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then the same commitments can take on themselves and politicians.
We have approved about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he cited a law that puts the regional and municipal authorities in charge of interethnic peace in their territories.
But Lyudmila Andritchenko did not share the enthusiasm over this law: it does not have “clear ideas about what migrants’ adaptation is, about its mechanisms and limits.
Thus, subjects will interpret the extent of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel needed to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and the methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on National Affairs, Gadzimet Safaraliyev, proposed the creation of a special agency with the terrible name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar department, subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is sufficient to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without a portfolio", to whom you could turn, if anything.
“We are walking on the edge, the shells are rolling around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive worthy information support,” said the representative of the Russian Communist Party on relations with society, Vsevolod Chaplin.
No state neutrality in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious, should, in his opinion, be.
Here, Oleg Nylov led the discussion into an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan need to be sought, but they are pushed not on that road, not on that road," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades stone each other...
We don’t need that kind of football.
There is another sport called rugby.
"They will not be equal in the world in this kind of sport!" he said hotly.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
Give them a curling!
It is necessary to know the national characteristics, it is the same as Georgia "Zaporožec" to offer.
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves by wild behavior on the tribunes - during the game with the local club.
Football will be banned all over the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation Arthur Grigoryanc said that "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the House of Football correspondent "SE" Philip Papenkov.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for firing the flag of Dagestan by fans on the tribune during the home match of the 14th round against "Anji".
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We have examined all available materials.
For improper behavior of spectators "Kuban" is fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung and Huawei filed lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone makers, including Google, whose price it broke at a Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
Rockstar Consortium, which bought Nortel’s $4.5 billion patents, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match web search keywords with relevant ads, according to the lawsuit, which is at the heart of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in which transaction the determining factor was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt at auctioning the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated them and continues to violate them,” the court said.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
Egypt’s first freely elected president takes oath
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he swore to become the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black mantles in a court building on the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years of existence has been a banned organization that has been the target of the harsh actions of the interchanging governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small cortex shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered near the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak's time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to skip his car column along the usually bustling road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi has been mocked as a non-charismatic “backwheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday’s speech in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for the Islamists, but for all those who want to end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today, Egypt is a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told judges in the wooden hall where he took his oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, performing the national anthem, during which he stood on the stand "miraculously".
There was a military figure, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi.
His arrival was met with the slogan "Army and people are one hand", which was sung by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a fort of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became a fort of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and vowed to restore the president's powers, whom his post was deprived of by a military council that took affairs from the overthrown leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, not before the parliament, as it is accepted, he fulfils the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machinery Builders of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutovsky Automobile Factory.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Grybanov, in 2011, with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market of sales of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the factory and install the equipment for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of products were shipped this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Grybanov.
A new plant was launched in October, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the thermal-personal economy, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the production level of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will amount to about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is re-training personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from those already available.
In the coming year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal steel cutting with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another plant, with a speed of production of the pipe up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing and utilities.
The management of the enterprise sets the task of closing up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is aimed at forms of state support of industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of its leasing.
This year, 150 million rubles will be allocated for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider the subsidy agreements, receives documents from companies until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participating local producers in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in trade fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles of funds for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the motive for its introduction was compensation for the tax on mining, which the oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do this and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the region’s government considers direct support for industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders have expressed concern over the developing situation in relations with oil companies.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the industry of the southern Tyumen region, and if it is abolished, it will be difficult to compete in price with the middle band of Russia, where there is cheaper workforce.
In addition, it is unclear the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-BR - the company "Rosneft", which is not yet placing its orders on the Tyumen enterprises.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvatsky project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
At present, enterprises in the southern region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for next year.
The question remains whether the taxes on the oil produced in the Uvatsk region will be paid to the regional budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic to work 240 hours for extremist video on social network
The Leningrad district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work a resident of the city, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, a spokesman for the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page in the popular social network video, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Acts aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as to humiliate human dignity committed in public".
“The Leningrad District Court considered this case in a special manner and found the man guilty of committing the above-mentioned crime, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory work,” the spokeswoman said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians price collapse after signing association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will significantly decrease after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can say with certainty that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
After the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This will mean that prices will also go down.
"This is as far as goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should also be no price increases.
Therefore, reports on the billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that association with the EU is a rise in prices, it is not quite so, or if to be more accurate, it is not so," Azarov summed up.
Investigators verify information about child abuse in Biesk
On October 29, the media published a message that the teacher of one of the kindergartens of the city of Byiska for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Currently, the investigators are clarifying all the circumstances, as well as giving a legal assessment to the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation of bad news Evgeny Vasilyev spoke
Evgeny Vasilyeva, to whom the attention of the media has been attached for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press, both about the robberies in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and about addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the figure of the case "Obronservisa" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: "In the beginning, of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out of me any negative information about the former defense minister."
There was blackmail on the subject that I had to testify, otherwise I would be put in jail.
So far, those threats have ceased.
We will go to court to prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of the victory.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that, most of all, Vasilyev was given the words that she does not care about taste.
Probably, it refers to the statement of the official representative of the Russian Security Committee Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the figure of the case "Obronservisa", were found counterfeits.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic examination, appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings, established that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, are cheap counterfeits," Markin noted at the beginning of October.
Pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defense.
Then they still admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while saying that I have a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it’s just a mess,” says Vasilyev.
At the same time, when asked whether she acknowledged her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she was convicted of, Vasilyeva said: "Naturally, not.
Nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They just mislead people, that’s all.
In response to today's statement by the Russian Criminal Court that Vasilyev is avoiding studying the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the applicant said that he and his client "the investigator does not let him know the materials of the case."
What caused the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Per, how could a woman not fail to respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or were the journalists of Komsomolki right, who claimed a couple of days ago that she “falled into even greater trance under house arrest” because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the womb of the family?
The famous military researcher of the "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more conversational at interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyev was charged with illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.
The early trouble.

Do you think travel agents have gone back to the past because of the Internet?
In Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
This travel firm now expects its primary total annual pre-tax profit to range from $325 million to $340 million, compared to its previous forecast ranging from $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are reached, this will be a 12-17 percent increase compared to the record profit of $290,4 million in 2011/2012.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre received 8 percent profit in the first half of the year and started the second half with good results, especially on weekly trips in Australia and the UK.
“For the period since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high profits before interest and tax contributions for the full year,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure business went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Her U.S. business has compensated for losses during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to make profits for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.

The first was in the industrial district on the street.
At the time of inspection there was a game.
There were 24 machines in the club.
Another game club was found in the Leningrad district on Anton Petrov Street.
There were 20 slot machines.

In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, police are searching for a criminal who brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, on the eve in the Kirovsk district of the Ural capital after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The identities of the victims were soon established.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them was a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg, the second was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The burned apartment was removed a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
Internal affairs bodies work out various versions of murder, check the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented the apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom theyined relationships.
Schools are called to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School English literature courses will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British art literature since 1914.
The exam will also include “off-program text” to encourage more comprehensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
As of 2015, students will be required to take a separate language graduation exam, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due tomorrow to release new curricula in English and mathematics, the first subjects undergoing a radical revision.
He will make changes to other major subjects next year.
Separate regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure of high school graduation exams, with a new system of assessments and less volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public trust,” insisting that school graduation exams will be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time in the schedule of mathematics, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics, combined with an increased ratio in the rating table, would most likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training on the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-life tasks,” including financial mathematics.
Tickets in Heath will cost tourists at 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow, tourists will start driving ships on airbags.
For those who want to travel to China, this means extra expenses.
A ticket to the Puma is traditionally much more expensive than a heatboat.
As in the reference service of the company "AmurAsso", the cost of the regular ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
Traveling through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, in this season, tickets did not increase: at the same price, the pummies carried tourists last spring, and a year ago - in autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russian GDP growth is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that Russia’s GDP growth rate is insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending conditions and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
We planned a 3% GDP growth this year, maybe even a little more.
It will actually be less than 2%.
On the backdrop of a recession in a number of European countries it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a whole number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," he said.

Travel through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bouvelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Buelle is one of CNN’s top 10 heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to become the CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bouvelle saw his father come back to life and again fall unconscious, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Jaunda, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Buelle said.
If we had the money, we would have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” said Bowie.
“You can leave home at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
A lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Father Bwell died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroons could go to a doctor, many of them would not be in their pocket.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and three-quarters of healthcare spending in it is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwell said.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his countrymen, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bovelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a physician and works as a vascular surgeon at the Younde Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are loaded in vans, attaching medical supplies to the roofs and traveling through the crossroads to visit the village in need.
They are not always accompanied by luck.
Several times they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they are met as real heroes: it is a celebration with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason to celebrate, and Bwell with his wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on each trip,” Bwell said.
They come from all over the district within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get coffins, donated points, or free birth certificates—documents required for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, municipality or home building; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to free up space for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate operational and sanitary handling equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s a hard pace, but the brigade’s dedication usually helps support the country musicians.
“They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and continue to work,” Bwell said.
On Sunday, the members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This team, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students, conducted 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their help can be of tremendous importance to those they are helping.
One person explained that the free surgery he received to treat his hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical treatments on weekends and hospital work, the surgeon Bwell also works at night in private medical clinics around Jaunde.
This second work, he said, provides 60% of the funding of his non-profit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s asleep,” said Katie O’Malley, a doctoral student at Drake’s University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bowl.
He’s always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses such as O’Malley, coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bewell in his tasks, it’s an opportunity to practice that they’d never got at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood spots or hold instruments for Dr. Bowelle,” O’Malley said.
As a secondary student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Jaunda, their food, transport and training is paid by Bwell.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, being almost constantly busy with work is not a tough test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise given to his father is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bowelle said.
I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel's interrogation
Bundestag Deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, it was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Prosecutor General’s Office in the case of the possible intercept of the German Chancellor’s phone by the U.S. special forces.
Snowden has expressed willingness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
“He made it clear,” said Hans-Christian Strebele, “that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makai at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, reports the correspondent of BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the bodies of state administration of the two countries will provide ubiquitous assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves,” said Vladimir Makai.
He stressed that the Belarusian government will create all necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also said that the next 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, according to which the protocol was signed.
The sides developed a roadmap of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
“The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey view each other as reliable partners,” he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that at the talks the heads of foreign ministries of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, must be increased and brought to the indicator of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the sphere of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
The relations between our countries have always been very warm and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic ties and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” Davutoglu said.
Obama refuses to talk about health
Amidst a thunderstorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday went to the point of his often repeated, unambiguous promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notifications of cessation from their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama slightly reversed his initial public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Regarding what he called a “reanimation in the news” about the cessation of services, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it shouldn’t surprise anyone that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage doesn’t meet the new standards required under the Affordable Health Care Act.
“Let me say directly to these Americans, you deserve the best,” she said in a speech to the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Health Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been going “horribly badly” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
I want to regain your trust.”
Irritated Sibelius spoke the phrase, captured by the microphone on behind her by an assistant sitting in yesterday’s House hearings after a heated debate with House member Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, about whether she should join Obama’s healthcare program herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to explain why the “architect” of the Affordable Health Care Act has not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she is now imposing on millions of Americans.
"Rosbalt" agency deprived of media status for obscene bullying
On October 31, the Moscow city court ruled to invalidate the license for the registration of the Rosbalt agency.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact denying the publication the right to submit counterarguments.
What is “Rosbalt”
“Rosbalt Information Agency” was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representatives in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytics agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private internet media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still make up) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the entire existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was the fact that at the head of the project was Natalia Chaplin - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the leadership of "Rosbalt" is not entirely clear: most often she is called "the head of the project".
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief - Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" has not appeared in the ratings of federal media - neither by citation nor by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of visibility of Russian media sites according to the version of LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes about the helplessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and the joke", pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013 when amendments to the media law, which prohibited journalists from blasphemy, came into force.
The agency found a prohibited vocabulary in two videos published on the agency’s website (“Gigit of Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot defiled oil towers”).
The other parties describe differently.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the detected videos accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the media law and appealed to the court with the demand to take away the license from the agency.
"Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the department were unlawful: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the mother words in them were masked, and, third, immediately after the warning the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims in the world court - and when on October 22, 2013, the Moscow city court accepted Roskomnadzor's lawsuit, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th of the day, the peace judge made a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow city court - if you give up the thought that the outcome could have been predetermined earlier.
On October 31, the court ruled to invalidate the registration certificate of "Rosbalt", effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement on behalf of the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on 10 October was signed by 26 deputies; the document was submitted at the initiative of the KPRF).
On the unlawfulness of the closure of the publication stated the head of the Union of journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Council on human rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that until the withdrawal of the license the case will not come.
The Rosbalt court found: under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all claimed chemical weapons production capacities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has recognized.
This first phase of disarmament Damascus completed a day before the deadline.
By November 1, Syria had to destroy the production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisonous substances for use.
The destruction of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the toxic substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors headed to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time — to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons — and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent repairs.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing toxic substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly checked by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors on new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community has demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - destroy or put out of service all capacities for the production of projectiles, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of projectiles with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be to destroy the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisons, mushroom gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
In order to destroy it, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to first agree on a timetable of action - it is two weeks.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors “personally watched the destruction of equipment.”
“They now have no possibility of further manufacturing or mixing chemical weapons,” he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and determined that the shell and poisoning plants were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to be inspected there, the document says, but equipment from there has been transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons production infrastructure was "particularly difficult", as it had to work in the conditions of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, the time to celebrate this has not yet been found by the inspectors - they were too busy with the work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that U.S. espionage “has gone too far”
John Kerry demonstrated the softening tactics of protecting U.S. surveillance programs by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage has “goed too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on the autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden’s loud exposures about the NSA’s espionage activities.
These leaks of information put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on a video connection at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things happening on the autopilot, because such a possibility already existed – both during World War II, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, September 11.”
He then became the first senior U.S. government official to admit that U.S. espionage went too far, but stressed that no-one’s rights were violated.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted on good motives and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to explode themselves.
There is radical extremism in the world, irresponsible and determined to kill people, to blow up people, and to attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented aircraft crashes, buildings exploding and people killing because we were able to know about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had talked to MEPs and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to disappointment over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters in our joint counter-terrorism efforts," Democrat Murphy, who is in office for the first term and chairman of the Senate's European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview in Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone recordings across Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other disclosures included Snowden’s documents showing that the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended espionage against the Allies as necessary and said it was a normal affair on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this noise, Murphy said his office is organising a congressional visit, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating lawmakers are expected to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still in the development stage.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote the improvement of the relationship, he said that a certain degree of “hardness from the best motives” would also be shown.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activity,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the problems of hostility toward the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new compositions of public supervisory commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of public observation commissions (OPCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voted option is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
UNCs are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of imprisonment.
The cases of Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhaev, the unrest in the Copey colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents behind the roof are made public.
There is a struggle between human rights activists and lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP Working Group on the formation of the UNC, I proposed to make the selection criterion the experience of human rights activities.
"It was not accepted, and the lists were formed without developing the criteria," says Valery Borchev.
Borchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
In his time as a deputies of the State Duma from "Apple", he developed a law regulating the activities of the UNC.
The OP Council must vote on the compositions of the UNC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand candidates claim to 1800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the absence of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donation to vacancies.
Onc Moscow is one of the few commissions with the contest, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 will be 40 participants.
According to Borschev, in the current composition of the capital commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the variant, which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to get into the capital commission.
But in the new composition can re-enter the representative of the "Fighting Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the UNC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their Chairman of the UNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not rule out a collective exit from the commission.
In their opinion, the advancement of security forces is coordinated by the member of the UNC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officials of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the security departments.
“I don’t eat babies for breakfast,” said RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov.
He denies lobbying the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights activists from visiting arrested oppositionalists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list is currently voting in the OP.
He considers the publication of information as a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONC.
Her former managers will be removed due to last year's copee riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the UNC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists "disappeared" the human rights activist chairman of the local commission, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borchev considers "revenge for Kopeisk".
The disclosures of Hope Tolokonnikova did not affect Mordovia's ONC, which is considered "force": only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the contest.
The member of the council of the OP Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He forwarded his position to the other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The preparation of the lists was coordinated by Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Gryb, who is also an employee of the FSIN Research Institute.
Gryb told RBC daily that he does not think it is correct to divide the candidates into human rights defenders and security officials and does not agree that the chairs of the commissions have sufficient powers to hinder the work of its members.
Mr. Gryb does not take to predict the outcome of the vote of the council of the OP.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for false claims that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Roselle Bumford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 for filing a false lawsuit after Thailand’s police that a local taxi driver had carried out the assault on Sunday night, June 10, while two other men held her.
However, video surveillance cameras later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bumford for two days before admitting that they had fabricated the story.
Before the trial she was detained in local police chambers.
Bumford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a general regime prisoner detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a female adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tanks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about their daughter’s well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
"Obviously, it was an alarming time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bumford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand that Bumford is currently serving as a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court extending her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve a term in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, leading to an acquittal sentence.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
It is his novel that became the finalist of four awards: "Clear Pole", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "Big Book".
Last year, the author was awarded the Prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty- and forty-year-old prosaicists.
Almost every publication of his hard, built on modern life material of stories and novels causes hot controversy among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the articles gathered together on Senchin’s prose and publicity, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers", according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand under the word "literature", as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in the abbreviation in the sections "Abstract..."
