Barack Obama becomes the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to accept the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the fourth U.S. president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations, among other things.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time ever with the five members of the committee that selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple then have a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonia.
The visit will then culminate in a solemn ceremony in the afternoon, at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He'll be the fourth U.S. president to win the award, but only the third to win it directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be discussing the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president doesn't want to avoid this topic because he realizes he's taking the award as a president who is currently at war between two countries.
He's stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will fail to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He's planning to give it to charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The president's busy schedule will then lead to a banquet, which will include the King and Queen, the Prime Minister, and 250 other guests.
Obama has been rather reserved about the price from the start.
For example, he said that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeatedly stated that the prize was not just for him but for all who pursued the same values as he did.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that he considered it a "challenge to action".
Conservationists Accused of Blackmail
Litomerica police accused the president of the Litomerica Society of Conservation of Nature of blackmail.
In several cases last year, he appealed to certain construction procedures, withdrawing appeals and demanding money from investors for his benefit, Litomerica police spokeswoman Alena Romova said.
The chairman of the Litomerian Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody, facing up to three years in prison.
The class containers don't smell much.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their beverage containers, and in the villages of South Moravia, you will find sorting containers at every turn.
And in Brno?
There you can spare a few minutes before you find the appropriate dumpster.
I'm not saying that waste isn't sorted at all in Brno.
But I think that for being the second largest city in the republic, the council is not interested enough in this problem.
The problem is in the forestry league of sorting waste not only because we as citizens can still throw paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but also because of the number of dumpsters for such waste.
Have you ever tried downtown, for example, throwing a PET bottle in a wastebasket?
It's a bit of a hassle, but it takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I've found so far is on Moravian Square across from the Haunted House.
I don't want to be angry with Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but it's not a big deal.
Not to mention, there's no honey in the other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort.
It's just laziness.
They're a long way from the garbage dump.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans in sight on Kounic Street.
Luckily, I came across the right place on my way to the saline.
But the waste was overflowing.
After all, it's still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But ecology and some aesthetics don't seem to interest the Brno socialists.
They'd rather buy a hockey league that'll embarrass us all than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my guess with official statistics after a while of surfing the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
"Paroubkov" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left has given more to farmers and officials, despite the government's opinion, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or building savings.
But also for interest on the national debt or for international litigation.
This will add to the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janato.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for raises for some groups, they relied on the government to borrow extra on sensitive spending, pensions, or sickness. "It's just putting problems off for the future, laying mines", says Janota.
The money borrowed pays ever-increasing interest and must be repaid at some point.
The state has no choice but to take it.
If they don't cut social security or the cost of running the state, they have to raise taxes.
Everyone the left has added now: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later on, their children.
The pension or sickness benefits that have gone missing from their accounts, 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry about, they get them.
But at the cost of the state's increased debt, next year, the treasury will be short of not just $163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janotta, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it the cost of interest.
The government will need money to pay for it and it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT slightly or reduce the maternity pay, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Because of the money transfers to a few groups of voters, there will also be a five billion shortfall next year for the construction of highways and railways.
These are mainly already selected and laid out sections which cannot be re-designed and possibly discounted.
At most, it's preserved, which is not free either.
This means delays or stoppages in 30 major construction projects, and the drawing of European money is also at risk, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The Czech Social Democratic Party proposed that the money shortage be solved by a shalamunism  by drawing on the dividends of the Czech Republic, which the State owns in the majority, and contributing to the transport fund.
The problem is, the dividend is never certain, and it's not a bottomless resource.
Last year, the Czech Republic's budget was 18 billion.
Each year, dividends are paid to clean up environmental damage, to supplement the pension account or to serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
But the carnival of moves does not end there.
Nearly three billion dollars were cut in the budget for various types of compensation for victims of communism and crime, for legal expenses, and even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, Janota says.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the department or, in the worst case, tap into the government's budget reserve.
Another $100 million is missing from the already-launched two-billion-dollar Treasury project, which is designed to allow online monitoring of government spending.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janot.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems.
Americans expect a mobile phone in the future, where the user can switch between different operating systems with the press of a single button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just one keystroke, you can go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is the objective of VMware, a US company that focuses mainly on developing virtualization software for computers.
We're going to allow you to have two user profiles on your phone at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It'll be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to the press a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM running Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new mobile phone technology is in full swing.
VMware is currently working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization and should be available to customers in 2012.
A lack of snow in the mountains is troubling hoteliers
Naked slopes aren't just a concern for the crow's-feet.
The lack of snow is discouraging people from even booking ski stays at hotels and guesthouses.
That's why there are still rooms available in Krkonoše for all winter terms including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of traffic on our site.
People are looking at offers, finding out prices, but they're still afraid to make a commitment.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or on mud", said Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve at the Spindler Mill exactly as you want, you should stop hesitating to order.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of their accommodation is second, may try to wait a few more days.
Spindler's hotel chain is currently offering only weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to turn them in for a while, but then they'll let them go for a shorter time.
And then the empty rooms will be rapidly shrinking", estimated Yandura.
The top-rated travel agency Ingtours still offers beds free of charge on all winter terms.
Now, what we're most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
Half the seats on our offer are still open.
That is why we have already arranged some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays,' said Petr Schiefert, Director of Ingtours.
New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, the Vrchlab travel agency can offer more, but there are fewer places.
Sales are good for the first two weeks of February, with average sales for the rest of the winter.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if he'll come up with something.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will be sold out", says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the hotel's rooms are a little better than last year's at the Horizon Hotel in the Furnace Under the Snow.
We're about five percent better off.
We have a few last places for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest in the Polish holidays in January and sales are good in February", said Karel Rada, director of the best bakery hotel.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also occupied by the Omnia Hotel in the central parking lot in Janský Lazní.
On the other hand, at Christmas, half the beds in the newest hotel in Janskolaza remain free.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by January, which we have now occupied by about 60 percent.
February is a little weaker, but once the snow hits, interest in staying in the Krkonoše will certainly increase, said Omnia hotel director Erik Sporysch.
But for now, Krkonoše hoteliers must let their appetite run out for the more snow.
It's supposed to be cooler on Thursday, so if there's any rain, there should be snow on the mountains.
But then warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute reported.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's funny how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, is trying to repeat the strategy of his predecessor, whom he thought was the dumbest, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally swallowed his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it over a copy machine from Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the wording "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he didn't even hesitate to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward".
He himself, three years ago, criticized Bush's idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and disastrous in its consequences".
But the following months showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only one possible and so successful that today, Iraq is not even mentioned in the news.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, but left his successor objectively in a much more grateful starting position than one might expect.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, most notably the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the hesitant snipers in the White House, despite his subordinate habits.
He asked for 40,000 men to turn the situation around.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general out of 10,000 troops.
He managed to squeeze another 5,000 from Europe, even though he had originally counted on at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish the process in three years.
Many doubt that the half-increase will produce the same results as the Iraq process.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are being respected.
The Afghan security forces are ill-prepared for these conditions, used to changing their masters every day as they see fit.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain a mere village of potatoes, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to thrive.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the ambiguity of the situation, which is further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the building of an "accessible state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem very realistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy is striking in its voluntarism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse, and now it's on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the heat of war for the purpose of "coming home soon" will cause the miracle performed here can only be a soul truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is a blatant irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect acknowledgement of American defeat.
The recent NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is on the decline.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that could radically affect the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the intensified sanctions on Iran fail, the United States will face the overwhelming question of whether to try to resolve the problem by military force.
It will be answered just as Obama says America is moving to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution would also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election, and therefore there is still plenty of time to come up with another strategy if this one turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer be paid in cash
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash compensation this year.
The company announced this in response to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top executives will receive stock instead of cash, which will be available for sale in five years at the earliest.
In addition, the shares may be taken away from the managers if they are over-risk.
Goldman Sachs is leading the way in linking Wall Street's reward with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to go, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire for setting aside nearly $17 billion in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The company's total earnings for the year, according to Reuters, are expected to exceed $20 billion despite the measures announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector became a hot political topic in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it would impose a one-time 50 percent tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
A record five women took this year's Nobel Prizes in literature and in the professional categories from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm today.
Besides the four scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
The prize in chemistry went to Ada Jonath, an Israeli, along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, an American, for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom, an American, and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only subject that didn't get a winner this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to Charles Kao for his research in optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial merit.
The amount of the aid is SEK 10 million (approximately CZK 25 million) for each category.
If there are more honorees in each, they split the prize among themselves.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he is leading a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defense of his policy, he added that wars are in some circumstances necessary to win peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janato is considering resigning.
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's continuance in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said that the deficit was too high, which further exacerbated the public finance crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janoto wants to discuss his continuation in office with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget bill that Klaus will now get signed, the Czech Republic should be managing a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals for money transfers and increased money for civil servants' salaries, running social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has accused the Social Democracy proposals of covertly increasing the budget deficit.
This has led to a sharp internal political dispute between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, and has raised questions about the future of Fischer's cabinet, which was formed in the spring by the ODS, the CSDP and the Greens.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the austerity package that the Fischer government implemented in the autumn, which it says is to stop the state's indebtedness.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, told a business breakfast discussion today that politicians have been neglecting a "serious problem" for a long time, namely the "unsustainable deficit" in public finances.
He says he doesn't have a good solution anymore.
Only a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, could bring about improvements, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should consider another existence.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas told CTC that the concept of the civil service cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer in response called such words "strong statements".
The head of the Czech Socialist Republic, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánka by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topolánka government prepared for this year is frightening and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSDP declared the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's News.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some critics saying that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that the 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could play him in an Eastwood film.
Another major role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, 'If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in the Eastwood box-office drama Million Dollar Baby, has played, for example, the leader of the abolitionist movement who eventually became a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even the god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman served 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is Latin for undefeated, and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country, and the newly elected president Mandela knows that his nation is still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are globally outsiders.
South Africa will finally qualify for the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
"I had no other goal than to play this role in a way that brought it as close to reality as possible", Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to become someone else.
Matt Damon plays Francois Pienaar, captain of the white-dominated national rugby team.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was finally when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the marked differences in the cast from their actual prequels under the direction of Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and there is talk of Oscar ambitions.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film".
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive ratings.
The secret of the glow over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway, a strange light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only yesterday admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian military, is slowly becoming a black mark of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in rocket tests had no effect on the success of the test flights.
The buffalo usually didn't take off at all or got damaged in the air.
The Russian newspapers are already talking about the Bulava as a "missile that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th attempt in a row was initially normal.
It was not until the end of the flight that the aircraft suffered another technical failure.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, the Bulava took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was floating under the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a moving vessel while submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a nearby unidentified flying object was indeed disturbed by the Bulava.
Besides, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile from the start.
The generals are defending themselves this time, saying that there is no unambiguous word for failure.
The first two stages of the missile survived, and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines failed in the first degree.
Although not a single test launch was completely flawless, only six of the 13 were deemed by the Department of Defense to have failed.
The generals are optimistic about the nearly 50 percent success rate, so they still claim that the Bulava will one day fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract at the age of 51 with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again be in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow in a crisis and will probably start in the KHL match against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formal business, the AP quoted Moscow coach Sergei Nemchinov as saying.
It's not clear if the famous hockey player's comeback will be a one-game series.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said Nemchinov.
Fetisov would be the oldest Russian professional hockey player, according to the AP, if he were to return to the ice.
In the NHL, he played the entire season for Hartford legend Gordie Howe at age 51, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetis, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the latter part of his career, he also had success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in Detroit.
He's been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has agreed to the unions, they're canceling all overtime.
The management of the Hyundai Motor Company in Novorossiysk has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the frequent overtime orders that the unions declared a strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the union on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign our production plan, it is essential, therefore, a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts, Vaněk said.
The server of Seven.cz wrote that the company of employees who work the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
They can either get paid overtime or choose a day off on December 28th, extending the Christmas holidays by one day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive paid travel and lunch.
Since overtime was the most urgent and most acute point in terms of the comments and complaints of the trade unionists and protesting employees who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, car-manufacturing workers were forced to work two hours of overtime each day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will lift the strike alert.
The next meeting between the management and the union is scheduled for Friday morning.
The union chief, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation in the auto industry escalated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management objected that employees had to work overtime to meet demand for car deliveries.
In their Monday strike alert, the union also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the unions are demanding that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
Plus, they're offering a reward of 5,000 crowns for it this year.
The Hyundai automobile company in Noshi now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production last November.
As of September this year, it has produced about 80,000 cars, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that even deals with 'infected' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works against viruses that have already gained immunity to the drugs.
This fact is in some cases overridden by the fact that the compound for the common variant of the virus does not work as strongly as some of the drugs already available.
AIDS is not curable yet.
However, a combination of medicines that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body can significantly prolong the life of patients.
However, there are a number of side effects associated with their use.
In addition, incomplete suppression of the virus's reproduction results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to tackle resistance to the virus.
They showed that substances called metal carburanes act on a protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metal carbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way that no other drug is currently used, and so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists are coming up with new "enhanced" compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metal carbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, the mature infectious virus particles would not be produced.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, explain scientists in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the researchers describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is then systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The efficacy of this series of anti-HIV protease agents was tested in a laboratory and also against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metal carbores on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modification make metal carbores interesting compounds for further research aimed at designing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is on to Fischer, he's fighting back.
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, called the approved budget for next year "terrifying" and said Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider a further existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statement as strong.
He said he's keeping time for analysis.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of a civil service cabinet with the support of the CSDP, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Nečas pointed out.
The House on Wednesday passed the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, for running social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's advantage over the Social Democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, thus complying with the Government's wishes that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would assess the current situation further.
Nečas believes that if he had seriously threatened to remove Janot from office if the amendments were adopted, the situation could have been different.
According to Czech TV, Janoto made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering continuing in office.
It's his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer is in favour of further fighting the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the nominees of the CSDP, which has implemented the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes any other deficit-increasing legislation, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the Employment Act.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by the ODS are not guilty
It's a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who report to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Neime stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of fighting the high deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
But then he can't count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's relevant, I'll deal with it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS has backed down.
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the PM of the Civic Democrats had not explicitly requested that they allow the budget to be passed.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS did not suffer from the absence of the party chairman in parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
I knew when I gave up my mandate that the next few months would be about the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of everything positive, responded Topolánek himself.
Under the new rules, the Czech Republic will have fewer trains for almost the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech railways will cancel or limit some less busy expressways and routes, while other links will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from the date of entry into force of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will remain unchanged.
More connections to the capital will be available, for example, to residents of Ostrava, with the railways adding one set of pendulums to the route.
The express will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer expressways will also be operated on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route, and the direct Prague - Letohrad connection will be substantially limited.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in traffic in the Královéhrade region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can expect an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovice have to change at Lysé nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
The Czech Republic will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
The commute to Bratislava has been suspended since December 13th.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport is quickly ordering and paying, and will pay the roads for the so-called demonstrable losses next year, as well as this year, a total of four billion crowns.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The newly concluded 10-year contract for both local and express services, which has been for one year, is now in force.
The roads are happy with the system, which is why they seem to have failed to raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only apply to one-day network tickets ČD Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of the eLiška will be based on the distance travelled, previously it was uniform for travel between any regional cities and was 160 crowns.
Philippine armed forces still hold more than 50 people, children released
Gunmen in the southern Philippines today kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 gunmen are reportedly using hostages as human shields to escape from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially pursued the kidnappers over violence that required settling scores between two local family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern Philippines province of Maguindanao in response to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre in connection with the gubernatorial election were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential Ampatuan tribe, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman, alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood, Invictus, will be released in theaters in the United States, which will feature a portion of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was taken by Morgan Freeman, who was reportedly chosen by Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago.
The male supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaire, was played by Matt Damon.
The film's release has been met with both critical and public acclaim.
Nelson Mandela is here.
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, as he was known, was born on July 18, 1918, in South Africa's Mveshu.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The report is highly anticipated, as it comes at a time when South Africa is at the height of preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media is shaken by alarming reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP, the reviews of the new film in the JAR are generally positive for now, despite numerous reservations about casting "professional" Hollywood stars in the lead roles.
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of his new film.
I've been dreaming about this role for years and I've been preparing well for it.
I also met many times with Nelson Mandela personally to, as they say, draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can use the film to remind people of Mandela's personality and message.
It is the story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
Based on the book by British author John Carline, loosely translated as The Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, the film portrays a South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to establish two racial and for many years mutually defined population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey at the World Cup field, which JAR won at that time.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which is almost considered sacred in the R.A.R., Mandela won a huge standing ovation from a predominantly white audience 14 years ago and won the respect of the white population.
Football may be able to bring people back together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in the JAR will improve is yet to be seen.
But white South Africans are skeptical, as revealed in a recent LN interview by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformator burning in the Lounsch is worth tens of millions of crowns.
The fire broke out this morning in the transformer of the company Cheps in the power plant near the village of Výškov in Lounsko.
The fire is being fought by six units, according to the spokesman of the Ustech regional fire brigade, Lukasz Marwan.
The fire department originally wanted to let the transformer burn out, but later reconsidered and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing agent.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured, and the accident did not threaten the safety of the transmission system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandata.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be possible to calculate it exactly after the fire is over.
The mandate says the damaged transformer will need to be replaced.
In the ten years of Ceps' existence, nothing like this had happened, and defects of this type were rare, she added.
According to ČEZ spokesperson for the northern part of Czechia Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, the electricity supply was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or companies was not affected by the fire.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution lines with 67 transformers that transfer electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and 4339 kilometres of transmission lines.
Jancura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three Czechoslovak chieftains
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three Social Democratic leaders.
And that is Michal Hašek from the South Moravian region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice region and the chieftain of the Olomouc region Martin Tesárek.
Janchura said it in 20 Minutes on Radio.
The action concerns the company's attempt to operate regional rail services in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term agreements with Czech Railways.
All three chieftains are attacking us, talking about picking raisins, when we only brought in the offer of what they wanted.
They say we're more expensive than the Czech railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against the Student Agency, he told Radio Janskura.
He also stated that he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hashek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be another continuation of Mr. Janchura's media show, which serves as unpaid publicity for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and that of my country, and I urge the other chiefs to do the same.
I assume that this will also make it clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public with false and false arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, said Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising to warn of the unfavorable move by the provinces.
He told the radio magazine that he's going to stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year's.
He clarified that the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and did not tender for the order of about 150 billion crowns.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
He said that a member of the Czech Socialist Party had threatened Jančur because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CPSU, I know who he is, but I won't say his name, he told Radio Janskura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination from January will break the old ways.
It's supposed to be the first one for families, free and optional.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are at a peak.
The FDA is already setting the maximum price for vaccines that health insurers will pay.
Experts are also clear on the vaccination process.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on or after 2 August last year can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they haven't had a single dose of the vaccine.
Those who started vaccinating last year or earlier must pay for their own re-vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumonia.
The parents paid $1,500 for one dose or more.
Four doses are needed for vaccination of young children.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between $300,000 and $500,000 a year on vaccinations.
But it saves on the treatment that children without vaccines would need.
Up until now, the state has been paying for all the vaccinations for children, about $500,000 a year.
The vaccination package was introduced by the Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the cerebral cortex and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections in our country kill up to 28 children under the age of 10 in a year, according to hospital research.
In addition to the Czech Republic, paid area vaccination against pneumococcal diseases has been introduced in some 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, however, there are suggestions that this vaccination may become mandatory in the future.
It's supposed to be paid for by insurance companies from January and it's optional.
For example, the head of the civil society association, Rudolf Kalovsky, suggested that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference our association attended were not entirely satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in doing this.
I think that's the path we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
But the Ministry of Health doesn't want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
We're not thinking about it at all at the moment, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its downsides, say doctors
The president of the Society of Professional Pediatric Practitioners, Hana Cabrnoch, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, reducing the number of overvaccinations could be considered. "With the high cost of this vaccine, we understand the political decision to start vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumonia by next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first mass vaccination of children to be paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving for further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy their own drugs
But that's where the concerns of the practical pediatricians come in, which is about buying vaccines.
The original plan was for the vaccines to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors to receive them in the same way that the government supplies them with the ingredients for other vaccines.
However, some MEPs feared that this could lead to insurance companies "withdrawing money from health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy drugs and wait for the insurance company to pay them.
It is estimated that individual pediatric practitioners will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy, Cabrnoch says.
Son of an American artist 'steals from museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy writer Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his car and trailer.
A man named Mr. Frazetta and another man used a bagr to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a long-standing family feud.
Before police, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, made a sworn statement that he did so at his father's direction "to get into the museum by any means possible and move the paintings to the sweetening rooms", the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta Sr. denied any such permission as the agency claimed.
Labour opposes planned tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories have "missed" the opportunity to show they are serious about postponing deficit reduction decisions until after the election.
Even the chancellor has come under fire for disabling low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, the main points are an increase of 0,5% in social security and a 1% adjustment in public payments from 2011.
Anger over Social Security
The unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they did not blame, and warned of "problems" in advance.
Social security is rising - an increase of about £3 trillion a year - which has angered the business community, who have said that it is a tax on employment, while the focus should be on restoring the economy.
This increase, limited to those earnings above £20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
The following information shall be provided:
Social security will increase by a further 0,5% from April 2011
Economic situation deteriorates more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers ' bonuses
Increase of 1% in corporate tax for depreciation of small businesses
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind power plants
Increase in the pension allocation by 2,5%
According to the government's estimate, some £30,000 incomes will be reduced by £90 a year, and some £40,000 incomes will be reduced by £190, while some £10,000 incomes will increase by £110.
Ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall on the top 5%.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts would be a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would need to be done.
"These are big numbers, and they will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms stated that he was convinced that the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But the forecasting of future economic growth - which will affect the amount of borrowing needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise past amounts.
In his opinion, he said the economy was down 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April - because loans were £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
A missed opportunity.
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" for Labour, have called the planned £789bn loan over the next six years untenable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan for how to compensate, they added, "cynically" postponing this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything substantial that could be done", said Shadow Chancellor Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it".
"All important announcements will be made after the election, if we win it".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and the other two.
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tories' proposals, who would like to reduce the deficit faster and on a larger scale.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said that timing of the announcement - for example, inflation will rise and there will be a default on benefits next April - could lead to the chancellor being blamed in an election campaign if the money is hardly recovered a year later.
But Labour insists on special assistance if people need it badly and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspicious budget
While ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that reducing public spending would be just the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The prestigious Institute for Budgetary Studies has said that the Chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the future.
"It's really very painful so far", said its director Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election, if we win", added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte's accounting officer.
"It was a suspicious budget report, the markets are implementing it".
FBI conducts investigations into 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a Pakistani prison into five Americans suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargodha in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing last month at their residence in the US state of Virginia.
The US State Department said it was also seeking information on these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry, and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been briefed on the arrests and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities here and whether they are indeed missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at the home of one of their uncles.
It stated that the house had always been the focus of local police interest and that no charges had been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that is advancing recruitment and training".
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was reported by their families in late November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranian oppressors.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details the "methods of torture" used by the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied the above criticism of the report on human rights.
Officials have labeled this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were imprisoned and dozens killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were arrested, and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC's John Leyne in Tehran, now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had declared some forms of torture unlawful and banned them from being carried out at the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the law has been tolerated, our correspondent noted.
False confession
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer engineering student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"They often beat me in the face", he said in his testimony.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... threatened me with death and humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half-unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Senior Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that torture was involved.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks at Kahrizak Prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-riots unrest and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the findings of the parliamentary committees were not made public.
The group said at least 90 people have been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn the Bristol Memorial into a race track.
The ski slope for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump bridge in front of the 100-foot ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was truly depressing.
It was a beautiful view of the twinkling lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents", he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces or maneuvers on the downhill.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minarets and alarming reports were being spread about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and reported and pondered whether Muslims could integrate - and do integrate - into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, Why the French Don't Like Headclothes (2006), an elegant and debated study of the controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose impact is still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious outlook.
As a good anthropologist, I want to know not only what the politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that now care for the 5×6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He's a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Does a Muslim have the right to use the interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular issues that are debated and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media occupies.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others widely known figures, including Tariq Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no argument for all their customs.
Conservatives are suspicious of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen tend to believe that this is an anti-Selafi group - purist Sunni Islam, based in Saudi Arabia - a small group that influences European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromise on both sides.
He questions how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, which so stubbornly defends the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who have also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he discovered "the tightening of the screw of values".
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book, some may be inclined to say, "Yes, but not now".
The Most Disappointing Prospects in the World
The Arctic is changing faster, more dramatically than the rest of the planet's ecosystems.
The boundary ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In "On Thin Ice", author and illustrator Richard Ellis describes the natural history of the iconic North, the polar bear.
Well-versed in the complex history and practices of whaling, he describes the long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musket ball is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their mothers who have just been killed were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, 75 polar bears were performing in a circus tent at one time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are typically a million times smaller than the area available to an adult in the wild.

Mr. Ellis draws on the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
While hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis, all armed with powerful assault rifles to shoot their prey.
The irony is that it's happening in the waters north of these two hunting nations, and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomfortable account of science's responsibility for the Arctic and a compelling glimpse into how the future may change it.
Not everything is answered by scientists.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers have no adequate answer to the speed of change.
That's for lack of rehearsals.
Fridtjof Nansen's exploration voyages in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested how floating ice moves.
Cold War submarines then mapped the moving precincts as they sailed underneath them.
Satellite surveying and a large field of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much is still being done by intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinarily fragile world of the falling system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that is frozen and shrinks as it freezes.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic wonders of the sky, it's all doomed to extinction once the summer ice moves, which will happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... that could be us.
6,000 Marines laid wreaths on the graves of Arlington
Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, we'll be on board, and it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, to show me the respect that I'm trying to show.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veterans' cemeteries in several departments at a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, started the tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a memorial service in Arlington.
Now, it's an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. Morrill and his wife Karen make this trip every year, stopping in various towns along the way to honor the memory of military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters don't look for profit, crowns across America, which they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon, the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and ship wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington to honor her late husband, a member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that this was her way of giving back what she sacrifices.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting the family grave.
Covered in warm cloth, the volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older World War I, World War II and Vietnam war graves because they're not as frequently visited as newer ones
The atmosphere was positive as the children played and held hands as they transported the young pine to the worn-out headstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arch at the top.
Near Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there has been a real silence.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the wars that were just taking place filled the area.
Some were weeping sincerely, others praying, and families and friends were holding each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others bent over to see the small black-and-white names printed in the wet mud where the headstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes at their son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of heavy artillery sergeant David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. My son paid for it, she did.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one who remembers him".
American government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was importing cell phones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, were seeking access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Specific charges were not disclosed, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical statements, risk imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. Sanchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept the prize, but she was denied permission.
The detention of the American supplier may be a result of the growing tension between the Communist Castro brothers, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been viewed as a "deterrent tactic" in improving relations with the island.
First to report the arrest was the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average government employee's salary is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for texting, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a day's wages.
Internet access on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to apply often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
An American arrest in Cuba is a rare occurrence.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for criminal offenses such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide any more information about the prison.
The imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Activities like this, which would be legal in any other open society - let's say free cell phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. program for a human rights advocacy group, which recently published a negative report on Cuban freedoms called "The New Castro, That Cuba", in reference to the installation of Raúl Castro as the country's leader and replacement for his disgraced older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He stated that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries move toward a more comprehensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday unmasked the alleged leader of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters who spy on the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment approving of terrorist attacks on the YouTube video website.
Saifullah took the lead on these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, trying to help them get into the remote area of Pakistan in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But the Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were confined for several days to the eastern district of Sargodha, far from the dreadful mountains to the northwest, which had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The reason for the suspension was stated by an official who spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five - who remained in Pakistan and were interrogated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, in determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence community has given the highest priority to efforts to place human resources with al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as sentries, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be intelligence.
Fake American recruits were subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential access to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious about who they allow to access them in recent years because U.S. intelligence agencies have acquired experts on their recruiting methods.
If we try to penetrate these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has been followed so much?" said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched into the streets on Saturday, demanding more action on climate change from negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters reported many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police reported the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists planted several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the minor incident at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners that read in English "This is not Planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish that said "Earth Says 'Enough.'"
Several celebrities participated in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother's native Peru and provided information about the dire state of the country, which is still suffering from the effects of climate change.
That's part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to world leaders to come forward with a fair, ambitious and binding deal", she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the Bell Center and said they detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one non-participating viewer, who did not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talk, activists masquerading as athletes and wearing black suits have planted several bombs near the Copenhagen Main Canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, firing torches, but then followed by "several large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably didn't get to the attention of key officials like Su Wei, China's top climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of".
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the stage is so big, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He watched to see if the walk was painful or helpful depending on each person's prospects.
There is a focus on the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is an interference with the conduct or freedom of other persons.
The test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week's federal certificate of mathematics achievement was a welcome element of good news for the District of Columbia public school system.
While the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the test showed greater progress among fourth- and eighth-graders in the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Center for Accreditation of Teaching Progress is the persistent disparity in learning achievement between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in the District of Columbia has increased over the past two years from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but for their African-American peers, it has increased only by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge achieved actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
African-American eighth graders remained largely flat, with a statistically insignificant one-point gap from 245 to 245.
The average score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the next six years is not exactly encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results of the children in both groups improved during this period, the difference was barely approaching 58.
Some advocates for education in the district have expressed themselves in the past week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) have been more widely stimulated in white students where they already had high scores.
That would indicate that we've increased the total support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal pay in the county.
I'm not jumping up and down for a two- or three-point diversion, said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often critical of Ms. Rhee's administration style, Ms. Brown said that reporting the test results means the city's high school system is in a desperate state and demands attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the decks, and I respect that.
But the sad thing is, we didn't spend nearly as much time and energy as we needed to spend on our high school education.
Mrs. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at upper-grade elementary school students and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their careers significantly lag behind their peers.
The daily math and sixth grade math curriculum, highlighting games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former principal Clifford Janey can be credited to the progress of the NAEP that was reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and do our best to intervene on those students who remain below the level of the classroom, said Mrs. Rhee.
Others said that the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources to low-performing schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It's a certain convoluted dilemma for Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the poorest parts of the District of Columbia.
So the focus can bring political echoes that are directed against an important agenda.
But the blame goes to other city councillors who are trying to keep the white-black ratio even.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, wherever they live, can be confident that their children will be provided with an excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make the schools eligible.
You need to get up to 200 days to implement the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers' association last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a "signal" for seeking a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
A coach came into Gettysburg Railroad with a loud sigh.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and paused for a moment on the white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracieli's parents had a hard time graduating from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never set foot on the railroad tracks.
Now she and the other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their status was rather than the intimidated visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? She was being thoughtful when they told her about the low student-to-professor ratio.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day tour, and now they were completely engrossed in the message ahead: It's not a question of whether you're going to college.
The question is, where did it come from?
This is a big problem, of course, with the high number of children born in the United States to Spanish immigrants who are expelled from college or who get pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands who get a secondary education and enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "heavy generation" of Spanish high school students - remarkable results that indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, arrived in the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of departure for a generation that played a marginal role in the country's workforce.
Those who have achieved a college education say they have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play a vital role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to attend college - especially if these efforts are sustained.
Given that children come from low-income groups, whose parents lack the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every point will not solve the problem, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school safety net with all the means to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's railroad tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million annually to local school systems to launch readiness programs that start for low-income students in high school and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than % of whom have entered college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Oil Industry has reached an agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their faultless infrastructure in two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in reviving Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies have gone out with equity stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one made a losing bid.
Two American companies have reached an agreement on the field, which was auctioned off in June.
The stealth involvement of American oil giants in Iraq's open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That'll be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by the massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the US military, are likely to deter US companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has proven to have the third largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
US firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only US companies to enter into agreements with the Ministry.
Leading American companies like Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and offered technical assistance in the past years, have gone empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the largest shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. has participated in more bids for contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum Industry.
We believe that the Chinese company will be competitive and meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the Ministry on the basis of the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay to reinforce the output above the current level in each field.
A top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaeda operational planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their vehicle in the neighbourhood near the town of Miran Shah in the province of Sevran Vaziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have claimed that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in the illegal Indian tribal areas.
They were listed on a white car heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, said an official with the Pakistani civilian intelligence agency who phoned from Miran Shah.
The official said that local armed men rushed to the spot and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said the Somali was poisoned to death.
Somali was reported to be a senior al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed terrorist groups' operations outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the worldwide buildup, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If he was in such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was receiving instructions from the highest level of Al-Qaeda and using them to plan possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somali was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure to some Americans, but he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose for us and our allies, another official said.
As of September 2015, he was the second senior leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed in a similar attack, killing Najmudin Jalolov, a leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operative leaders.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has dropped since the summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to records from Long War, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing individuals they suspected of being informants, the website said.
The UN High Commissioner in Kabul has resigned.
The UN High Commissioner for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's UN-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure is happening because the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase but expressed concern that the US timetable for de-escalation, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel helping in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the armed forces side must be copied on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a report with the UN.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and formerly headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhem, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan has been tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral rigging.
Eide denied these claims, but said that the accusation of Galgraith - who was fired - "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism regarding international interference" in the election.
Eide said he was suggesting a meeting with the top citizen representative to coordinate efforts to ease the lead of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to lend to the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations on her efforts in Afghanistan and said that the tough UN hiring regulations undermine her ability to use the skills.
The UN rules are such that I've only been able to get one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a weeklong tour of war-torn areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said that a "package of incentives and prohibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" from the sanctions.
According to a statement released Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will face serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Security Committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for urgently needed reactor fuel for medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be backing away from the interim agreements - in part, says one expert, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community on some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think it's brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together on a path that's not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to seeking other options including surveillance, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the UN on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and baseless accusations" made to some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, especially over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to avoid delaying US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to quell Kurdish concerns about the ongoing depression, and U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you".
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One more child is one more grave".
Then they learned that when the official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
"We didn't leave anything for others", says Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an eight-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old one-child policy has produced two generations of notoriously bulky and deformed children affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", threatening the country with a population crisis.
The average birthrate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the population aged 60 and over is projected to grow dramatically from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with a population of higher education, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said that many couples have to have children to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the size of the labor force in the future".
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- as in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradual calming
As inserted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever introduced under Communist Party rule.
Couples who violated the policy faced hefty fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials have promoted policies that have helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned for their policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to have an abortion when they had their second child.
In addition, many couples have had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of males to females.
In past years, population officials have been progressively more moderate in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, universities generally allowed exceptions - including urban dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were single - and in 2007 they relaxed the dictation of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the ordinance detailing how a second child would be eligible and how to apply for permission.
The city sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and place leaflets under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
The Sad Reaction
Although officials in one rural town near Shanghai noted an increase in couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, most city districts did not report changes.
Huinan City District, for example, with a population of 115,000, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai's Caol City, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people did not want more children.
They want to provide the best for their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they wanted to have two children and were legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, who just don't have enough government-provided health and life insurance.
Without a docile retention network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources manager, says that they only want one child because she too was an only child: "We were the focus of our families, and everyone cared for us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we didn't really want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, expressed it more candidly.
For middle-class, two-career parents who have cut their birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year-olds view their parents as the early days of China's experiment with capitalism, and they don't want that way of life for themselves, he says.
One child is making enormous demands on his parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of the poster -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategies -- "You have to have a resume ready by the time a child is nine months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We're the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN team has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unproven stance and mutual blame -- focused again on Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with the industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the burden in the short term.
The text, which may provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there was important progress in the negotiations, which were timed at the wrong time with over 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by an ad hoc UN task force, this text quietly states how much money rich countries should give to poor countries to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of options for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global warming should be that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior executive of the Sierra Club of Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, a 180-page condensation of the text of the negotiations to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement whereby industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by the year compared with 1990 levels, while the major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union negotiated swiftly on Friday a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt climate change adaptation -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday brought up the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated interviews last week.
US Special Envoy on Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries compared to voluntary in major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signalled that the Obama administration had taken a tougher line on China than Bush administration officials had just two years ago.
The United States will not join the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure the restriction and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "rural sense" or "extreme irresponsibility" led to the announcement earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the major world powers at stake, tensions have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is mostly about saving economies rather than saving the planet, between China and the United States over their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world's most powerful countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take more drastic action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large emitters from acting responsibly.
It's clearly a game about a new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for International Nature Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding Copenhagen agreement, but the majority of the key participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the small island nations' push "has given a political boost to the whole polyarctic process" in part because they are now united and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The negotiations aroused new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before the heads of government fight over an agreement.
High-ranking officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, got off the planes and walked through the Bell Center behind closed doors for meetings and new conferences so they could outline their demands for next week's review.
The sheer scale of the rally -- with 13,000 people commuting to and from the convention center every day, activists playing guitars staging ironic scenes at night about the countries they thought had sent them, and hand-to-hand proposals being passed on paper rather than e-mail -- was dominated by the challenge.
The intensity is only a build-up: Copenhagen was attended by almost all the key ministers and, earlier, by 60 heads of state.
We've gotten into the high-end, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the deputy minister for global policy at the International Conservation.
We're getting heavy weights.
Britain 's first 140-mile-an-hour train defined this Monday 's feeling
At 5:13 Monday morning, the whistle blew through the sign of the train's departure, which marked the revolution in British transport.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles an hour, and will run from Ashford in Kent to St Pancras in London, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large agglomerations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
Neglected standing water should reduce travel times on passenger and business routes, and the shift from airplanes and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
In theory, the three major political parties were all in favor of this vision.
But the tens of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable project clashes and concerns about environmental damage have now held back the construction of Britain's high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned phase of the high-speed network.
New routing connecting London to the West Midlands has been proposed within five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods where environmental impact could be problematic.
In the open countryside, a 25-meter finish line was planned.
HS2 also envisages three options for the extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration where one high-speed line should lead to the West Midlands.
The line should split near Birmingham with one branch running from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most efficient choice has been made", said a railroad expert.
Once completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open until 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour at present.
The proposals should allow trains to run at 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK's network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already being designed to carry 400m long trains capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Up to 18 sets could be operated every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the measure with the internal market.
In view of the capital constraints, it is envisaged that the existing station would be extended to cover the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts say only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement the scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made before the general election.
Even if it does set the wheels in motion, the network should be built in pieces.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines but on existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain travel times between London and Scotland of over three hours.
This is seen as the crucial junction point for ensuring the transition from airplanes to trains, the landmark for the railway revolution.
The taxpayers have paid a £75,000 mortgage on the Tory greenhouse.
Alan Duncan, the Tory leader of the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by taxpayers last year for an orphanage he built in his constituency house.
The prison party spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living off "rations", has raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-lined extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds a month to the taxpayers.
The city authorities approved the claims in time and he was not interviewed by Sir Thomasen Legge, who was conducting a review of the membership expenditure.
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, owns two two-storey country houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
There's a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the Treasury Department agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is designated as an "orangehouse" in the plans.
The neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan converted the pupil insurance into a mortgage of £27,1406 from his London estate on a house in his constituency which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming approximately £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over £1,800 a month.
The interest on Mr Duncan's mortgage payment by RBS could not have changed at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The RBS standard variable mortgage payment fell from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March 2007 and remained at that level.
The last municipal documents show that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May of this year.
Mr. Duncan quit his job as the House's shadow leader in September after a secret newsman filmed him saying that members had to survive "on a ration" after a spending scandal.
"It's basically nationalized, you have to live on a budget and you're treated like shit".
He said, "I spent money on my garden and my claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I'm not going to".
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first called upon to explain his spending in May when it emerged he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before the Treasury approved it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had been claiming £4,000 for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for capital raises, which was approved by both the Treasury and then Legge".
He added: "It's not a matter of hiding and clicking or breaking the rules or anything.
It's absolutely straight down, by the rules, justified, and that's it.
It could not be in many other ways purer or simpler".
Come and take a close look at the cabin on Brighton Beach with the Advent calendar.
Brighton's seaside cottages have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual enjoyment through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December, using the Christmas buns as the theme of the decoration.
The event began on December 1st, allowing visitors to see the last hut from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. each day, and the bishop's bread and boiled wine provided free of charge.
Selected collages included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, with the cottage featuring the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, assistant TV marketing officer from Hove, is a non-scholarship priest in the Diocese of Chichester and head of the Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar in the huts came about as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we've tried to try and present it in a spiritual way".
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, to be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, and demonstrated around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday that could come into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, said that the growing global mobilization, as evidenced by the current demonstrations, has contributed to the "political burden" of a failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to AFP, incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the march, when a group of about 300 protesters dressed in black began smashing windows with tile and hammers.
The police immediately intervened.
In total, police announced the arrests of between 600 and 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separatist groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) Coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about 100 were handcuffed and in jail "held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where the talks were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was set up for the speakers, and a candlelit spiritual meeting was held in front of it, attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including a few Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, held their first meeting in Copenhagen in the early morning hours, at the urging of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "fair climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt to the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it's time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, and we can walk in them today, and we never could before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "Currently there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which contains many islands that are particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers estimate that some 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding strong action on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organised by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its own president, Georgia condemns as "a farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi declares the move a "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to Abkhaz election commission officials, turnout was 58 percent a few hours before polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results are due to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen under Russian domination", said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the 216,000-populated territory, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the 1992-93 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, Kvarčija Světlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapše, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling booth at the school in the capital city of Suchumi, a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the main theme of the presidential election in this region on the Black Sea coast, which boasts beautiful natural scenery.
Throughout this tiny country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with the Bagash next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin are placed.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials who had come to oversee the successful conduct of the elections were warmly welcomed by district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkhazians are grateful", he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and especially its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, toasting a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements signed last year with Moscow, such as the agreement that allows Russia to control the railway network of Abkhazia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or the opposition.
To win the election, you need a majority of more than 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive match must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations around the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, to be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, and demonstrated around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which is hosting delegates from 193 countries until December 18 to negotiate the agreement that could take effect on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed towards the Bella Center, where the talks were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was set up for the speakers, and a candlelit spiritual meeting was held in front of it, attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, the incidents occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began breaking windows.
The police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several protesters to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of between 600 and 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separatist groups that had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured by a tile in the jaw and four cars were set on fire near the squat near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters once again took to the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from the big German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, held their first rally in Copenhagen in the early morning hours at the urging of Friends of the Earth, a group that wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand the settlement of the environmental debt to the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it's time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, and we can walk in them today, and we never could before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures in the fight for another world, said he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate and social justice". "Currently there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam invited several well-known figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN High Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, which contains many islands that are particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
In Australia, organizers estimate that some 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated outside the city hall of the Philippines' capital, wearing red and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also met to demand strong action on climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organised by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general secondary school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that history and geography would be "strengthened" as part of the reform of the general secondary schools, although their teaching would no longer be compulsory in the final year of the science-focused secondary school.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and the same general culture program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "the hypocrisy must be stopped", because he believes that the S-specialty is no longer focused on the exact sciences" but "is essentially the best students in it".
The ES and L specialisations cannot be sub-specialisations for S, he continues, stressing: "I haven't heard many historians and intellectuals complain that geography and history aren't taught in the final year of vocational secondary school".
A poll by Ifop, published Saturday by Humanité, showed that seven out of ten (69%) French people disagree with the government's plan to abolish compulsory history and geography in the S-degree year of high school, and that's why many intellectuals and teachers, both on the left and some on the right, have criticized the cancellation.
The minister added that it was "not in the cards" to abolish philosophy in the graduate program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in the Tuesday mobilization against this project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers of secondary schools.
Under the Master's programme 2 (M2), they will undergo an admission test focusing on their field at the beginning of the year and a further test at the end of the year verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will participate in professional traineeships during the second year of the Master's programme and will act as trainee professors in the first year.
If you add up all the internships you'll be offered before the admissions process, you'll get more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince the world about climate change.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call made by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure in Ulm, at the morning session.
As one AFP reporter reported, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar of 15-minute expert presentations that will be recorded and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the seminar, which was named after a fish from a local lake that the students had named.
He said that the selection of some 20 contributors from different scientific disciplines was based on their charisma.
On climate warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes", said Jean Jouzel, speaking to an audience of 50 without any prepared notes, using only graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized, hoping that the audience will know that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific foundation".
The videos from these lectures will be posted on the school website starting December 15.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February, with more to follow every two months.
Late payments: anger at prison guards, planned action
Prison guards' unions announced a "general mobilisation" on Friday, demanding that bonuses and overtime payments, which were postponed for financial reasons to January, be paid by Christmas.
Prison FO (2nd Guards Union) asked non-duty staff to attend a demonstration outside the prison facilities on Tuesday morning and "block" them to alert them to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Officers (the third union in the sector) called on them to "convene meetings in individual prisons and start a fundamental mobilization", saying it was "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and overtime for night, Sunday and holiday work" worked in October would not be paid in December.
The first union of prison guards, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to express dissatisfaction and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime hours increased significantly in 2009 and that not all of them were included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari sent a communication to the prison guards' unions, assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts that prison staff are making to keep our prison system functioning and modernizing, the minister said in a statement.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of overtime is never repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mariová added.
The December wage will therefore be low, with the exception of executives, who receive prestigious bonuses for performing their duties and achieving their objectives, says Ufap/Unsa, and for whom "there is always room in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional union FO in Marseille has been outraged and announced its decision to boycott until the revocation of "all meetings and summonses".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless their October overtime is paid in December, as will overtime, which is also threatened by the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne FO.
At a time when we are given more and more work and tasks without additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest level of staff to pay for it, say the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are scarce, said Jean-François Forget, secretary-general of Ufap.
Obama claims he gives "better gifts" at Christmas than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "goddess" of the screen Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than I get".
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke on a special episode of ABC's Sunday night show about how they plan to spend Christmas and the end of the year in their new, prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged member of the family, gets his share.
Jesus loves Bo, too, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would "of course" get a gift, as evidenced by the preview footage.
And Michelle Obama also defended her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she gets: "No way, I gave you the best gifts last year", she teased the president.
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree, but then he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace, and he said, "Who gave you this?"
In this very relaxed one-hour show with the celebrity presenter who was a tireless supporter of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their more unpopular gifts as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-degree-transmission bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met, gave him for Christmas.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and giving me that basketball, the president told me.
It wasn't until much later that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady reminded me of the dollhouse again.
I had no idea how to organize everything in the house, so I just lined up all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday re-oped, RTL reports he's in a sleeping coma
Johnny Hallyday has been re-operated in Los Angeles for "injuries" from a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his next of kin, while RTL said the singer is in a state of artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent surgery again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injuries resulting from surgery" on his scalp he had done in Paris on November 26, his Paris press office said, saying the injuries required "a proper surgery".
However, the singer's press department tried to reassure the public, saying that the situation was "under control" and announcing that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the main partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little bit more certainty.
The press department, at the request of AFP, has not confirmed or commented on this information.
RTL also states that according to 'some sources' no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for a pre-existing pleurisy.
The operation, which had been planned days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
The doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection he contracted after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad time", but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he is a "big fighter".
He called me just before he was going to Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like that is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "responsively responds to antibiotics" and that the infection has been "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he noticed no particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had undergone surgery for a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every single one of his health issues has been heavily watched and commented on, and fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has trouble moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro 2009: Premier Bousquet in his favourite sport
Frédérick Bousquet, a Frenchman, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the large swimming pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in the small swimming pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, the last time that overalls are allowed, only three world records were broken, although many more were expected.
One of them was overcome by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztova in the 200 m position race and the remaining two by the Russian men's relay team in the 4x50 m position race.
It was a great loss for Bousquet, who had been trying to break the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he already holds in a large swimming pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, which was the first time ten swimmers had started instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganj (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as he had anticipated.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was within my reach, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore suits made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The suits have helped set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the jumpsuit did not help Paul Biedermann, a German who was twice world champion in the large swimming pool in Rome that summer, and who held the world record for reaching the hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds for the 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't give everything to this race.
I knew I wouldn't break the world record this time, but I did manage to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious competitor in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Roman sarcophagus plate belonging to Zola has been auctioned off for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus belonging to none other than French writer Emil Zola was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, far more than had been estimated, said an art dealer at Sotheby's.
The price of this two-meter-long, 63-centimeter-high headboard, dating from the third century C.E., was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysus scenes in elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satire and baccantes is a rare work, with very few similar pieces in the world, perhaps four or five", Florent Heintz, vice-president of the Sotheby's auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art, told AFP on Tuesday.
The piece was sold along with hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it's the item that has probably been the most requested, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
That Emile Zola purchased this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The tablet was kept in the famous Borgia collection in Rome for almost 300 years, and then gradually appeared in the bathtub of French actress Cecile Sorel in her private hotel in Paris, and in the bathtub of Paul Reynaud, minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
It's been there for 50 years.
Florent Heintz found, in a search of the Louvre museum's database, that this tablet was part of the "remnants of Émile Zola" opened since 1903, the year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" frescoes.
An aborted attempt to get President Zelaya out of Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that conditions were not met for the transfer of deposed Honduran president Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe passage by the rebels.
After a phone call I had with President Zelaya last night, it seems that there is no way to make this move, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has been diverted back, a source at the Directorate General for Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad, only to give him the possibility of safe passage.
But the deposed president refused these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as a head of state in exile.
The coup government "failed again when they wanted me to resign . . . they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
"I can stay here for 10 years, I have my guitar here", added the deposed president, who had been hiding in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee of safe passage, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, to Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
News of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military has increased security.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the putschist government's position.
They show their marginal attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who had become close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested and held responsible for the crime of "Great Treason" for which he is accused, the coup government claims.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to organize presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In a controversial election, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power, until his term expired on January 27.
Wall Street rises, the U.S. trade balance is encouraged to be optimistic
The New York Stock Exchange closed on a strong note on Thursday, and the U.S. trade balance showed a rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68,78 points to 10,405,83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190,06 points, according to the final closing figures.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0,58% (6,40 points) to 1102,35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focusing primarily on the US balance sheet figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to increase.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the United States' major trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States, unemployment rose against all expectations last week, with the number of job applicants reaching 474,000.
But the average number of new job applicants has fallen over the past four weeks "to the lowest of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
The 10-year government withdrawal rose to 3,482% from 3,423% on Tuesday evening, and the 30-year yield rose to 4,492% from 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: hundreds of regime supporters chanted "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime on Thursday booed the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, preventing another demonstration that has seen dozens of dissidents arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were shouted out in the streets by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they marched towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Away with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's supporters chanted with their fists up to the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came to "ensure security".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the day before, but no injuries or arrests had been reported.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, about 10 dissidents were detained by plainclothes police, who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police loaded the dissidents, who were being chased by pro-regime supporters, into civilian vehicles by force.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize winners, the "Ladies in White", organised an unauthorised march for the "release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the rebels to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their arch-enemy, the United States.
Miraculously, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by supporters of the government against "opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, with its Communist Party at the head and a one-party government, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman stabbed an 80-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A maniac armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary investigations, the assailant, aged 28, allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in or outside the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, according to police and witnesses.
A badly wounded old man, born in 1929, died in hospital from his injuries, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In or near this pharmacy, an assailant attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, in his early 30's, started to fight back and was wounded.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second wounded is in danger, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock", a police source said.
The gunman, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on the Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He wounded two other people, apparently by accident: a man in his 30s and a man in his 40s, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried with a cross on his back, said the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several bystanders, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimonies gathered by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They didn't succeed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed to him, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man and were wounded by fists, a police source said.
The incident took place on one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The passers-by came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went outside and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him to safety and noticed large wounds on his abdomen, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, another person in his 30's came in, also stabbed.
A man who didn't have any identification with him was later arrested by state police.
The Nanterre prosecutor referred the case to the investigation department of the Hauts-de-Seine police (SDPJ 92).
Suspect was taken to hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source didn't rule out his placement in a psychiatric facility.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "out of his mind" like "all the lunatics of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the criminal prosecution to end
The lawyer for Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski again asked Thursday in Los Angeles, California, to stop prosecuting his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence over a moral scandal that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", criticized before three judges of the California Second Circuit Court of Appeals the serious errors that occurred in the trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, said counsel Hummel, adding that the judge who was ruling the case at the time, Laurence Rittenbanda, "had a chill in his back".
According to him, the judge (who has since died) was supposed to have spoken to the prosecutor before handing down the sentence, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison  which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", by the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared in late September that he had "spoiled" the author of the document.
If the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will request a hearing in which he can present evidence of his claims.
The applicant reiterated what had already been said in the first State appeal, namely that no serious examination of the application for a stay of prosecution would take place until Roman Polanski was brought to trial.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court had ruled on the "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot on U.S. soil since.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
"We want to tell Roman Polaski and the other defendants that it is possible to escape", Ms. Asayam asks.
He believes the director "is asking the court for a favor and contempt for its authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Attorney Hummel wasn't the only one who asked for the suspension of Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also reiterated her request to terminate the criminal proceedings.
She reminded her client that she could no longer endure the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case comes up, adding: "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the orders of the United States.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he awaits possible deportation.
Wall Street ends up with no direction, held back by the rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended with no direction on Friday, the market mixed between better-than-expected indicators in the US and the rising price of the dollar: Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, dropped from 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased from 0,37% (4,06 points) to 1,106,41 points.
Frankly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It's still in a tight range, and the volume of trade has fallen sharply, and I think it's going to stay that way until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of better than expected economic indicators which "helped to improve the market sentiment on the stability of the economic recovery", summarised analyst Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month, and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary index estimate from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence has also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes have been held back by a new rise in the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in two months, "pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Tech stocks are losing ground.
The stock market is down.
The 10-year yield of the Treasury rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday evening and the 30-year yield rose to 4,497% from 4,492% the day before.
Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, the 112 Miss World contestants are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This is the second year that the big beauty pageant has been held in the suburbs of Johannesburg, and so far five contestants have made it to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African residency.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen so much and I've had so much experience! confided Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, now in its ninth year in South Africa, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. local time.
I couldn't have imagined a more beautiful country to wear my crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to have been able to experience it twice, confided Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second visit to South Africa was a time of many meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking landscape".
After months of performances, auditions, press conferences and safari, Miss is now focused on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also contested the election of Aishwarya Rai, winner in 1994, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about looks.
"We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown", says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th annual event will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, swimsuits.
The show will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
As in the previous year, the candidates took part in safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on a bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
A special event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most memorable event will be the draw for the World Cup in Cape Town, in the southwest of the country, in June 2010, which helped the country to boost the event.
I could meet people I never dreamed I'd meet.
I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", his son David assured us upon his arrival at the Los Angeles airport on Friday, where he flew in to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
"He's very strong and everything is going very well", said David Hallyday, as he disembarked from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.
The singer's son, who appeared to be calm, said he would be arriving "as soon as possible" at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a post-operative infection from an incision of his intervertebral disc in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singing night in Los Angeles was "put into artificial sleep" for comfort purposes, to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in a coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was hospitalized for an infection following an operation on his spinal cord on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious injuries caused by this stroke, the singer had to undergo surgery again on Wednesday night to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at the French high school in Los Angeles, which their daughter Jade attends, on Friday morning.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he will be flying to Los Angeles on Monday to see the singer.
The producer has strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles declared themselves outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor by telephone and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which was quite surprising to me, since I had myself suffered from intervertebral palsy twice before, he added.
He said on RTL radio that the singer had probably left after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything".
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working at at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma from a brain haemorrhage.
He's also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times for medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Medical chamber lawyer Olivier Metzner described him as "a man of no scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber and who cannot be "remotely recommended".
After days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He reported that the procedure had "proceeded quite well" and that the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary", he added.
The singer's health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains in question.
It is clear that the date for the renewal of the planned tour on 8 January seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising its voice and calling on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to take over the acronym of the former Giscard party, saying that he must not use the acronym in any media under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to adopt the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear its legacy after he has given his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, was scheduled to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This move was supported by Hervé de Charetta (formerly a member of the UMP and now a member of the NC), who attributes ownership of the UDF brand to himself, having first registered it at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association committee, led by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, broke their silence and formally requested the minister and the MPs to stop using the abbreviation and to return ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have made alarming statements about proposing that your political movement 're-adopts' the acronym 'UDF', writes the Association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoD and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centriste.
You also considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the website of your movement the name 'New Centre' with the slogan 'UDF Today's Day', the signatories of the letter also note.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF committee, which asks the NC to "immediately remove all references to the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) website".
It also requests Hervé de Charette 'to transfer the ownership of the trade mark to its legitimate owners'.
If you do not, we will go to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "choose to leave" in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002 to found the UMP.
The New Centre therefore has no right, according to them, to use the abbreviation UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to create a committee to defend the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, 'when he registered the trade mark, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used nonexistent acronym registrations to do so on his own account.
This negligence begins to turn into a crime, they claim, and then they ironically say to NC strategy: "We think it's more valuable to make a name for ourselves in politics and in everyday life than to emerge from anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name to which we have no right".
The Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for the abuse of a state of weakness.
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and rule on whether he used the infirmity of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him for.
The photographer, 62, known for his celebrity photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of a disability, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision confirms that a trial is indeed underway in what can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight for control of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, to be carried out by a panel of three doctors.
The heiress and major shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors elected on Friday are expected to report by 10 March 2010 and to comment on whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what time.
I think he's going to take it.
I will talk to her about it, said Georges Kiejman, Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, after the hearing.
As regards the lawyer for François Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the decision of the Court.
The expert will show that he manipulated this old lady who needs protection, confirmed.
Two years ago, the only daughter of Liliana Bettencourt filed a criminal case against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in cheques, life insurance contracts and paintings of masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other hand, has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was considering the merits of the lawsuit brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday courtroom speech of the lawyers sometimes turned into a family truth hour.
The lawyer for Lilian Bettencourt has presented three letters sent by her client to her notary public (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) expressing her distrust of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to her lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has again found the complainant's actions unlawful, all the more so since the custody judge has refused her application to initiate legal protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is "fully competent to appear in court, not under guardianship or custody.
No one else will act for her", prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney confirmed.
The Court finally decided that the question of the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers should be raised at the opening of the proceedings.
The management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, the management of large companies has been behaving in a way reminiscent of the way firms treated consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees identify with "values" determined from above, as was the case in the past, when the products that came from the ideas of the chief factory technicians had to be forced on the consumer.
By making the customer the centre of business, the marketing revolution has set the strategy of market conquest in the right direction... even as authoritarian attempts to impose products different from the customer's preferences regularly return!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much wider phenomenon affecting mainly the management.
This demobilization is adversely affecting the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires an active approach and foresight from all parties involved" and requires employees to make commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That's why we're calling for a management revolution that aims to put employees at the center of the enterprise as much as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls - such as the questionnaire presented to Orange employees - contribute to a revolution in management practices?
I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I've already seen for myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure after different turns returns preferably to what it always did!
And because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one's own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they're graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of intellectual convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now revived by the US neuroscientists and widely disseminated without much knowledge by the scientific establishment and the media.
With the "levers" (sic) of managers' involvement, a recent Ipsos survey on Figaro.fr showed that it only confirms managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive vision of human behavior.
It is about integrating the basic observation into all management intentions and practices: Employees will only be able to commit to the company if they see it as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies on motivational functional analysis are concerned with this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their enterprises on the basis of pre-defined dossiers which allow them to evaluate, through the image that the enterprise has, what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their HR management 'on the right track'.
This creates fertile ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
In his Oslo speech, "a just war", Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who first scoffed at Obama's award on October 9th, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a right-wing Republican muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself had spoken out on the subject of the "once-necessary" war in her memoir, which is just coming out.
War is the last thing Americans want to do, of course, but it's necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he thinks.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the troop deployment in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House, who appreciated the president's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I consider this speech to be quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former lawmaker, who some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the peace prize if there was no use of force".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech".
Not only did he introduce himself as a "citizen of the world" as he always does, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and that they are not doing too much to preserve it", Gerson said.
Among the few disgruntled on the right is Bush-era hawks, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "monotonous, puffed up and uninspired", as reported on the website National Review Online.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
"When we wrap war in the wrapper of justice, we can easily justify the slaughter of innocent people", he warned.
However, the center-left press has taken a favorable view of the president.
While the Los Angeles Times continues to consider the award of the Peace Prize to Obama premature, it has called his performance "an over-achievement" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide for international decision-making in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression", says the Californian newspaper.
Obama "made the speech that was needed", the New York Times said, calling it "simple and instructive".
Road hauliers, three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of Christmas.
After three marathons of negotiations, the road haulage unions and the TLF, the only employers' organisation to stay until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning, hoping to have the text of the agreement signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of a meeting that started at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the agreement to be signed at 6 p.m.
This conflict "would be very damaging to businesses" and "would risk disrupting the holidays at the end of the year", Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wage earners (local and regional road transport) and a 2,9% increase for the highest wage earners (international transport).
The hourly wage for minimum wages is increased from EUR 8,72 to EUR 9,06.
It's not much, but it's a lot of effort, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight we're going to order our members to make sure there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied", he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the 'right deal', even though it was difficult to admit the high wage increases in the face of international competition'.
According to him, the lowest wage will be increased by EUR 170 per month and the highest by EUR 100 to 120.
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of workers' rights and freedoms was adopted by the Council on 22 June.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The agreement also provides for a 3% revaluation of travel expenditure and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow the focus on the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "€100 million cut in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "unilateral" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to be applied first to the enterprises that are members of this organisation, and later to the whole industry, in the event of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will happen "in the shortest possible time", assured Bussereau.
The only thing that can stop the whole process is the disapproval of the employers' organizations.
The FNTR calls it a 'bad trade' as €100 million has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to hold an emergency meeting not because of a mutual analysis but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eating public during the approaching Christmas holidays, complained Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement risks "burying a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector" over the next 12 months.
RER A: weekend break, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The interruption of the RER A commuter train line, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend as the Friday negotiations between the unions and RATP management on the second day of the strike have not led to any concrete results on the question of the premium claim.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of the important Christmas shopping weekend, trains will run only between 10 and 8 p.m. on the main section (between La Défence and Nation), with one train out of every four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which await more than 200 000 customers each day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has been trying to secure connections with large shops".
The RER A runs from west to east of the Paris metropolitan area.
The section managed by RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in peak service, and virtually no train was running during off-peak hours as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of Ile de France settled in different ways and there was no chaos on the platforms.
So early in the morning, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, partly because pupils and students were missing.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29, from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he got there on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, as more police and security guards were expected.
The RER and SNCF commuter trains to and from Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or departed from Saint-Lazare stations with a metro connection.
The next general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, during which the results of the meeting with the management on Friday afternoon, which the unions rated as "weak", will be evaluated.
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A commuter trains in all aspects, working time adjustment, career path, etc.
But this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved prize, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP even suspended the premium proposals for the time being, which angered the CGT, saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while the passenger transport companies and SNCF were able to do so".
At a new meeting scheduled for Monday, the transport companies will "examine the conditions of the profession more closely", RATP said.
Which was why the union thought the company was "making fun of weekend commuters".
In the early hours of the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the works committee at his Paris headquarters.
The management, which has so far refused to discuss any issues during the strike, has therefore decided to hold a meeting in the interest of "calming down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents announce a strike alert.
The unions are demanding a premium of between EUR 120 (Unsa) and EUR 150, of which EUR 30 is variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants) and are complaining about the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries one million passengers a day.
RER suburban train drivers earn between EUR 2200 and 2700 gross wages and between EUR 600 and 650 bonuses for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays at an advanced stage of their career.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that prompted protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the task of the government, which is trying to extend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "a nest for activities that threaten the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of talks.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysela Tugluk, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats (out of 500) in the Parliament.
The party leadership had already warned before the verdict that MEPs would rather leave Parliament than act as non-political MPs.
The decision follows a trial launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accused the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legitimate political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic links" with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government is extending a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offering a series of measures to strengthen their rights and try to limit Kurdish support for the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the party's dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations have erupted in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being detained and clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the verdict, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear gas and water cannons, and protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired rocks from handcuffs.
Around 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict was handed down, Mr. Türk said that the justice decision would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he told the press.
The government, which is made up of the party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We're against interfering with parties.
It's not solving anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
A nice, crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully the citizens, says the head of the FES winter technical services department.
But so that his employees could try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists say it could be the first time.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are on standby to deal with the snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
Once the snow falls in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called A-slices, explains Brauburger.
These include the main and through roads such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire roads, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and descending sections like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, a moist salt spray, which is more durable, is sprayed for up to three hours, about 1,000 miles (1,040 km).
That's why FES starts at 3:00 a.m. "so the roads are clear when the traffic starts to go to work".
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of winter technical services, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers".
Only when the snow is not so heavy is it time to take the routes of the underground and interconnecting roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
Last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll complain.
At 5:00 a.m., the FES will begin its march, with priority on clearing dangerous areas and crossings.
The FES is not usually able to take care of all the cycle paths.
In Frankfurt, a special service is on duty from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. to monitor bridges, says Brauburger.
Because of the rapid ice formation, the waterfalls are prone to freeze as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will call them if necessary.
The crib of the dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The seven-foot-long, six-foot-tall animal ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-like claws, and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday's issue of the journal Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to display these physical features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Tawa opens a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the kinship, distribution, and traits of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we find a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unheard of for Triassic fossils, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The find confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an unusual discovery: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only found in fragments".
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
The discovery is not particularly sensational, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, however, so the attribution of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, experts debate when lizards split into the three most important evolutionary lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also the birds, the "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivores Ornithischia (bird-eaters), which included Triceratops and Stegosaurus, for example.
Tawa Hallae is the original therapist, according to Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced characteristics, Nesbitt says.
For example, on the skull of the Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs that descendants of theropod birds also have.
Thanks to air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
The Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Since the giant sauropod's related lineage later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists inferred that lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, three developmental lines soon split and spread from South America to all the continents that then formed a single land mass, like the supercontinent Pangaea.
And it would also be supported by the fact that the team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods along with Tawa Hallae.
The three cannot come from a common immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, one of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture may give a distorted picture, since there are many primitive dinosaur fossils left in South America, and they are rarely found on other continents.
How dinosaurs could prove that they evolved from a relatively rare sub-line of reptiles to the dominant vertebrates on Earth in the Middle Ages remains a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, including the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved, while relatives went extinct and the Triassic and Jurassic intersected.
The story of success didn't last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, which the dinosaurs just happened to survive, but the reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could outrun the competition.
The story of success didn't last forever, anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved in the Triassic and have lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
They were joined by lecturers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police's evacuation of the occupied Goethe University casino in Frankfurt caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police intervention instigated by the presidency.
Because of the painted walls and artwork, the university president, Werner Müller-Estler, had the building evacuated, which was occupied last week by striking students and lecturers.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories argue, does not justify "the violent dismantling of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command".
The exclusion constitutes an 'unacceptable interference' with the freedom of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegitimize and criminalize protest" and diverts attention from content.
The Bureau has avoided a necessary discussion.
The speakers are calling for a halt to the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support the damage done to property.
Legitimate protest
The youth union Verdi and the German Trade Union Association also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's mysterious Earth Youth Alexander Klein.
The Hessian Minister of Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), is defending the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the president of the university.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Temporary Hour) in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We have an understanding of protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of addressing the students' arguments and demands, there was a purge.
Linke has submitted a proposal calling on the Home Secretary to report on the police deployment.
The new Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a heavily guarded site where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district of 216,000 people, 23 miles [37 km] from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russia's Silicon Valley".
Major micro- and nanoelectronics research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of the city of Zelenograd have been in contact with the Frankfurt Riedberg Science Centre - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The EU and the EU have signed a 'Protocol on Close Cooperation' in Frankfurt on Wednesday.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Roslyak and the Prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, and signed by the head of planning for Frankfurt, Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises involved in scientific research will attend a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be able to enter the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific firms want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to major Russian research institutions and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large conglomerates Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are located.
The brake shall be in the same position as the brake.
Dimension Stuttgart 21 is not ready at all.
For the project's supporters, it is simply the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the '80s.
The main stations with tracks ending in the city centre were then considered to be 19th-century transport-technical fossils that act as brakes on modern rail transport, as it took enormously long to tow the locomotives from behind forward.
Run, stop, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the main stations are gone: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station which lies roughly halfway along the route of the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan 'the heart of Europe'.
It really starts with S21, although the visions of the '80s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hesse and Bavarian metropolis, the start of construction is almost unfinanceable.
Since modern shuttle trains with motorized and driverless vehicles at both ends have been available, the main station has no more problems getting in and out.
Still, it starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulm.
It was pushed by state and local politicians.
The routes are cooperating, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state-owned group.
Urbanism is still a way to justify the project.
There will be a new urban space that, if we believe the computer imagery of the designers, will contain lots of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The passenger stations and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has been attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights back then.
Modern transport policy must, however, focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail is far greener than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep climb.
More seriously, S21 is indirectly affecting a lot of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts say it's between 10 and 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade, there will be a lack of funding for further nodes and narrow spots in the network.
The Department of Transportation has 60 major projects on the list.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at a slower pace.
This is where you need to push hard.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley line will become the bottleneck of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport ruling.
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will oppose the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that the State would have to re-adjust the night ban in the event of the planned construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The permitting of 17 flights between 11pm and 5am, as the provincial government assumes, is not in accordance with the law mandated to protect the public from nighttime air traffic noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4th whether to seek a review of the verdict.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged the government representative to refrain from reviewing the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the pledges they made before the election on the night flight ban, which could be seen as a "breach of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green Party leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's campaign slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's rebuke, the state government is trying to get to its night flights through "a twist of law and a trick".
A thorough legal review takes time.
The Coalition doesn't want to work on a quick first impression.
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements on the night flight ban have never been as strong as those of the opposition.
American banks are paying back the aid
The crisis-shaken American big banks are breaking free from their bonds with the state.
Bank of America paid back the total of $ 45 billion (about 30 billion euros) in aid from the bank 's Tarp rescue fund on Wednesday .
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that come with accepting money - limiting the payout of bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has raised well over $19 billion in net money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the money was taken from her own treasury, which was filled up by union sales, among other things.
Bank President Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night for the cash injection that helped us get through the tough times.
The money institution took a hit at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the State by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC reported, citing sources, that the US bank could announce a capital increase of about $20 billion as early as Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, the aid was already paid by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick selection
It was just faster than expected.
The station announced its successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nicolas Brender.
Last night, the board wanted to settle on that person.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in the capital city of Berlin.
The station didn't confirm it, officially, to avoid speeding up the process.
However, it may also have been that they did not want to harm ZDF's trustee Markus Schächter if the proposal did not pass the board.
Frey, Schächter's nominee, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the closing of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
The vote for Brender was seven against seven, and Schächter's loss of the seat was a bitter, though predictable, defeat.
The EU's majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to continue in the office of the highly respected editor, arguing that the quotas for watching the ZDF news broadcast had decreased under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence of the ZDF was sharply criticized.
In the last debate, 35 lawyers from the state courts have intervened, judging Koch's action as unconstitutional.
It was useless.
On the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4th, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey joined the ZDF, first at the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal adviser to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was named Medium Magazine's Journalist of the Year on Wednesday, was ousted, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent in the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should amend the state contract with the ZDF so that the intendent's personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's intended successor, Peter Frey, had a clever chess move on the board - a move that was heavily criticized by the board immediately after Brender's ouster.
This evidence of journalistic independence enabled him to be nominated as editor-in-chief without losing face, and Schächter could be elected by the board without suspecting that the party was being pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already classed as a left-wing liberal.
The studio is getting rid of the junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the ministers of culture finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At the conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both parties agreed that they wanted to improve the conditions for bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: In principle, each study module should end with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed and a 'real and defendable level' should be guaranteed.
To do this, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for bachelor and master studies.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Less rehearsals
Since the start of the student protests in February, ministers of culture and university rectors have been talking about better education.
Now, for the first time, they're filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided to reduce the number of examinations drastically in part: "Each module will normally be completed with only one examination", says a 30-page report, which is partly intended to regulate the re-accreditation of the study fields.
"The significantly reduced test load", stated Accreditation Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm, is to "stop the faulty development that has significantly reduced the complexity of the study".
In addition, the 'difficulty of study' is to be the 'decisive criterion' in future implementation.
Modules and content 'must be rigorously reviewed' so as 'not to unnecessarily restrict students' choice of subjects to be taught.
the seminars".
Students should have 'the right to a space that allows and supports their own initiative'.
The rules should apply to the approval of new fields of study, after review, but also to existing fields of study.
These need to be re-accredited every five years  which means that it will take until 2015 for all the fields of study to be re-examined.
The ten accreditation agencies responsible for this are located throughout Germany and are subject to the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of culture urged the Länder to act so that the agencies were not overloaded with teaching materials and the examination regime was not strict.
In the individual Länder, universities and colleges have already agreed with the Land Ministries on the appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country to have pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should be used primarily by universities to cover consultancy programmes and study advisory services, and to strengthen examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities are willing to spend ten million euros on this.
The government wants to introduce an amendment to the university law in the parliament at the beginning of 2010.
According to it, only one single examination should be required to complete the study module.
The degree programme should be even more flexible, with recognition of examinations from other higher education institutions guaranteed and the access to the Master's degree facilitated.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
Along with praise, criticism was leveled at the resolution.
The Juso Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for education policy-making not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students should also "say a word about it" as affected persons.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Rectors of Higher Education (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelová: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK was consulting on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn Resolutions did not go far enough: They require a legal right that would allow every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to postgraduate master's studies.
Second, the Länder must ensure that the current generation of bachelor students will have enough places in the master's degree programmes tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, said Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW board.
The federal states must employ many more lecturers.
The Ministers of Culture did not, however, comment on the free access to master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Hertha Müller
Getting into Germany and out is nice, almost no control"... is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Solner, who in this tongue-in-cheek piece focuses on the experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, lectured in poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt in 1993, and since 2002 has been the head of the Hessian Forum for Literature at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A considerable extra-literary stir was caused last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently disoriented and confused, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, that he had been working as a secret informant for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Along with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts to recruit him began, they say, in a subtle way, as early as 1971.
I am, continued Söllner, "someone who has not resisted enough the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate".
The poet Werner Solner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Hertha Müller and her unprecedented literary tackling of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors originating from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depth and shame of a political system based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In the Securitate files, undercover agent Walter played a role, said Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, and referred to the positive influence undercover agent Walter had on him.
He "fucked" me on all the points that mattered to him, says Markel.
I have a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but the former dissident's confession and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Herta Müller wrote back in July, after reading her own 914-page file, that Germany was a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies.
The affected, one can imagine, will speculate and in some cases even know which name is behind the code name Sorin, Voic, and also Walter.
Unlike the domestic, however already very certain, review of the Stazi files, the manipulation of the legacy of Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been curtailed and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, the National Securitate File Processing Council (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, and file issuance has been rather protracted since then.
It is only since 2005 that there is a law governing the management of files.
That former Securitate members still have a great deal of influence in Romania was demonstrated by an interview after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which one of the former Securitate bosses from Temeșoara spoke negatively about the award winner.
She's supposed to be psychotic, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The desecration of power has been expressed quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as well as the unsolved crimes, raise inevitable questions.
The peculiar reaction of the audience to Solner's confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the attribution of guilt and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herty Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The Champions League is a saturated bet
It looked like a clean-cut salesman from a cute Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer was handing out sweets, when he boarded a recalled Mercedes C class at 15 minutes past midnight with the new VfBr trainer Christian Gross and his orange-colored sponsor bag.
A man with a prominent bald head let himself be driven to a strange city for him.
Otherwise he could drive alone - alcohol was not at stake, and a 55-year-old drunken man was fortunately not.
It's been a pleasant evening, but she'll be back at work tomorrow.
Or it's just getting started.
The words of the Swiss, who has only been involved for three days: "We have reached the semi-finals", in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be overwhelmed by success: it will be a brutal fight against relegation".
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It's important to repeat the king-class performance in Mohuchi on a regular league day.
And to avoid another obvious weakness after three quick goals by Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnok (11.).
Drawing
The Champions League semi-finals (match 16/17 + 23/24 February/re-match 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the sparkling arrival of Babbel's successor will thus be preserved.
Not just the supposed healer who gave unsure Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to commit and joy in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encourage them to be more courageous, explained soul healer Gross so simple-sounding successful recipe, but with Babbel's therapy, it has not shown any efficacy.
He breathed a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after several weeks of injury-induced absence became the best player on the field because of his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" he found with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working methods of the new manager: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in this situation".
Babella obviously missed it.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers don't want to overestimate the victory against the weakened reserve and completely overburdened defense of the Romanian host.
They would have won Glasgow before the ugly wake-up call of a 4-0 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that while one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not over the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to the weekend events that were brought to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that act other than Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He presented the board with a weak lead and decided to change coach after pressure from pubescent fans.
Even the fact that his day off after the game was cancelled, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmann's remarks "formulated pure selfishness", Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeeper.
Both 40s are probably not going to have any more joy in life.
Anyway, they're all in agreement that without the hard work of the coaching staff, this game-changing, fighting performance wouldn't have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
The heavyweight championship fight
The passionate duel in Bern: challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked by words and gestures the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after 12 tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the WBC heavyweight division.
The jury was unanimous.
Vitaly Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson by unanimous points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
It is Klička's third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice world champion in the WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it didn't turn out the way everyone expected.
Klickko improved his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice being defeated by injury.
Challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th battle.
In front of 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, the 2.02 meter tall Klickko was leading the fight with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters shorter Johnson, who had announced the end of the Clitch era before the duel, was however, retreating from the strokes of the world champion, so Clitch could not strike the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, the passive Johnson did very little on the challenger and was just trying to get to the next round.
Klizka provoked by his words and gestures, but his blows only hit the world champion rarely.
But he's only the second boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klitschko for a full 12 rounds.
The challenger had caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschka as a "disgusting zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion allowed himself to be provoked, pulling Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klick returned
Klickko remained undefeated in his fourth fight since his return on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and reclaimed his WBC belt, which he had previously surrendered without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomera of Cuba in the title defence and in September, Chris Arreola of the United States.
I've only got one shot in this fight and I'm in good physical shape, justifying a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four of the family's important titles.
Brother Vladimir is the World Champion of the WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt is worn by Briton David Haye, after he toppled the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolaj Vulayev in November.
Haye called off a match against Clitter in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promoter company is reportedly planning a match against Klick at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Case of the Kunduz
Front attack from the opposition: Green party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of the misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - The latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike suggest that the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed deliberate deception.
The minister said "consciously untrue" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, said the head of the Green party Jürgen Trittin on Saturday's ARD news programme "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: lying.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the gist of the report that NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not just about destroying the hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The US airstrike, requested by German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately to the Bundestag and clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, urged Jürgen Trittin and her Green colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm flatly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no say in the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the ministry's account of the background to the firing of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both of them correctly and completely informed Guttenberg about the background of the attack on the tankers.
It was officially reported that they were to deny the existence of NATO reports and withhold sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the surroundings, both top officials were reported to have even alerted the Defense Department to several reports, including a two-page document by Commander Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The Frankfurt Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert was to have requested clarification in a letter.
It's noted that he has not received any response yet.
The Ministry did not comment on the complaints on Saturday, and indicated that this will be addressed in the Federal Assembly's investigation committee, which will be established next Wednesday.
The worlds of dreams
Some people see images and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
It's not just the mentally ill or the drug-addicted who blur the lines between fantasy and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we are allowed to surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fantasies.
But in the Western world today, people who experience waking dream states, seeing and hearing things that others cannot see or hear, are generally considered to be insane or drug addicts, or at least freaks.
But such images and voices are not limited to the mentally ill or the drug-addicted.
It's our imagination that's to blame: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paint pictures, or write novels, will here and there blur the lines between dream, imagination, and reality.
Dreams of altered states of consciousness can take many forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, however, visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanistic states of delusion, psychosis, and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal transmitters in the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interactions between different parts of the brain are disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions are very common in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him.
The connection between delusion and sleep has been a concern of philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great similarity between delusion and dream states", and Sigmund Freud even described dreams as "psychosis, with all its nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and crisp in color.
Gravity has no power over it, it's hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He feels the kick.
Behind him, winged devil figures with blood-red grimaces, appreciating teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices are coming from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand the voices that insult and insult him anymore.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, loops them into a loop and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one of the speakers and puts a noose around his neck.
He jumps.
The wrench is on.
Learn, shout in chorus voices, tearing his drums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Henning T. is 40 today, has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were LSD-fueled.
He's been diagnosed with schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, taking medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced my worst fear and deepest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people will develop schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, making it the second most commonly treated disorder in psychiatric clinics after depression.
In acute schizophrenia, people often can't distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, and they get into a state of wakefulness that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, delusions of belonging, or delusions of being haunted.
Especially common is hearing voices - voices that command, comment, or conduct dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person is unable to distinguish between the important and the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the distracting signals, the mind is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream opens up psychosis has built up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, becoming, as in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is mostly impossible, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
To experience a hallucination for once in your life
Unlike in dreams, says Fuchss, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains essentially preserved".
The delusions and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience occurs within the real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why exactly our brains make these changes.
Exceptional circumstances can cause anyone to lose touch with reality in the short term, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into a psychotic state.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes aren't the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We suspect that early in development there is damage to neuronal maturation in the brain, such as viral disease in the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the neurological system is affected, which has not been seen for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the trigger for psychosis, if it is available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains boil
The crazy thing is that psychotronic sufferers suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medicines, others pay for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his findings in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are a typical symptom of psychosis, but they are also a surprisingly common symptom of many other disorders.
Besides mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, there are also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's, or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kastens, are made up of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain that process sensory perception are over-active or under-suppressed; when our brains are boiling or when we lack stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal from stimulation, stress, love worries, or other extraordinary conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of those interviewed reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomeranian Voivodeship, and attends the local high school.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the patterns and the voices.
At breaks, she may be approached by a long-haired, dark-haired cockroach.
When he answers, the classmates look at her in surprise - no one but she sees or hears the boy.
This shy girl is considered a dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows it.
She's awake, she hears and sees the boy, just like she hears and sees the girl sitting next to her in the bench.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a good feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows this boy and the other delusions aren't real, and he'll disappear again.
The nightly visions are rather depressing
Delusions are often a burden.
When she is sitting in class, she cannot watch the lesson many times, for in her eyes and ears the teacher is presenting the new classmate, while he explains the mathematical equation audibly and visually to all the others on the blackboard.
The night visions are rather depressing.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which rarely comes and is too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her hands and feet, are coming before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
In the fall of 2009, Sarah K. turns 20 today.
She graduated last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Hallucinations are also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or deprived of stimulation, he is more likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain is not busy enough and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when, at 13, she learned that the man she had called her father for as long as she could remember was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same areas of the brain that process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, and reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Kasten also considers night dreams to be a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world of too much focus on consciousness, unfortunately, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a hard, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity -- delusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has been studying what he calls the oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness into a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the subject perceives as real and cannot even distinguish them back from the waking state.
Oneiroid states of consciousness occur in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with loss of the world and himself, such as permanent, complete immobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Kind of a border state between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality, you can't handle a situation, you change the world, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transference in some unbearable situation that allows us humans our own ability to form, to pass into instant unconsciousness.
It's all real, even later in memory
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Heart Exchange) as a salvation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery and a heart transplant, his consciousness set off on a journey of several days, his body lying motionless in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he had created, visited foreign times and places: he became an old man chained to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst the nobility who make intoxicants out of blood.
He's on a motorcycle to his homeland, surfing in a hospital bed to a surf shop in the Alps, and he meets a Korean mobster.
He's completely immersed in the imaginary, everything is real, even later in his memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussene.
A dream is a different state, describing your experience.
Unlike dreams, memories of these mental journeys are still vivid years later in trivial details.
Even more vivid and intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other authentic experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of the external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
A reality that can also be enriching.

At 27 , the children are to take over the publishing business .
The new head of Kallen is a temporary solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company is to remain 100% family-owned.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for the long term.
Both children will inherit at 27 and have a firm will to enter the company, a 69-year-old man tells SPIEGEL.
We've been working on the details.
The question of whether they're also active in the company is only raised afterwards.
I wonder if they have the skills.
You can't put your kids in charge of 7,500 employees if they're not capable enough.
That would kill the kids and the business.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he was stepping down as chairman of the board in January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Management of Burda since 1999.
He was in charge of technology at first.
Later, with the Treasury, responsibility for the company's assets was added, and after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also Direct Marketing, Cizin, Press and Finance.
For the first time, no family members are running the publishing house.
The Burd's children are 19 and 17, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to "curse 10, 15 years", Burda said.
The holding company should remain 100% family-owned in the future, Burda says.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda expressed that even family businesses are not certain of extinction: "It has always been the case with companies that have been infected by the desire for capital, that have speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power", Burda claims.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don't want to play World League with "Time", these deals are too big.
Complex beauty care
Everything you could ever want in terms of beauty and well-being is right at your fingertips.
This is the intention of El Corte Inglés, which has just opened a shopping centre in Callao (Madrid) with an area of over 1000 m2, offering a wide range of body care services.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where prestigious companies such as Hedonai, dealing with laser hair removal, Spaxión, spaces for relaxation and aesthetic procedures, Luis & Tachi peluqueros, Marina d'Or with gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and others are located.
There is also a nutrition department and, above all, a tea room offering more than 130 different kinds of tea.
You can enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying the view of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and arrange your own 'beauty party' with up to eight friends, relax in a hot tub, get a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of the variations of Spaxion.
The total area is 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, which provide the above services as well as the latest procedures for facial and body care and hydrotherapy.
For example, we can use cavitation, which is used to fight cellulite, or vibration platforms.
The gym is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers who monitor the individual actions of the clients and thus provide completely individual care.
It all starts by inserting your personal key into the contact display, which is located opposite the machine.
Then you can watch the video demonstrations that will show you how to do our exercise set correctly.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is sufficient to exercise all the muscles.
And if after exercise you want to go to the hairdresser, Luis & Tachi has a space where you can do individual procedures to restore your hair, improve its shine and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionalism are the ambitions of this urban wellness centre, which is open every day from 10am to 10pm.

Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have set up 'LIVE Office'.
The project is aimed at developing and promoting electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE' (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) office will establish and manage the roadmap for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, gather views and results from the activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project to introduce electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to promote the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan Government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous region.
This includes energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in terms of promoting electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero foresees a 'quiet period' for the car industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the country, will face a "quiet period".
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures that were implemented during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would be in a state of neglect today, with the closure of some of our main manufacturing plants", the Prime Minister said.
'Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue operating in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector,' he added.
In this context, he pointed out that the competition plan, which forms part of the Integrated Automotive Plan (IAP), allocated 800 million for projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which mobilised investments in excess of EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government's measures on the aid requirement and mentioned the Plan 2000E, which is implemented in cooperation with the autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has made it possible to reduce by 6% the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has ensured a 'significant increase' in registrations, namely by '40%' in November.
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Car Show will open in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the motoring world.
The initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion in Madrid.
It is a 20,000 square metre exhibition space, which will be represented by more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars, but ClassicAuto Madrid will also have all kinds of products related to the motor world.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc. The exhibition will be held in the second half of the year.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
The following companies will be involved:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, refurbishment; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and refurbishment; or Cochera Clásicos, a Mercedes Benz specialist.
External competence tests
In addition, the commercial activities of the salon will be complemented by parallel activities: training, sporting events, competitions, presentations and competitions.
The same qualification tests will be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles on a customized circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: keeping the sporty style
Mazda wants to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on sportsmanship.
And that's why the Mazda3 has a built-in stop-and-start system - also called Stop-a device that's currently only available with a 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterised by good characteristics, which it has achieved as a whole.
The surface finish, the vehicle design, the occupation, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent in the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, are ergonomically excellent and perfectly secured.
The steering wheel is also extremely delicate.
Using the tooling and console assembly, we can conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend of developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style that also features the Honda Civic.
So we can say that the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, are in contrast to the sobriety of the German products and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which they all want to beat.
As usual, this compact Japanese product is more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, the large luggage compartment and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop-start system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and a 150 hp six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat, very gentle, with a reduced noise level, a lower power output and a lower fuel consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in a diesel version, those who do not drive that many kilometres a year should not rule out this petrol-powered i-Stop, as it is characterized by greater ride comfort and reduced fuel consumption.
As regards the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of production elements.
The main items of equipment to be mentioned are the lane-tracking system (RVM) to prevent blind spots, the traction and stability control, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the large-screen on-board computer, the parking sensors, the separate air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and bluetooth audio and the 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with Pack Premium, for an extra €1,500: adaptive dual-xenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
The conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its class.
It is characterised above all by the quality of the materials used, its operation and its high level of equipment.
And in addition, people who don't drive more kilometres a year can opt for this i-Stop version, which is only 2.0 petrol engine and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is EUR 21,770 for the Luxury and EUR 23,270 for the Sporty version.
At this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
The luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, as soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were shining more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the 'Nine' brand.
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, has chosen the dark 'lady'.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it's only used to view mail, without the ability to view a specific type of attachment or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Following its success, the company started offering two new devices: one dedicated exclusively to Twitter, the other based on a continuously provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
The FonPeek, which was unveiled at Le Web yesterday, is the European version of the invention and also its third variant.
It's limited, like its American counterpart, but it's surprising.
The monthly maintenance fee is around EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Smartphone travellers already know what it's like to lose data services after crossing borders or to be impatient to find a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price rooming is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, you'd need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them, and very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for the reduction of roaming charges so that they are accessible to all Europeans, which still has no desired effect.
There is a legitimate concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (which is interesting, it is still called Fon when it has no WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers with whichby compensating their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications. I'm not going to be a cop.
This device is connected and is paid for at the time of purchase, not months later.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen one day with FonPeek, it's a permanent access purchase option like Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking my mail on my phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's the best type from a consumer standpoint.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color that Michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
She chose this color for Barack Obama's inauguration and the same color for his coat and dress, and she chose this color for the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar designs in both cases: apart from being a similar color - yellow-green with glossy effects - in both cases it was a three-piece suit - dress, bag and coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of an Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The material of the garment makes the two models very different.
For the inauguration, Michelle wore a large lace, in Oslo, velvet with a print.
It changes and accessories: green shoes with medium heels, similar to the current model, but in gold.
She also wears different hairstyles: this time, a bridle, before that, a loose hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, particularly among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and the working career of Spanish women' carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study highlights that there are many differences in opinion on the number of children at the beginning of cohabitation, depending on whether they are working or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job start living with their partner earlier, have their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are putting off cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer children.
'Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years after the start of their life together with their partner.This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone their life together and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on maternity, although it has a smaller influence on the time of initiation of cohabitation", explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is their level of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women with primary and secondary education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and have their first child before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or tertiary education go the other way and prefer to get a stable job before they marry and have their first child", says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious roster of executives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm worth it'.
The Joyeux Noël hostess, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other L'Oréal Paris celebrities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the elite club was joined by actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the Hut').
The men's section of the brand is also represented by prominent figures: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox ('Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered for the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was named Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicent donates in 'Poker of Aces' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente) thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life).
He does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey is exciting, and Vincent spares no fear or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even when read over and over again.
Here are some observations.
About Albert Camus: "In the pages of this book I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the pleasure of contrary destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote by his own nature and not by his intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him".
On Graham Green: "Our man has been driven by passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by the path of damnation".
"This Odyssey, published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature to be climbed from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall".
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said he was the heir to the county manor, and he said he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, they were big dreams".
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer has captured the mad cry of this Munich man on the bridge to echo it into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running from himself and calling to the future and sharply speaking to the worms".
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make sure I stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were inscribed the words of Spencer: 'After effort comes a dream, / After storm a calm harbor, / After war a rest, / After a full life death".
On Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression with him in his suitcase.
Her husband was quite willing to let her tell him that Edward VII had followed her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
"Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness".
On Pío Baroja: "What else was Martín Santos interested in but focusing Joyce on Baroja?
What else did Bennett want, other than to have Barrow executed with a Faulkner gun?
What else did Celus want but to become famous at the expense of the man's fame?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people, aged 15 to 18, passed by and our dog, a crossbreed rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was kicked twice without a word and severely injured.
Our outrage is all the greater that we see nothing amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which was also on a lead.
And to add to the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on the walk, she began to worry for her own safety, because such a demon-possessed person who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint with the nearest police station, but we doubt that it was of any use, and to avoid raising any delicate questions, we note that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
Outraged, we made the announcement.
We don't understand what's happening to today's youth when they're having fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't understand what happened to good manners, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for using helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, as both bodies have announced today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet as it is the only way to prevent head injuries and deaths in motorcycle accidents.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of its road safety commitments, which 'means more than designing and producing even safer products', and confirms that it is also trying to achieve this aim by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase of placing signs on more than 500 motorcycles being repaired to bring awareness to the wider public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that road safety 'is a constant problem' for the company, which is a producer of tyres for two-wheelers and whose main objective is to continuously improve the safety of its products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is starting to recover.
The total number of 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represented an increase of 12,6% compared to 2008, and moreover, the first increase after 22 months of continuous decline, according to figures from the Anfac producer and dealer association Ganvam.
However, it is better to quarantine the positive figure, as November 2008 is a very poor period for comparison and represented a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% lower than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, covering all possible vehicles falling within the light commercial vehicle category: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, small lorries and light trucks/wagons.
And the clouds, which are the biggest detriment to demand, have not disappeared, even though they were bought by private individuals, the majority of purchases were made by SMEs and almost 100% of the purchases were financed through third parties.
In addition to the constraints resulting from the closure of the bank's source of credit, other factors such as the cessation of operations or the continuation of the economic downturn are also necessary.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
Apart from private individuals, the business list should also include SMEs intending to purchase light commercial vehicles of up to 3,5 tonnes with CO2 emissions below 160 g/km, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us again that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and also industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association expects that in 2010 the trend will be similar to last year, with sales of passenger cars and 4x4s falling by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the hand brake is already mandatory.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, the ESP stability control, the manual brake assist systems, will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it is already a compulsory component of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for others the deadline for the removal of the shortage is set, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary braking system increases the emergency brake pressure, which is detected by the system after the driver steps on the brake.
But he can't always keep the pressure on until the end.
According to a study by car parts manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not brake before a collision, and half of them did not use the brake to their full potential.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum from the braking system, it shortens the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal pedestrian accidents could be avoided each year.
The reduction in this number will be even more marked - one in four accidents involving persons would be avoided, according to calculations - once so-called intelligent hand braking systems are introduced.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system which detects (by radar or camera) obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even when the collision cannot be prevented, the device shall exert as much braking as possible and minimise the risk of damage.
General Motors is postponing the Opel plan until January.
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva would start in the first week of April - probably on 8 April - as Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer, warned that he would need more time to complete the renewal plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed with the party concerned first.
As a result, the final document, which will be submitted first to the employees and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, may be issued at the latest at the beginning of 2010.
On the contrary, GM assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken in these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM is making contacts with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that no agreement could be reached with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains in force if the sale is not successful.
Driving with the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, the Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus showing a weight of only 1,275 kg.
The basis was, firstly, an automatic retractable roof in canvas with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; aluminium doors such as GT3 were also used, reducing the weight by 15 kg; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a further reduction of the weight by 7 kg; the addition of sports seats, an additional 12 kg, thanks to the lighter 19-inch wheels, added five kg.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with fabric handles means another kilogram.
Also available with a two-speed PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-shaped six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on California's second-class roads, on mountain sections with many tangled corners.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing the weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press against the asphalt.
On the contrary, we haven't tested a model that small and light, that can deliver such safety in a corner, even at high speeds, for a long time.
He's a little athlete who can warm up his muscles in a short run for as long as he needs, until we order him to sprint, brake, and restart the engine...
Whatever we want, with a steering wheel that's as communicative as it is precise, whatever we point our hands at the wheel, that's what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of the 320-horsepower V6 boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and by a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which has already been used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether it's suction or recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive on with the Boxster Spyder was pretty badly damaged, but the car made good on the bumps.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we encountered frost and gravel at dawn and even in the late morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, because it's more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for €70,831.
'Bag girl' is the name of the song.
A friend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon line and an occasional starlet at the company's shows, the singer displays her bad girl face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than Bad Girl or It Girl, it's Bag Girl.
Bashan has won victories in Israel
The Labour Treasurer scored a brilliant 82-91 win at the complicated Maccabi Electra Stadium, despite numerous absences from Dusk Ivanovic's squad, and thus rose to the top of her group after Mirza Teletovic's great performance, which was declared the best in the squad with eight triple points (29 reviews).
The Vitorians were able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micho with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The game started with the blue team, who were on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for the Vitori were from a distance already suggested that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were in the lead 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavas opted for Barac's inside play and Eliyahu's work, who was greeted with a whistle and applause upon returning to his original position to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already showing himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although the 'without six' in Splitter's rating already indicated that it would not be the best night for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was fierce until the break, it was not decided in the least, and the Maccabians wanted to remind Vitori that not everyone wins on their pitch, and they managed to win 'by the hand of Elias'.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the 'yellow' to the sunshine (50-49).
More unsuitable
The Ivanovic members, injured but not at all dead, needed a few accurate games to catch their breath, and then appeared the machine gunner Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the help of Englisch and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring number (54-67), which they reached at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavas have been in a tight spot in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced they will not let anyone take away their well-deserved results in the first 30 minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter eliminated for a foul, Ivanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis came close to the final minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
The wounds are making Unica unable to fight.
Unicaja lost heavily to Olympiacos in Greece, leaving them in the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all an in-house game ((Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malayan community was not intimidated by the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or by the rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The first quarter gave the Andalusians a dream, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive three-pointers, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillaume Rubia, lighting up the field with a 12-18 to nine.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unica, although the home team's arsenal in an internal game with Bourousis, Vuccic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, in the 13th minute, which was the moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams opponents meant the elimination of both players.
The Greek team started to work and proved its superiority in both zones where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and the three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja team
Between the home team and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, the three-point margin was increased to 44-32, 19 minutes.
No chance of retaliation
The third part was very aggressive by Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to close the gap from the Malaga 66-48 match, in the 27th minute, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absence and recent absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages, Unicaja, with a lead and three points from Cook and Lewis, was left with a clear hope for a 66-57 win, in the 31st minute.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, with reinforcements and inches of lead in their zone, proved to be unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the basketball average 81-62, in the 37th minute, and Unicaja invited and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can see the salary they deserve for their profile with the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified real estate, job and motor vehicle ads in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates users' salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available from Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where the profession, years of experience, age and city where the applicant wishes to work should be entered.
Within a week of the app's launch, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "felt poorly paid", explained Albert Rivera, responsible for the product Trovit, in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer gets 45,226 euros a year gross, the Frenchman 31,059, while the Spaniard gets 24,000.
Similarly, the driver earns a net annual salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with a net annual income of €11,592, followed by a salesman with €14,725, and a worker with €15,667.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil has set a date for Zelay's departure.
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The incumbent President shall leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27th, when his term ends, he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to seek asylum in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum that the "de facto" government, headed by Roberto Micheletti, had tried to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, since it is already a natural state of affairs in an environment where decision-makers make decisions about the future that is itself uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilise the market was to monetise debt by direct asset purchases and indirectly release liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets for depreciation.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their inconsistent liquidity policies, they are starting to throw a little sand in the bucket, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors are therefore questioning the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a return to the reduction of risk yields.
Stock market movements and corporate bond spreads have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to socialise private risk, which again affected public debt.
The pressure on quality is again on, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the preferred haven for investors, widening the differentiation of the euro area countries from Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom's downgrade.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty is not useless to silence moral risk-takers who have once again tried to weigh the conscience of those responsible for world economic policy in order to curb the devastating effects of the credit limit on employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving Day should be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs to regain power in the emirates, and as for Greece, we've seen that before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections, and a new government takes office.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It is pointless for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries to default on their commitments.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid, but has decided to extend the aid to the amount of EUR [...] million.
If, as expected, we are in the period before the normalisation of the transitional risk premiums, then after some excesses on the supported positions they would be within the expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt gaps will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If European disparities are reduced and ours are further widened, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote, and when our leading indicators force most of the financial services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upswing scenarios, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not bode well for the Spanish economy to see this warning fulfilled.
Again, it looks like a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, though for now, "Careful, driver friend".

President Ignacio Sánchez Galán of Iberdrola was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittees of the Chamber of Deputies, where he is currently discussing Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his speech, which was followed by that of Gas Natural-Fenosa's President Rafael Villaseca, Galán made a number of comments to the press on the proposal which he had submitted to the subcommittees behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another EUR 60 billion from that date to 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this were not the case, the investment would not be 60 billion but 95 billion.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade, investment must focus not on increasing production capacity but on distribution networks and international connections
From 2020 onwards, the question is changing and more performance will be needed.
Its offer is concentrated on gas and coal power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, in particular, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that a further 18,000 MW are needed, but with other 'supporting energies'.
Galan, who believes the Sustainable Economy Bill just passed by the government is in line with the line that the corporation has been demanding, refusing to let go of the royal decree to boost national coal consumption, which is opposed to climate change policies.
He considered that the 'clear long-term bet' in this sense, despite the 'precise' measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galan believes that investment decisions, even if long-term, must start now, because they are still maturing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins the 'handling' of Aer Lingus at 10 airports
The Ferrovial airport ground services subsidiary, Swissport, will act as the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet expired economically, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a Centre for Innovation in Intelligent Infrastructures.
The association envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will be allocated to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona is looking for its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at A$1,700 million (about EUR1,047 million).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief.
The 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast became the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a highway construction and concession company.
City Hall wants the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting a public-private partnership (PPP) to further develop the project in the Erns & Young business plan, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
Tendering is expected in May, with an investment of A$1,700 million (€1,047 million) and a final stage involving three companies with a significant presence in European construction.
The group called Transcity is run by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the latter, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
The Acciona group is being challenged by Northern Direct, represented by Laing O'Rourke, UK, Transfield, Australia, and Bouygues, France.
The third and last group to be included in the network is LBRJV, which is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the major civil engineering company Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatisation, but it has clear difficulties to enter other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy pursued by the Hochtief or Bilfinger mentioned above, apart from the Asian references, continues to be an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Other assets
ACCIONA is focusing on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector in question, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supply and desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Victoria at Waubra (192 MW) and runs a group of companies that builds and operates a desalination plant in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the joint energy to enter the construction and infrastructure operations areas.
A toll road, promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is to connect the Toowong Western Highway with the Kelvin Grove Ring Road (see map) by a 5 kilometre tunnel.
The calendar set by the local administration envisages the commissioning of the works in the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of the following year.
Although this toll crossing would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the works is planned only in 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still bringing in significant profits for Hochtief, as it announced yesterday a deal with the government estimated at $154 million.
The ACS will operate the national fibre optic broadband network infrastructure through its local branch in Leighton.
This situation will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and provide employment for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-story King George Tower project in Brisbane, Australia, which was just about to begin, and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, in Manchester, he will partner with Laing O'Rourke to build and operate two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
The FCC was awarded a $64 million tunnel in Slovenia.
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, won an allocation of EUR 64,5 million for the construction of a 2,1 km tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after the completion of the 130 million euro tunnel extension work in Bosruk, Austria.
In this way Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a commercial at Renfe
Renfe has assigned advertising and marketing services to Ms Rushmore for the last two years at an annual cost of approximately EUR 3 million, the railway company informed.
The contract includes an option to extend for 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that entered the competition announced by Renfe, of which four made it to the final round, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creating the ads for the past three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million for France Télécom for obstruction of competition
The French competition authority has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the Commission, the operator restricted competition from fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With these sanctions, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the Competition Authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French mobile operator remains a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, Orange's app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since the start
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since earned 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth most profitable clubs in the competition.
Manchester United are leading the table.
Manchester United are leading the table.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it's also a major source of income for the big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed EUR 5,362,5 million to 105 teams (12 of which are Spanish) that have participated in the event since its inception in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The White Club was the third club on the continent with the most money earned for participating, and the only one alongside AC Milan to win the top prize three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that charged the most money for last year's Champions League.
And that's despite losing both to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, is only the third country to earn the most money through Champions, despite having won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution of
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
For the current financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to generate €1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA allocates 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2,1 million.
In addition, those who reached participation received 3.8 million for their attendance alone, plus an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There are also prizes for the winner (€800,000) and the draw (€400,000 for each team).The eight semi-finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion will earn $9 million, while the runner-up will earn $5.2 million.
So, on a fixed payment, the club will make a minimum of $7.1 million and a maximum of $31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments of 337.8 million.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each TV market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the money allotted, the second 30%, the third 20%, and the fourth 10%.
The other half will be paid according to the number of matches played this year.
Nueva Rumasa is offering €61 million for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday announced details of its share offer, with which it intends to acquire a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not bind the making of an offer to the public for the purchase (option) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa is offering EUR 1,5025 per share, which it would pay over 10 years and for which it would pay interest on this deferral of 1% per annum.
Yesterday, Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros, which means Nueva Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumas, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to notify their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611,7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254,27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to change the structure of its leadership.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible takeover bids and to settle the legal fluctuations of its former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food company.
This is a newly created position, which will report directly to the group president.
And it's not without controversy, as the company continues to be mired in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than $230 million from Sos by Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that Sos will reveal new movements of funds in the coming months.
As for the Salazar loan, yesterday, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaj) testified before the National Court, confirming that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were destined.
CNMV authorises the option to exclude Paternina, which participated in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised an exclusion, involving Inversor Mer, for Federico Paternino on 9 October.
The Authority explained that it authorised this operation because it understood that its conditions were in line with the applicable standards and that it considered that the explanatory content of the brochure submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December was 'sufficient'.
The CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8,95% of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been frozen and could not be transferred in any way until the tender had been closed, specifying that the price had been set by Federic Paternino in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car valuation
These days, storms and accidents don't just make the auto repair companies money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance accident are towed to a service station, where an expert must estimate the damage and the cost of repairs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex job.
It can take two or three hours to calculate manually the cost of a repair, including parts and labor, from 20,000 to 30,000 euros.
However, with the help of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Providers of insurance event and maintenance estimation services and solutions are engaged in collecting information from manufacturers to develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain, Audatex, from the US group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other competitors in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Audatex's commercial director, there are 63 manufacturers and importers working in Spain, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies start working.
It's a very hectic job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the car and determine its price.
In addition, each model is equipped with 'intelligent' graphics processing', where the individual parts of the coaches can be 'pinned'.
In the case of a mass-market model, the work can be completed in a week if the process is very fast.
For a minor car, it may take three or four months.
The most exclusive models they have information on include Porsches, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
In the case of the fleet in circulation, they exceed 99%.
For the documentation and database work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) each specialising in a specific brand.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are processed every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this vast flow of information enables companies to make different uses and to provide different products.
The most common use is for repair and maintenance, but there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of a car, depending on the country.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, they do.
Taking into account the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to obtain support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus, the standard insurance event valuation solution for the knowledgeable, being the flagship product.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paint shop.
This instrument shall be paid by use for each assessment.
The maximum price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that does thousands of estimates negotiates their price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it has left the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet that allows the disposal of vehicles with a total insured event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have been serviced due to an accident or how many have suffered a serious insurance event over a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, inter alia, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group established in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, accident or maintenance of motor vehicles
The valuation guide is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in the service, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 they accounted for EUR 10,8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalisation began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its brother is generated in Europe and 38% in North and South America.
Worldwide invoicing of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, an increase of 3,3% compared to 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group was listed at $1 billion, and now its shares are estimated to be worth a total of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group acquired Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation involved subscribing to EUR 59.5 million of the company's 85% capital, which could be increased by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, connoisseurs, rental companies, service companies, spare parts sales and professional sellers, who must register before starting operations.
The platform was set up in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been withdrawn cannot be returned to service but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Historic vehicles may be allowed to operate, although they have been withdrawn, after a preliminary ruling.
Budgeting the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user obtains the budget in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for a spare part, budgeting and budget ageneration.
Ease of use is a key condition for these systems, especially for convincing older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are tourist vehicles, 109 are off-road vehicles, 137 are motorcycles, 78 are vans and 44 are trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After identifying the model to be repaired by means of the chassis number, a real graphic representation of the model shall appear and the necessary spare parts shall be selected.
The user may include variables such as labour costs, overtime or discounts, and then print them out and pass them on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include estimates of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working on making this image three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are welcoming, because it allows you to, for example, pick a door and turn it around to see the inside.
