Tatoeba guidelines recommend that members either add sentences in their native language or translate from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to make natural-sounding sentences in their native language. When writing in a language other than their native language, it is very easy to form strange-sounding sentences. We ask that you translate a sentence only if you know for sure what it means.
