In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: where voters isolate themselves in a booth, and place a pre-printed sheet of paper stating their right to the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
Once the officials verify the identity of the voter , the voter places the envelope inside the ballot box, and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure with unfavorable rigor.
Since 1988, the ballot box has had to be transparent so that voters and observers can make sure that there are no conditions at the start of voting, and that no conditions are added except for the conditions of registered and authorized voters by assets and commissioners.
Candidates can send representatives to supervise each part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under intense supervision following specific procedures.

When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it at approximately the same time.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere around Earth distorts some light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to put a satellite or telescope in space.

There are a lot more medium-sized cats feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer to deer .
Finally, there are many small mammals (including stray pet cats) that eat smaller prey that is more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
The lions are the most social and live in large groups called herds.
The family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.

When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main group of the population to which they belong (e.g. if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island where they cannot easily return), they will, often, find themselves in a different environment from the one in which they were previously.

The Aborigines have not changed at all, so they still require the same methods of adaptation as we have known them.
Over time, as newcomers begin to adapt to their new surroundings, their similarity to other populations gradually decreases.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will have formed so different that we cannot call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are considered to be the inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide which humans produce (i.e. sulfur).
The plants recover their sunlight through the light constructs. They also provide shade.

Production has continued to the present day, but more importantly, the shape of the image sensors in digital cameras has inherited the ratio of the image width to its height.
The 35 mm model is actually, a bit confusing, at 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of the dimensions of this image is (when dividing by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest positive integer) so it is 3:2.
Many common formulas (such as the Advanced Picture System formulas) have a ratio of width to height equal to or near that.
The often-misused and often-laughed-at rule of triangulation constitutes a simple guiding principle that creates dynamics while maintaining some degree of order in a clear picture.

They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting against the king and queen .
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their car to their windows .
Some time a gang member waved the head of one of the Royal Guards killed in Versailles in front of the panicked Queen.
Filipino people have paid the cost of the US imperialist war by invading the Philippines.
These were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime in order to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses .
Of course, the huge profits generated by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the main gains of US imperialism.

The era in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages and is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which all ended around 1500.

There are two general ideas in common in most explanations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on embedded societies, rather than on society as a whole.

Labo, la construcción de una red de carreteras a lo largo del país no tiene ninguna ventaja económica si hay pocos coches, por lo que se están desarrollando nuevas formas de reducir el costo de la propiedad de un coche.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, leading to the development of new technologies in health care to treat the affected people.
The Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism derived from writers such as Goethe, Vishte, and Schlegel.

Paris being the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
La fama de ser un centro de lujo se inició en el año 400 d.C. y se prolongó hasta el año 1100 d.C.
Its decline during the 12th century was primarily due to the fact that the Crusades returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were much more valuable than what Byzantine markets brought.
"Paris" was at the time called the "fashion capital" instead of "Constantinople".
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th or 11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.

Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is grown to produce enough food for the farmer and his family only.
Subsistence agriculture - which is often neither fertilizer nor poisons - is a simple system in which stored seeds that are appropriate to the local ecosystem are used, in addition to crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques with the goal of increasing yield.
Most farmers have historically worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of age, race, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The traits that define the distinctiveness of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, ethnic, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership by various symbolic uses of style, including clothing, costumes, and terminology.
One of the most common ways used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, misfortune, or wilful abuse, from being socially disconnected from adults during their upbringing.

Wild children may have been abused as children or traumatized before being abandoned or fled.
Others say they were raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the behaviour of a feral child (within the physical limits) is very similar to the behaviour of a special care animal, such as fear of or indifference to humans.

Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather a means of providing support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and real-world, in other words, the instructor is a form of interactive learning, as is the paper clutter in Microsoft Office.
The program supports interactive learning and aims to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that might be difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, to extortion.

"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied the public reaction to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting microfacial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
It is especially claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the exact expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, pointed out that the speech of the president suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
Rather, he suggests that these abilities in analyzing human behavior are shared by some animals, such as pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown the existence of two groups of Chinese varieties: a hidden group and a second phenomenal group.
The mutation adds new genetic variants, which are removed by selection from the expression variants pool.
The process of separation and rearrangement makes the random variation between the two sets more likely with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have difficulty obtaining their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so can lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most widely available plant resources are proteins that we can get from paper and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
Conversely, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way similar to the way the chimpanzee solved it in the savannah.
Sleep apnea is a process whereby you deliberately wake up during your normal sleep cycle and fall back to sleep after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this easily with a relatively quiet alarm that will bring you back to consciousness without fully recovering.

The second, biologically based option, involves drinking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
As stress diminishes , the positivity increases . Everyone has the potential to find peace and satisfaction .
Everyone can reach enlightenment.The only thing that keeps us from reaching this goal is our stress and negativity.

This war was supposed to last for the next forty years, and to be fought on the ground, by proxy armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.

Though, these plans were obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 Red Army troops entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure that your country is able to transport its people and goods, while at the same time, preventing the enemy from transporting their people and goods.

Meanwhile, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion and its weapon was the use of submarines.

Seems like the goat was first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran .
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them because milk, hair, meat and leather were easily available.
The domesticated goats were generally reared in herds that roamed hillsides or secondary grazing areas, often by goat herders, often children or teenagers, in the same widely known herding method. These methods of herding are still used today.
Carriageways were developed in England as early as the 16th century.
Though early railway carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull heavier loads than roads which were considered more cumbersome at the time.

This has become a common practice, but the iron has made the wooden wheels of the carts wear even more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron bars were introduced.
Walk was the first means of transportation. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, coincidentally with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not move consistently vertically.
Species with two legs have been found in the fossils of the Australopithecus 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the coastal anthropoid may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

"We made between 150 and 200 copies overnight, now known as the Dunlap Cash Bulletins".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
They sent one to George Washington on July 6, and it was read to him by troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The Dunlap 25 Folding Foldings are the oldest surviving copies of the United States Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version no longer exists.
Today , many paleontologists believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.We call them birds.
Lots of people don't think they were dinosaurs because they had feathers and could fly.

They have protective outer legs and claws, are white, and walk on their hind legs like a leopard.
All computers in use today are based on binary-digit encryption.
A binary number can have only one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, if we use the terminological computer language.
Endotoxicity may not be immediately apparent, so a rapid diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as diarrhea are sufficiently common.

Insurgentes usan el término " insectos " en su sentido oficial para referirse a este grupo de insectos.
The term is derived from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, insects that are highly adapted to infesting humans.
Killer bugs and bed bugs are both characterized by long incubation periods, and adapt to living in a nest or in the dwelling of their host.

The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not unique in this regard, an experiment is a test that can be used to test the validity of one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
They accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West saw itself as isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Much of the rhythm observed in physiology and behaviorology is often critically dependent on the existence and production of self-cycles through biological clocks.
They have documented periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, in most organisms, including those of bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that persist for periods of consecutive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey-Chess experiment was one of the major evidence for DNA being a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used pathogens or viruses to introduce their own DNA into germs.
Two experiments were performed to either label the DNA of the pathogen using radioactive phosphorus or to protein it with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are enzyme-linked cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, whereas mutations in other sites can cause cell death or cancer.
Turismo natural atrai gente interessada a visitar zonas naturales para disfrutar de la vista, incluyendo flora y fauna silvestre.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem information.
To do so is to visit, photograph, and learn about this species of monkey (organgatuangs) in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to their work places and meet other people working in the place they just left .
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone supports and is somewhat connected to a transport system based on private cars.

Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Everybody complains about the transportation system.
Rarely in developed countries do you hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges .
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, and not fail every day?Are transport engineers inefficient?Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of motorists and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Sadly, studying traffic is difficult because it is not possible to predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic enjoys a reasonably consistent range, and can be expressed mathematically approximatively.
To better describe traffic flow, they made connections between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly through the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to fold their wings backward along the body.

The existence of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper has been known since ancient times, where all these elements can be detected in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle posited that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transformed into new materials to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
elements such as calcium and potassium are considered minerals. There are of course minerals such as silver and gold as well.
