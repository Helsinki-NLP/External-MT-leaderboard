Traffic is a concept for pedestrians and cyclists in two points of intersection.
Unfortunately, learning the direction of traffic is difficult because the motorist's actions do not cause significant injuries.
Of course, motorists often fall into the same category; therefore, traffic directions often have the same smooth settings as can be mathematically represented.
To indicate the correct direction of traffic, three important variables have been proposed: (1) direction, (2) load, and (3) speed.
