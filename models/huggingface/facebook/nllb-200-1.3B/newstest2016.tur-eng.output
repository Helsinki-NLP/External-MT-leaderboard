Professor admits to killing his girlfriend by calling 911
University professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that police should come to the houses, in a voice that was only slightly trembling.
Lamb noted that his "cute dog" was alive and probably sad, and that the phones of the deceased woman's family could be found on the woman's cell phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss' lifeless body in the house and a note in a white notebook signed by Lamb, which read: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it all back, I loved Amy so much and she was the only woman who ever loved me", officials said.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had given two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the campus where he thought the police's beloved history professor, Ethan Scmidt, had also been shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard gunfire at 10:18.
He also said that Lamb made the alarming 911 call shortly after.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
A day after the school shooting left students and professors hiding behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what prompted Lamb to do so.
The details, as well as the investigative officers on both sides of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, painted a picture of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal or criminal record.
Schmidt even referred to Lamb in one of his books as one of the "great people" he shared his academic life with.
Both had taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members are listed, and many students had taken lessons from both.
However, there were also signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who spoke highly of Lamb, noted that he was also a nervous and tense person and "seemed to have a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he struggled with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, citing some medical issues.
She's only been teaching two classes online this year.
Recent changes to the university's hiring policies did not automatically guarantee Lamb a full-time faculty member despite the doctorate he worked hard to earn.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that it was "obvious that Lamb had something on his mind".
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was cleared, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Director of Forensic Investigation Methel Johnson said that Lamb committed suicide in the backyard of a home about a mile from his family's home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, with a single .38-caliber handgun before Lamb was arrested.
Lamb's car was found on the highway working.
While it was not immediately clear why Lamb had visited the house, Johnson stated that he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in the house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the 3,500-student university in the city of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
She got her doctorate in education this spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through their associates.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a great-looking guy who tried to teach her how to play guitar for a few years.
He was a heartthrob back then.
Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, told Lamb, "When he came, all the girls would melt".
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
While Lamb said "I killed my wife" on the 911 call, there's no official record of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in their brick house by a river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was in good condition.
And Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said that they divorced 15 years ago, but that he and Prentiss were always friends, and that they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter was completely devastated.
She and her mother were great friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail were performing at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together at public shows.
O'Steen stated that his daughter wrote and sang the music herself.
Prentiss was a nurse working for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who is a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a sloppy bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished playing guitar and music to a small crowd.
There was no sign of a problem.
He said they were a pretty happy couple.
Sometimes we'd cut each other off and throw a line.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at the same university, noted that the murdered professor Schmidt directed a seminar program for freshmen and was an expert on Native American and colonial history.
He was married and had three teenage children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a student solidarity group he founded.
About 900 people attended the candle-laying ceremony on Tuesday night on the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, including academics, university staff, students, and visitors from the local community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial, where the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Magnificent Grace".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
LaForge said, "We're trying to get our students back".
The crisis is over.
It's time to dress up.

Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to this story.
This news article has been edited to reflect the fact that police stated that Lamb called 911 after killing Schmidt and that there was no official evidence that the two were married, even though Lamb referred to Prentiss as his "wife" in the 911 call.
Toys R Us plans to buy less holiday season stuff
Toys R Us announced it would not hire as many holiday-season employees this year as it did last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said the company would offer more work opportunities to existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to employ 40,000 people at its stores and distribution centers nationwide, up from 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates would begin this month and staff numbers would increase from October to December.
With the holiday shopping season still months away, companies are preparing to equip their stores and hire temporary workers to help them sell, ship and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox joked about his "relationship" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
He describes it in the trailer for the documentary Back in Time, which will enter a new vision: "We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I noticed that the seat next to me was empty and I knew that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and arm-stroke away from me.
Back in Time, a documentary about the film "Back to the Future", features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future first came into view 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie ever made for me".
Back in Time will be shown in VOD and DVD formats as well as in select theaters.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
On Russia's growing military support to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the nearly five-year-old Syrian problem "cannot be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons would only lead to more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together to find a political solution to the issue and hold constructive talks.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned to hold talks on Syria with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the UN General Assembly, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France, at the UN General Assembly's executive session, which is scheduled for the end of the month.
It expressed deep regret that the division between the members of the council and the Syrian people had made the regional powers "unable to resolve the problem".
Ban invited the five permanent members to unite in the Syrian crisis, as in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Polls That Show Donald Trump is Serious
Some have tried to label it a volcano.
The others accused him of being a joke.
And some are supporting the internal explosion.
Some Republicans tried to bring Donald Trump down in the polls, but it didn't work.
The latest 11 national polls put him in double-digit numbers ahead of Donald Trump, and some are beginning to seriously question the real estate emperor's chances of running.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise in 2011 was also a reason for Herman Cain's rise, both of whom failed to win a single state nomination.
And there are many reasons why he's gonna have trouble in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the economic conservative group Growth Club are realizing Trump's enduring power and are starting to spend their dollars trying to topple him.
Here are some recent poll results that show the real estate emperor is not just a temporary presence:
Trump's approval ratings have shifted 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll conducted at Monmouth University showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a favorable view of the real estate emperor.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
Out of roughly 10, three of them express a negative opinion.
And these numbers are rising in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa, showed that 60 percent of Republicans there favored Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters are likely to be happy with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were elected.
Only two out of 10 said they'd be "sad" if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is as enthusiastic as Trump (43% said they would be "enthusiastic", compared to 40% for Trump).
The other person closest to the enthusiast?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "displeased" or "saddened" if the party's favorite Jeb Bush were elected.
The majority of Republicans don't see Trump's humor as a problem.
Donald Trump is being criticized for his flashy language and insults, and according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republicans polled think the real estate empire has the right temperament to be president.
The same is true in Iowa, where the nation's first party convention is being held, where Quinnipac said last week that 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to lead.
Forty-four percent still think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say his mood doesn't match the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who the best candidate was to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best.
That's a change from the end of July, when four out of 10 people put their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ball of GOP voters has been less clear.
In the last election cycle at that time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be the candidate, while only 28 percent voted for Mitt Romney, who ended up being the candidate.
It still seems that the majority of GOP voters find Trump's campaign reasonable.
Even if the Republicans rally around another candidate, Trump still wins almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the splintered field may also contribute to Trump's rise, and it's also true that anti-Trump support is spread across more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a possible head-to-head match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump has won the majority support each time.
He's beating Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a tie, Ben Carson outscored his businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump said they locked their ballots.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can say they're not really going to change their minds.
46% said they'd leave the door open for a change.
Trump's biggest rival is still brain surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made their decision are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapeurs" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the top and center of conversations in 2016.
Some believe Trump's over-speech is driving important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and will hurt his efforts to rebrand.
But a new ABC/Post poll on Monday found that six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration is on the agenda, it looks like Trump will be on the agenda.
Anger at the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson, largely due to their outsider status, are roughly halfway to the Republican vote.
In a new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they'd rather have someone from the outside than someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry at Republicans in Congress, 54 percent "dissatisfied", and 21 percent "extremely angry".
Jeremy Corbyn will speak for the first time in the Prime Minister's Questions
Mr Corbyn's appearance on the Prime Minister's Question Time programme has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the new Labour Party, will take the floor for the first time since David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will be asking six questions shortly after noon, and his performance looks set to be closely watched by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more reality" at the weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's silence at the reading of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been criticised by some Tory MPs and is the focus of front-page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he stood in "respectful silence" and appreciated "the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle of Britain".
But Owen Smith, one of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet members, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
While about a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's senior team because of differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, less than one-sixth of those in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant notes that political differences within the Labour Party are also "gathering" and these include Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union position and the government's implementation of an upper limit on aid.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had proposed new changes to the top limit, to remove it altogether.
Hours later, the shadow minister for work and pensions, Mr Smith, said the party was only against the government lowering the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000 and was "very clear" on the matter.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the House of Commons since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader promised a different approach to politics, saying he had "people-sourced" and more than 30,000 suggestions to ask Mr Cameron.
Islington North MP told the PM that the Questions programme was too cumbersome and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people rather than "response education" and a sarcastic exchange of words.
Mr Corbyn has said that when he is not present, for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad, he will be represented by the shadow trade minister Angela Eagle on the Prime Minister's Questions programme.
He even suggested that other colleagues come to the podium from time to time, and he said he had approached Speaker John Bercow to discuss the matter.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron expressed a desire to move away from the "puppet-style" politics often associated with the Prime Minister's Questions programme, but admitted a few years later that he had failed in that regard.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions programme has been used as a primary gauge for measuring leaders' decision-making abilities, their power in the House of Commons and their position among MPs, although some critics have expressed that this has been caricatured and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
'Filmed in Joburg': homeless youths are being trained in photography
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place for the homeless.
But a group of former street kids found a way to earn a living by acquiring a new talent.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their neighborhoods and make a living out of it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound is rising as UK wage increases accelerate.
The FTSE 100 index rose following the bid for SABMills, while the pound rose rapidly following data showing higher wages in the UK.
Wages, excluding premiums, in the UK increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which represents the fastest increase since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest rate increases.
The pound sterling gained more than 1% against the US dollar to $1,5505 and against the euro by 0.84% to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index rose by 1.49% to 6,229.21 points.
The most notable company in this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase in sales with an attractive acquisition offer from its rival AB InBev.
This proposal will bring together the two largest breweries in the world, and will bring together the best-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under one roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9 percent, driven by positive earnings news from rival luxury retailer Richemont.
Richemont's recent sales figures have shown that, in addition to exceeding expectations, sales in China, one of Burberry's key markets, have started to rise again.
Shares of mining giant Glencore rose 5% after it announced it had raised $2.5 billion from the sale of its allotment shares as part of the company's debt-reduction strategy.
Shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the most depreciated, with a 4.3% loss, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its offer for the company to "Sale".
JD Sports' stake rose 3.1 per cent after announcing the company's six-month pre-tax profit had risen 83 per cent to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill said higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But he said that he felt that his spending power would not be enough to cover the high employee costs of his company.
He added that the costs would affect JD Sports' expansion plans, and that this would mean less extra work.
Metcash launched a grassroots campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash has launched a public campaign to defend its retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open the first of two distribution centres and 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, with Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and trying to build the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide fair.
IGA's bakers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer Simmo, which offers taste testing in IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell discount South Australian Football League tickets to their loyal customers.
Food, beverage and equipment wholesaler Metcash is expected to provide more details on its defense strategy as it edits its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is large, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint and produce higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australia and Western Australia store owners are negatively narrow-minded, and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they do in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in GA and 24% more in the UAE than in the eastern states.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that within 12 months of Aldi opening its first stores in these two states, it will capture about 5% of the grocery market, taking sales from existing players but generally unremarkable retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers will lose $360 million in a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This is based on Aldi's forecast to open 25 stores in GA and 30 in the UAE next year, and to achieve sales figures of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
Mr. Kierath noted that the loss of food and grocery sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes.
Metcash is also losing market share in the eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research that found IGA customers to be the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and grocery sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016 and 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, which will bring its market share down from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could very likely be wiped out in ten years".
Metcash declined to comment on Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's earnings from its food and grocery business, which supplies around 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43% since 2012, an indication that the operating leverage ratio is declining as sales and margins come under pressure.
But the wholesaler is resisting, investing more than $150 million a year in Coles and Woolworths for shelf prices that match hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers renovate their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and opening up a better-labelled specialty store chain to the public.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price matching and store renovation programs are starting to pay off, and wholesale is expected to return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more than criticism for her behavior.
According to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis' friend Nick Kyrgios was the casualty of the recent storm that hit the area and deserves much praise.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself in the unwelcome spotlight after Kyrgios crushed Stan Wawrinka in a face-tossing manner at the Montreal Masters.
In the afternoon's tough elimination match in Cincinnati, when Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the referee, Harrison declared: "Wawrinka came over Kyrgios and I have to go over that kid".
Kokkinakis, who was last seen breaking his racket at the US Open, potentially to the displeasure of Richard Gasquet, was defended by Healy.
The youngster is currently competing for the second singles title against Great Britain in the Davis Cup semi-finals in Glasgow with Sam Groth.
Healy said, "What I feel is quite enthusiastically, is that I think Thanasi is a little bit involved".
He broke his racket when he was shut down and lost in the US, but he's not the first player to break his racket because he was disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi knows enough not to be proud of it.
But in reality, in the United States, he and Harrison and others have managed to do very well under extremely provocative circumstances, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team, a great family, and I think he's overreacted.
He's 19 years old, but he's extremely mature, he works hard, he fits in the team, he has no problems with the other players, he's very respectful in the locker room, he's doing hard training, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and in my opinion, he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to welcome Kyrgios for the important draw, starting Friday to explain that what is right for everyone is to "mutually decide" but to support Canberran for a return to the team as a long-term anchor.
Healy said, "We want the team to focus on the game, not the quarrels around [Kyrgios] first".
And I think that, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, the kid has risen up very quickly, he's growing up in the public eye and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's got, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not in the spotlight, he's thinking deeply that my idea is appropriate, that it's best for the team and for him.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detained migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to stem the flow of migrants, closing its southern border with Serbia and detaining those trying to enter the country illegally.
With hundreds of migrants gathering in the neutral zone, chaos was created at the border and Serbian authorities acted in anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries have camped on the roadside between the two countries' checkpoints for an indefinite period of time.
But their anger grew.
As a police helicopter passed overhead, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian Agile Force police.
Others rejected the water and food they were given in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that Hungary's return of migrants from Macedonia and Greece, while the flow of migrants continues, is "unacceptable".
(Serbia) does not want to suffer from this process, but to be part of the solution.
In the coming days, talks will have to be held with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border came just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who have invaded Greece and Italy, and they spoke of the hope that by the end of next month or year, they would agree to accept 120,000 more migrants, including those from Hungary, into EU countries.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an EU summit next week to discuss the migrant crisis facing the continent.
Hungary is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call issued Tuesday in two southern regions gives authorities broad powers to deal with the crisis, including closing roads if necessary and speeding up asylum-seeking cases.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that after the barbed wire his country drew to the Serbian border, he planned to draw a barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from this country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that prison inmates were even being deployed to work on the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a major narrow passage and transit point to EU countries, and a large number of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of arrivals are "economic migrants" seeking to cross into Europe for a better life rather than innocent people fleeing war - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make it a crime to cross or damage a four-meter-long (13-foot) barbed wire that is drawn across the border from Serbia, and they also impose harsher penalties on people smugglers.
Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass migration".
We're very clear on one thing: it's a crime to cross the border illegally.
While the deployment still needs approval from the council, Associated Press reporters in the area have been reporting sightings of troops with dogs and vehicles armed with heavy weapons for days.
Orban's national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 who had entered the country.
They've broken through the barbed wire, are now in police custody and are charged with a crime under the new law.
Authorities are quickly repairing the barbed wire.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, using a barbed-wire train carriage to close one of the crossings.
The Hungarians had also started a small metal container, where people were crammed to carry out the operations, and the chaos was reflected at the main border crossing point near Roszke.
Twenty people got in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by closing the highway between Serbia and Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders is down to half in the national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton maintains a double-digit lead in the Democratic primary for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton currently holds 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%) while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, is getting 15% of the Democratic vote.
More than five months before the main race began, most Democratic voters were saying it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton's supporters have a stronger opinion of their own choices than other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton has been losing ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has had some gains.
Clinton leads by a wide margin between women and moderates, but that gap is closing.
Support among men has plummeted, and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton's under-50 Democratic electoral lead has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now on a par.
But Clinton is leading by a wide margin in terms of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading the Liberals by double digits over Sanders, but now Sanders is leading the pack by five points.
Nearly half of the nation's Democratic voters say they'd be passionate about Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter will support him on certain conditions, while another 15 percent will only support him if he is a candidate.
Six percent of the people don't support Clinton.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are especially inclined to support her passionately.
The opinions among those who do not support Clinton at the moment are even more mixed - only a quarter can support her passionately.
48 percent of Democrats say they will passionately support Clinton while fewer Republican front-runners talk about Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton supporters were asked open-ended questions about why they wanted Clinton to run, the top responses were that she had the right experience (16 percent), that it was time to elect a woman president (13 percent), and that she was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also cite his relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Being compromised in problems and being selectable are among the criteria.
As a potential vice president, 57 percent of Democratic voters might want to see him in the race, but one-third don't think so.
When Democratic voters are asked what their second-choice candidate for the party is, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden could have a second term by a wide margin, according to Sander.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points in a race with Biden to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that number is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden is second in this regard, but he's far behind, but the percentage of those who see him as the most likely candidate has increased.
Again, when asked what's most important about a candidate, Democratic voters put issues ahead of electability.
As with last month, no Democratic candidate or nominee seems to be a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or candidate candidates, perform well among their party's primary voters on some key characteristics.
The majority sees Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, as well as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the first of the three in terms of honesty, while Clinton is strong in terms of leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, and about half say the same for Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent have no idea.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in line with their own ideology.
By all measures, a quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders.
While questions continue about his use of his personal email address and server during his State Department duties, most Democratic voters find the statement to be satisfactory and say their views on him remain unaffected.
But that's a different story in the general American public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, while only a third find them satisfactory.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue was taken under the lens.
Most Americans say email arguments have not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36% say they have increased their negative opinions.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 say their views on Clinton are distorted.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her own party's voters, this is still a problem among registered voters in general: only 32% consider her honest and trustworthy, a figure that is down eight points from last month and down 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country don't think Trump is honest or trustworthy.
Yet both Clinton and Trump are getting good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the highest on honesty.
More often than not, Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, most of them have no idea who he is.
The margin of error in the samples from the 351 Democratic voters is 6 points.
Ben Carson is just behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running right behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that the two candidates have nearly half the votes to match, with the other candidates having little chance.
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising from 23 percent in the latest CBS poll before the Fox News debate last month to 27 percent in the poll released Tuesday.
But support for Carson has gone from 6 percent to 23 percent over the same period.
The poll also found Carson did very well in demographic groups, with support among college-educated Republican voters much higher than Trump.
The rest, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, have dropped from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
This latest poll, which included 376 Republican voters, had a margin of error of 6 percent and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week put Carson's support among Republicans at 19 percent, just behind Trump's 32 percent.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump seriously ahead of Carson.
Confronted with Carson's rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but continued to randomly wave at the retired brain surgeon.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday, "We need energy".
Five fraternity members accused of killing a freshman at Baruch College
Nearly two years after the death of a college student at a fraternity induction ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity violently attacked Chun "Michael" Deng at a September 2013 induction ceremony, and contributed to his death by delaying his hospital admission, according to police.
Authorities reported that he was blindfolded, strapped to a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and constantly caught chalk as he tried to walk to his goal in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that he had a headache over time and then lost consciousness.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity members didn't call 911 after Deng fainted, and police say they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But police commissioner Chris Wagner, speaking at a press conference, said they had in the meantime changed Deng's clothes, Googled his symptoms and contacted the national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng, for advice.
Lieutenant Wagner said that at this point, the members began to hide personal belongings and put the good of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't be revived and died the next morning.
An autopsy report found Deng suffered repeated blunt force trauma to the head, torso and hip.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that many families have been destroyed as a result of the fraternity admissions, with at least one student dying at admissions every year since 1970.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of the town of Monroe has recommended that the first five members be indicted on charges of murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault with a deadly weapon and criminal battery.
Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday that we will hold not only those involved but any organization that officially or unofficially confirms this to be responsible.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its association with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With rising interest rates, the bull market is upside down, bond yields are soaring, and the economy is in recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is when all this is going to happen and how long it's going to last.
History, especially in economics, offers little insight into timing.
The recession has occurred as soon as 11 months after the initial rate increase, and has lasted as long as 86 months.
The Fed's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has been, if not constant, usually determinative in the response of economic and financial assets.
It is this percentage that central bank officials in the United States have strongly emphasized that investors should focus on how long the normalization process will take, not when interest rates will start to rise.
It's a fact that there are different variables.
But the bottom line is that market participants may think that the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.
Julian Jessop, Global Chief Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients, "It is inevitable that the Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis is interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money.'"
On the contrary, we don't expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it appears that levels that are still low are the seismic shock that most fear.
Still, we can't say there won't be any effects.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy might react as follows:
As we've seen in the marketplace in recent months, waiting for interest rates to rise can temporarily destabilize things.
And when the interest rate is raised, the effect is not so obvious.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed's rate hikes, Deutsche Bank analysts say, "Commodity yields appear to be on a 12- to 24-month downward trend following the first rate hike, which may reflect a slowdown in monetary policy".
According to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, an analyst at Nuveen Asset Management, which he shared with Barron's, the market has generally seen sharp increases over the past 35 years - around 14 percent - moving in a straight line towards interest rate increases after 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent) and returning to normal after 500 days, yielding an average of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the effect on the shares became more pronounced in the later stages of the interest rate hike cycle, and the yields were on the verge of disappearing.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes help them.
The Fed is currently facing some unprecedented conditions that will accelerate the recession.
What's most striking is that the gross domestic product is at an all-time low for the Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, nominal gross domestic product has fallen below 4.5 percent only twice year-on-year, in the 118 percent increase since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, the Atlanta Fed said that few expected this to be permanent, with the third quarter at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and could lead to the question "will it be different this time around?"
Market participants who have been waiting for the Fed's rate hike for a year are focusing on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe the FOMC may approve a hike at this meeting, futures trading points to only a 25 percent chance.
"In our research since 1950, all cycles of growth to date have been in a super-upward trend cycle, with gross domestic product rapidly reaching pre-recession peaks after the initial recovery", the report said.
Rather, it was a slow recovery, the worst in a precedent-setting period.
The current cycle is the longest the Fed has waited since the last recession -- the longest on record is 35 months, and the cycle we're in is in its 74th month and it's still going on.
With the market expecting interest rates to rise, fixed income has become volatile and the structure is somewhat similar to that of the equity markets.
The difference is that when the Fed changes the direction of policy, the effect is seen more quickly in bonds than in stocks.
When the first up/down of the cycle comes, bond yields don't immediately change direction.
At the end of the cycle of interest rate increases, bond yields fall instantly", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab, a strategist, believes that the interest rate increases will smooth the trend, bringing the yields between longer and shorter-term bonds closer together.
We've analyzed that high-yield bonds generally perform better in this kind of environment, but we're still careful about reaching yield, said Kathy Jones, one of the Schwab analysts.
Interestingly, Jones thinks that the markets are already adjusting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated under tighter monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased -- all features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tighten policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
Multinational companies that are heavily indebted will be worse off, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market, and their debt will be more expensive.
In a report prepared for clients by Goldman Sachs analysts, they said, "History suggests that 'quality' stocks may experience a performance slump at the start of such a rise".
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent, following increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high-capitalization and low-float stocks also outperformed their low-quality competitors by an average of 4 to 3 percent.
The debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with high fluctuating exchange rate debt are most likely to suffer.
In addition to the pure stock market game, consumers are also projected to benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts differ on how quickly to save, savers can also profit from high earnings.
Andrew Bingham said it was a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accused the station of 'spoiling'
He argued that radio was becoming increasingly unlike its commercial competitors.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, accusing her of rigging the Brit Awards.
His deputy, Damien Collins, accused The Voice of not being original.
A senior representative pressured the broadcaster to highlight its difference from other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "turning to Classic FM".
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham told his bosses that the BBC's public service broadcaster was "getting weaker" and increasingly out of step with its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that term, but Radio 3 has "dumped", becoming more and more Classic FM".
The first was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which were launched last year, are another version of the Brit Awards.
Bingham said, "So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, whereas you're just copying what's already on the market".
The BBC's director general denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was clearly ahead of its commercial rivals in both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to go and learn anything about classical music from anywhere else.
And that's the commitment to live music, and making music is nothing compared to that.
He also said that he thought Radio 3's efforts to discover new music and promote the work were very important.
Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, argued earlier this year that radio should work harder than in the past to reach a wider audience, because Britons are less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only component to be held up at the Culture, Media and Sport selection committee meeting as the BBC stepped on the tail of its commercial rivals.
MP Tory Damien Collins also lashed out at O Voice - the BBC's music talent competition, which has been subsidised by Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million.
Can't you see why the show is making so much noise, because it's not original and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which featured Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made "in a style typical of the BBC".
He said he wished the agency had "a hit out of his own blood" before he ever did any more entertainment.
However, he also disagreed with the idea of preventing the development of more O Voice programs in the future or of spending the money spent on licensing fees on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason why August saw the lowest growth in internet sales in history?
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by seven percent.
Last month , the lowest growth since 2000 , when records began to break .
Three years ago , when mobile devices were introduced to shopping , there was an explosion in online sales .
Experts say Black Friday in November could be the reason for the spending cuts
Online shopping has been booming for over a decade, turning Britain's most vibrant shopping streets into ghost towns.
After figures showing a mere seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say there are increasing signs of weakening.
Total spending in August was up just five percent from last year, the lowest growth since records began to break in 2000.
After figures showing a mere seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say online sales are showing signs of increasing weakness
Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian: "If you look at the growth rates of the previous years, and 2000 in particular, you actually see that everything is returning to normal over time".
He added that internet sales had increased dramatically three years ago, when consumers started using their mobile phones to buy products.
This meant that more people could shop while lying on the couch.
But now it's going horizontally, you can see the descent.
Black Friday, a concept borrowed from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts say consumers may be looking forward to the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
At last year's event, many companies' websites crashed when five times more consumers hacked into their websites to get cheap products than the year before.
Experts say Black Friday shoppers may have been restrained "for now", indicating that shoppers were fighting for discounts.
A study published by the British Retailers Association found that of every £5 spent shopping, £1 was spent on online purchases.
One third of certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, are now purchased in online stores.
More than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online rather than in luxury shopping malls.
Muslims salute those who lost their lives in the crane crash in Mecca after the conviction of the Bin Laden family
After the first funerals in Mecca, the bodies of 29 people who lost their lives were carried in the streets by Muslims
Saudi Arabia blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin for the wreck of the crane
The health ministry reported that 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who lost their lives in the fall of a crane at the Masjid-i-Haram.
The crowd, mostly white, closed the way for their first funeral at the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca to bid farewell to their final journey.
The agonized crowd passed the holy site where a crane had broken the roof of the mosque and toppled the pilgrims.
The bodies of the dead were brought in for burial after the Saudi Kingdom blamed the Binladin family, the owner of the construction holding, for the incident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died in a crane crash at the Masjid-i-Haram were carried along the way.
Among the dead was Kasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram came to the Sacred Mosque with his parents at the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi leaders announced that the pilgrimage will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
In his speech today, King Salman said Binladin Holding Group should not leave the crane arm open when it is out of service.
The Arabic version of the order, prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the only party to be blamed for the incident was the Binladin Group.
The English service of the news agency did not go into detail, but the company reported to the authorities that a travel ban had been imposed.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find the cause of the collapse of the courtyard of the Masjid-i-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are on the pilgrimage at the end of the month.
Binladin's group has not commented on the downed crane and its representatives have not been allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of not taking up-to-date safety measures and not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Masjid-i-Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, much of which is under the control of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been in close contact with Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is the name behind many of the construction projects.
Osama Bin Laden, the last leader of al-Qaeda, was a deviant son whose family had barred him from adoption.
The accident occurred just days before millions flocked to the pilgrimage site, which every adult Muslim is required to visit at least once in his or her life, amid heavy winds and rain.
Authorities reported that 158 people are still being treated in hospital.
Authorities have ordered compensation of 1 million rials (£174,000) to the families of the dead and those who survived with permanent disabilities.
The other wounded will get half that amount.
The B&Q boss says it's Eastern European craftsmen who are behind this trend, working cheaply.
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more craftsmen
The reason for this increase is the number of skilled Eastern European craftsmen
This has resulted in the opening of 200 new Screwfix stores targeting artisans
Kingfisher is also closing 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
By Rupert Steiner, city editor of the Daily Mail
It is said that the British began to hire skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do their homework instead of leaving their hammers and paintbrushes
If you're good with a hammer or skilled at painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the British are hiring more and more craftsmen to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of home improvement chain Kingfisher, said that behind this trend was a huge increase in the number of skilled Eastern European craftsmen offering services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores and plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores for artisans.
Ms. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store were made by women.
The staff is mostly male now.
The single women who have made more home improvements than in the past said that the need for housing is to meet the evolving demographic trends.
"Our stores are still predominantly men", said Ms. Laury.
We need to find more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about the products we buy are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, one of five women to lead the FTSE100, the index of Britain's leading firms, has restructured her senior team to include an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in this field with a full 50 percent female staff, including the CEO and CFO.
"It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here", said Ms. Laury.
It wasn't hard to find the right women to sit on our board.
After the group charged the cost of the closing stores, Kingfisher announced a decline in both sub-monthly profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Screwfix and B&Q owner Kingfisher will open 200 new stores.
It 's time for the Fed to decide on a rate hike .
The two-day meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and Thursday are being watched by the world, and a decision is expected to be made on whether to raise interest rates in ten years.
In a Reuters poll, just over half of the 80 economists said last week that the Fed would implement the decision, and now they think it will be suspended and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
This is historic, as it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
"For the first time, we will see a major central bank move from zero to normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is doing relatively well, and the process of economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and creating a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed can't ignore the global picture, which is less promising.
The markets have warned of a rise, but there are indications that they believe the situation will not allow such a rise.
The verdict will be announced Thursday at 8:00.
The perp of the Delta State University murder left an apology letter.
Authorities said Tuesday that Shannon Lamb left a note saying she was "saddened" by the first murder after shooting her girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning and before killing her roommate later that day, and that she wished "if I could get it back".
Mississippi Gautier police say Lamb, a geography and social studies instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
Monday and said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb said to the attendant on the phone that he should send the police.
Lamb, who said he "killed my wife last night", also noted that he had a "cute dog in the house that didn't hurt anyone" and was probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb didn't make any comment about the murder.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the lifeless body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn back the clock.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing this note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, then killed himself when the cops caught up with him.
University Dean William LaForge stated that he did not know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was obvious that Lamb had something on his mind".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss was also having an emotional relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that they had "no information or evidence" that it was a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for nearly seven years, describes him as "a good man".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but their friendship lasted.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her 19-year-old daughter were found and that she was "in a state of disrepair".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "definitely each other's best friends".
Linsday Knowless, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Parentiss's, stated that Prentiss was working from his home via the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
"He always liked to help others", Knowles said.
Police say Lamb called his family on Monday and said he wasn't going to jail.
That same night, when the police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself with a gun.
According to his resume posted on the university's website, Lamb earned his doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their old charm
The actor (left), seen with his son Redmond (right), has had a very stressful few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he sacrificed his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor, who is said to have struggled with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
Of course, all of this hurt him.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
The incident, which has left the defender in tears, will leave him out of action for at least six months, leaving Louis van Gaal hopeful that Shaw will be back on the field this season.
The foul was caused by a careless collision with Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute of the match, when 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the field.
He was intercepted on the scene for nine minutes and then had to be oxygenated before being transported to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a broken ankle and is in the hospital".
Maybe today or the next day, he'll be shipped off to Manchester for surgery.
It's a terrible situation - a young man who's transferred to Manchester at 18, has a tough time, then a great game, and then this.
He had an oxygen mask on his face when he was in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm no doctor, but if you have a double-breach, that's at least six months, and that means you can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal has suggested that the Italian official made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible two-legged fight.
Shaw's account tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how disappointed I am, my recovery is now beginning, I will return stronger".
Related: Luke Shaw is in shock after his injury in Manchester United's PSV defeat
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be the morale for the English defender's recovery.
PSV technical director Phillip Cocu said: "It's a very bad injury".
If an injury like this happens to any player, it's a sad thing.
Our players never intend to injure your opponent.
Moreno also suffered a broken leg while playing for Van Gaal's Mexico team against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Cocu finds this very difficult because he never intended to injure his opponent and he never got better after hearing that it was a bad fracture.
It was impossible to see that moment from my perspective.
All I could see was the ball going in the other direction, like Moreno had touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's play.
In an interview with SBS 6, Moreno said: "I know what it feels like, I know how hard it can be.
I feel really bad about it, and I'm really sorry.
He was taken to hospital after a fight with Chris Smalling at PSV's Andrés Guardado.
Of course David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
This is something every parent learns very quickly: when your child likes a book, you know it won't take you long to learn it almost by heart.
It seems that if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of holiday programming for childcare what his favourite children's book was, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, a 1971 environmental fairy tale by Dr. Seuss.
Cameron, who writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website that this was a difficult decision, continues: "I love reading to my children because this book is funny, moving, creative, and powerful, and it contains an image or message that we often skip".
Everything was going great until this paragraph where Cameron supposedly wrote something about the book, but in fact added new characters and details to inflate the content of the original fairy tale text, which was summarized in the 2012 film version of the book.
In Thneed-Ville, a walled city where all nature is gone, where even the air is metaphor, a boy named Ted wishes to see a real tree to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey, incorporating a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If that doesn't strike you as suspicious enough, the text Cameron handled is in some ways very similar to the short synopsis of the film The Lora at the Internet Film Archive, which begins, "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the weather is a commodity, a boy named Ted seeks to win the heart of his imaginary Audrey".
Given his claims to be a skilled parent, it is unlikely that Cameron is unaware of the book's central theme of how an unnamed teenage boy hears the local environment being destroyed by the greedy, tree-cutting, cry-shouting Once, despite the objections of the grumpy, moustached, and "tree-speaking" creature called the Lorax, who gave the book its name.
Probably such a weak PR job was assigned to a servant, who apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for the president said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's campaign office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but has not commented beyond that.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of England's removal, but he's still in perfect health.
It's a tough task to play Pakistan in the UAE, but after seeing the England team selected for the tour, I don't think a repeat of last year's 3-0 Test series defeat is on the cards.
Still, I'm not ruling out a placement win.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but they have players who are returning well on the batting line and a strong sense of collective play; they don't heal the wounds of 2012, they just provide some youthful optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali is developing as a game-turner and Adil Rashid represents an attacking option even if his quality is unknown at the Trial level.
Adam Lyth has left the England Test team and Alex Hales has been brought in.
The decision to fire Adam Lyth is a difficult one for me to analyze as head coach at Yorkshire.
The Seven Tests were against two good bats in tough conditions and the simple but unavoidable fact is that cricketers are judged by the results.
There was no question mark on Joe Root, for example, so it had to be announced because -- as I said before -- the players were their best choice.
After a few fifties, Lyth could see his career stretch, but he decided his own fate.
I hope he gets another chance if he works for Yorkshire more.
England coach Trevor Bayliss, despite not having his best performance, praised the player's attitude, which didn't surprise me; he's a team player after all.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes for a Test batsman to get a grade.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - took seven caps, while Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play in a rematch.
The only pain you might feel for Jonathan Trott is that England will be the first to go to the Caribbean - while Lyth's form is at its peak - but that wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a top-class hitter to me.
He's an X-Factor cricketer, and we saw that in Yorkshire when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge earlier this season.
At least he should be able to get the same opportunity as before, but that depends on the team structure in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen hitting the opening pitch with Cook to get the extra spin while holding four quick ones worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't see why a batsman can't shoot here, besides this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for his hometown of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it doesn't make much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests in his first drop before starting his debut in 2001.
He took the three hundred straight away and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup pitcher, and in my limited interviews with him, he surprised me as an impressive young man.
People might look at his raw stats -- 31 average at bat and 35 average at ball -- and think it's a disgrace, but there aren't a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the player selections have been made since he was young.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seem to have made a few clever additions to their own coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for Test matches could be a clever measure.
He's one of the most adorable characters in the game, and he's going to bring with him a wealth of experience, in all conditions and against all odds.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball leg of the round and he's giving both the energy and the game a ruthless streak.
I've always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether as a player or a coach, and he has a sense that can be guided like Mahela.
Sometimes in the locker room, new voices, even messages that have been said before, can be relayed, bringing a new element to the team.
Colly's Durham teammate Ben Stokes is being rested for one-day matches, Root has been given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
Though not everyone agrees, the plans aren't made by the coaches and the players.
And you have to remember that like the players, their work depends on the results.
Decisions like this are never easy.
If the economy stagnates by 2017, the Brexit camp may win.
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse by the day, and that's despite Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn being elected Labour leader or TUC's annoyance over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A friend of mine, a European diplomat, recently said that some member states are tired of the divisive, self-serving British agenda of concessions and de-escalation of treaty changes, which most of them do not want, in an EU that is completely engulfed in crises that they did not cause.
The TUC decided at their annual meeting in Brighton that they didn't want them if it was to harm social security.
In fact, we could call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of famous monuments, whether they are local notables or not, and then go back to their countries and say they have gathered allies for reform.
This is all about me.
As Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France", my European friend, who wants an outsider Britain in the EU tent, pointed out that the trend in some capitals is becoming more and more shortsighted and that the authorities have reached a point where they no longer care if we stay.
Germany's cautious and sensible Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, yet she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before things get worse, as in the case of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces re-election or a change of power in France in 2017.
That's a dying force.
Soon a right-wing nationalist government will come to power in Poland, and a left-wing government in Spain.
Selfie, for the British who should be using their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, it's unlikely that these countries will show any interest in it because they don't want it either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers might be planning to accelerate Brexit, like the Scottish National Party did, by making deliberate statements during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign that would not help the situation, my friend says.
"There would be no renegotiation" and "Britain has gained nothing from renegotiation".
Europeans know from their past experience how exploitative the oligarchic press barons of Fleet Street were, how anti-EU they were in Tony Benn's time, who inspired the 1975 referendum that ratified our entry in 1973 by a two-to-one margin.
This is how they remember Boris Johnson, the leading Euro-opponent who was a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s, calling himself "the EU banana".
All the nonsense aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included tax dodgers, illegal wiretapping aliens, and so-called foreign residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, often thought the same thing, but when a rabid gorilla was trapped in a cage, he realized that he needed to be distracted by feeding it bananas at lunch and then at tea time, so as not to be eaten.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposing Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, because Blair had waived the principle on the EU constitution that was abolished in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - and I told him he had no time to waste on me - seems in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's then-and-now mistake-in-the-80s strategy of boycotting Murdoch.
Although it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with not me but the media, especially Andrew Marr, who will leave the BBC chair on Sunday.
I'm kind of expressing Corbyn's official position in Europe as evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most people outside the hostile Ukip tendency and ardent supporters of Conservative Little Britain say yes.
After all, that's what "a Benn but not a Bennite" Hilary Benn said on radio and television this week, because she naively forced herself not to accept that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of his father's fight on television in the '70s for disloyalty to his colleagues in the labor cabinet, not getting much further, and losing his cabinet position.
Hilary's struggle was more appealing.
But "in Benn's words - fighting to stay "under all circumstances" was not the same as what McDonnell said or what JC said to the Lords MPs at a private meeting Monday night.
And given what touched me, whatever the details of the narrative Corbyn is trying to convey, the message remains relevant in the age of 24/7 TV, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, which is a bed of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to make a difficult case for Europe, which would have guaranteed Cameron Labour's support in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's conversions to the Bennite siege economy and anti-capitalist past of EU membership are no longer just a private debate among left-wing dissidents, where narcissism of small differences is a cornerstone of their doctrinal outrage.
As with his passage on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for secession - foreign diplomats will have to work to make sense of it for their masters in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital on concessions to Britain when they have their own skeptical voters?
As I was told at the opening of the British Impact Security Forum on Monday, the US is already deeply disappointed by the British's weak minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria despite the cost-cutting Conservative Party government in power.
Experts criticize the UK public health research on e-cigarettes
Researchers at a 12-person meeting of tobacco industry associates, sponsored by a government-funded agency, claimed that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in the UK Public Health (PHE) report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its "turning point" report last month, which it described as "a detailed examination of the evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the validity of the data, and some experts have pointed to the links between the tobacco industry and the tobacco industry.
Last month's headline in the Lancet medical journal targeted "extremely bad foundation" based on the main finding of PHE.
Two other researchers, writing in the BMJ, questioned whether the claims were "built on sand or rock".
"The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness", said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool.
They said they expect the public's claims that PHE "is about 95% less harmful than smoking, according to the best estimate available", to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
This is actually the result of a 12-person meeting that came together to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously reportedly received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
They also said that he approved a public health introduction document for BAT in a sustainability report.
They added that one in 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but this was not the previously reported funding from Philip Morris International cigarette company.
No information was given on how the panel members were selected, but they included some of the known giants of e-cigarettes, some of whom reported industry funding in the article.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person in charge of tobacco at PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research paper "effectively" admitted to lack of "concrete evidence about the harms of most products based on many criteria".
But none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that the claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a switch to smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had already been answered.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence indicates that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear mission: to educate the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially at a time when there is much confusion about the harmful effects of tobacco compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
We are fulfilling our national responsibility by clearly presenting the evidence that e-cigarettes are not harmless, but only a small part of the harm caused by smoking.
The former Channel 4 boss said the BBC should drop EastEnders.
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop airing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and has suggested that advertising rivals could "give their right arm out" for hit programmes such as the Albert Square series.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make programmes of a kind not made by other British publishers.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes on channels like BBC4 that were likely to be watched by a smaller group of viewers, versus the highest-rated programmes of their rivals at valuable intervals.
After the BBC's Director General Tony Hall said the organisation wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said that it had been unsuccessfully attempted for six years in his time at Channel 4 to establish a link with the BBC.
Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee during a question on the BBC's future, "I am opposed to the idea of the BBC ordering and broadcasting programmes that can be shown by competitors without explicit subsidy".
If you continue to implement a license fee, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, then your output should at least be down to programs that no one else makes or orders.
They're broadcasting The Voice primetime because they want to provide as much support as possible in the future.
The idea here is based on the idea that nobody else will publish it, which is ridiculous and blatantly absurd.
"I don't see why programs that can be funded without aid should be funded with a reduced rate of tax", Johnson said.
One is The Voice and the other is EastEnders, and it's actually done in-house.
To be honest, the other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how the public service announcements are.
I don't think it's going to bring down the BBC at all.
Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the passion of the people who work there and because these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes echo those of Tony Ball, a previous Sky administrator who used the MacTaggart course in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell its programmes such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes would go to BBC4 and that there would be no audience measurement here, but that they would be tax exempt and that they could discuss providing a floor for £4 billion in licence fee revenue to continue their showbiz piety missions, adding: "We are of course doing all these slick programmes that nobody is watching".
They put them in the void where no one ever sees them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the best benefit from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, 150 pounds a year is a lot of money, but I wonder if people who spend 150 pounds a year are doing it because they don't watch a lot of BBC.
David Elstein, the former Sky and Channel 5 executive who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that some of the BBC's output is now officially classified as education - that's 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio - and public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be at the forefront of this and this should be replaced by "informing, enlightening and educating".
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about proms that only a handful of people show on TV and partner with advertisers to ensure they are all viewable online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
This video shows how the wolves change direction when they're hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
The tiny wolf-threaders are able to change direction when hit by sound vibrations at a rate that humans cannot hear.
The vibrations are activated by turning on genetically modified motor neurons to carry membrane channels that respond to the ultrasound.
Related: Researchers read and record brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms proved the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, whereby ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an interventional procedure that sends electrical vibrations into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Wireworms don't usually respond to sound, but Chalasani found that they do when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he found amplify the ultrasound waves, allowing the worms to pass through.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect structures in the membranes of some worm cells called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report in Nature Communications, sound waves open these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are attached.
To create ultrasound-controlled worms, Chalasani genetically engineered worms to allow some of their motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves were amplified by micro-bubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they activated the altered motor neurons.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent through an optical fiber to a desired point in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass unobstructed through tissue and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, human neurons targeted in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments can be made temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signal", Chalasani said.
He added that other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment-- right on your doorstep!
The ads condemn the UK's arms trade
Watch the video of the Amnesty International anti-gun exhibition.
The dreaded killer drones!
The pranga that shattered your ankle!
Particle bombs!
And the electric shock punches that cause intense pain but leave no trace!
The thin sound and cartoon footage produced for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the Excel Centre in the Port of London leaves no doubt that the world's largest arms fair is a sharp hoax.

But a different campaign is going on with posters at bus stops and subways, and it requires a double look.
One uses the font and branding of the London Underground to convert the DLR line into a tank, and says, "Important announcement, will you be travelling in the DLR between 15 and 18 September?"
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will attack the DLR... and customers are being asked to help stop this arms fair.
300 posters from artists exhibiting at the Museum of Cruel Design in Bansky's Dismalland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute it using "Strike Packages to Advertising Space", which was £6 and claimed to "provide access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London was not happy with the "vandalism" of this poster.
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Design and faculty member at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more and more inquisitive and looking for ways to bring political work to the masses outside of galleries.
Many artists are moving with activists in protest movements, and they're starting to realize that their art needs to come out into the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster is being displayed in front of subway travelers.
The Amnesty International video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours, was created by the free-working VCCP advertising agency and the graphic designer and sound artist also produced it for free.
Matt Lever, creative director of VCCP, was very surprised by the silence about gun show ads -- with the Excel calendar blank -- and thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic, subtle corporate ad, but "they embellished it with bright colors and animation, it was more eye-catching".
"They were very helpful in raising concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the British government to act and stop the illegal sale of torture equipment on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the gun show comes from inside the ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab showed the US military ordering "shoulder-launched AT4CS RS".
It contains "a warhead of unique shape and a powerful blow through the armor to the target".
Whatever he's doing, it's not going to be nice.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories.
It's been 11 years since I moved into the dorm as an uninterested 19-year-old, and I still believe in the merits and moral relativity, but now I remember the phony smiles of those I bothered - and their countless long complaints about others.
Much of what I've learned can be summarized in the eight golden rules.
Moving in can range from frustrating to completely terrifying.
The seductiveness of the gossip: where people come from, whether they lost the year, where they insisted on Corbyn and why you "brightly neither love nor hate Marmite because really, gentlemen, he's just a yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be in my room".
Just take a breath.
And let the others have one -- ask questions and relate.
It will guide that conversation and help you distinguish who you like from who you don't, even if your eyelashes are lit and they're holding a fire extinguisher.
Give the people some space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking receptions, movie night venues and social gatherings, but they're also places where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Related: Don 't even think about starting college with a relationship
Interns get a lot of bad treatment at the university.
Your room may be a retreat, but many hallways foster a culture of inter-room socializing, open to socializing and lifelong friendships.
That could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
Nothing in our culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away for a while so I can make up for the energy I spent communicating with you".
You might notice that a friend is tired of socializing, and maybe instead of knocking, try texting.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A friend at the dorm had a policy that if the door wasn't locked, you were invited in.
He's seen a lot.
Don't make friends by cooking.
Since you started college at the height of the food-competition craze, it's been less weird and less 1950s to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies, "Welcome to our neighborhood, I've cooked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions".
Giving people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk and maybe associate your face with a sweet surprise.
It's obviously about you being a great cook.
A lump of dough, sugar and oil, not well mixed, will cause people to pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
It's stealing to tickle someone's chicken, but stealing to get a few drops of milk for your tea?
Double check the milk owner.
Even if he's swimming in it, he'll probably tell you to take care of yourself.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal your stuff, and I understand you - but try to deal with it more mature than my roommate, who has put liquid soap on to punish the milk thief.
He's in prison now.
Don't make noise that prevents people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just being a decent person, but because you're the ones in the glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her next-door neighbor to beat the drums down a bit because it's 3:00 in the morning and she has a morning test.
The answer was to raise his voice even more.
When they finally closed at 5 a.m., she kindly let them sleep for two hours before she went to her three-hour test, putting on her own music and locking the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved into the same hallway as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird to misunderstand a hallway buddy and think he's your future spouse, and hang out, and leave, and have to see him every day and watch your co-workers get captured?
Of course it's heartfelt, but if your hot-ass corridor neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least talk to the little one and advise common sense.
When you're in a moment of joy and you notice someone leaving their keys inside without locking the door, know that the line between a joke and bullying someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to come back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in safety by hiding your stuff - but never dirty someone's room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer in a glass of water, but don't stick your things more than twice to the ceiling.

The oil companies are officially bankrupt.
Since 2014, when oil prices began to fall, the most deepwater oil exploration projects have been suspended, while investment of about $400 billion has been delayed until the end of last year.
According to research by consultancy Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have caused a $380 billion oil and gas exploration/production project to be suspended, while millions of barrels of production have been delayed across a vast geographic area, from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
The report, which shows oil prices falling to their lowest level in 12 years, from $115 in the summer of 2014 to a loss of 70 percent in 1.5 years, is the biggest reason for the cost cuts, the statement said.
400 BILLION dollars is missing
Crude oil prices are surprisingly low every day, and recently hit a 12-year low below $30.
"Will gasoline fall to $15?" A study published by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, in the days when the debate is raging over whether gasoline is cheaper than water, reveals how the industry is affected by falling prices.
Wood Mackenzie, who recently released a report in July that revealed that falling oil prices had caused the suspension of 46 major energy investments worth $200 billion, reveals where that figure is headed by the end of 2015.
According to the report, 22 major projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015, while a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since 2014, when the oil slump began.
And these projects are worth about 400 billion dollars.
2.9 million times a day
The study highlighted that the impact of low oil prices on company plans was "harmless", and noted that the most affected projects were deep-sea development projects.
The suspended projects amount to 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent in reserves, thus delaying the production of 2.9 million barrels of oil per day until 2025.
According to the study, the final investment decision of most of the projects in question was postponed to 2017 and beyond, while the first production targets were recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects postponed, the report highlighted a potential investment of $170 billion over the next five years, "most of which is deep-sea projects".
That's because the upfront cost is so high.
"Oil-intensive projects in the Gulf of Mexico, mainly in Nigeria, Angola, and the United States, account for 70 percent of deep-sea spending", it says.
According to the study, the countries with the most delayed oil project inventories are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the deferred liquid (oil) reserves.
The countries with the largest amount of deferred gas reserves are Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which together account for 85 percent.
While much of the natural gas waiting to be released here is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
The companies most at risk are oil giants with successive commitments in the deep sea, Canadian oil sands and the Caspian region, while companies are trying to adapt to a "longer lower" oil price scenario.
The eyes in Iran
Not so long ago, about four years ago, there was this picture: The United States and Europe had imposed an embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, oil was priced at about $110 a barrel, and there was discussion about how to cut Iranian oil exports without causing a sudden jump in prices.
And this week, we're back to a completely different scenario.
Oil prices have fallen below $30 for the first time since 2004, largely due to the explosion in U.S. production and the lifting of the embargo on Iran.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, it will flow more oil into the already highly saturated oil market.
And that could cause prices to fall below the levels that are surprising us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to take market share from Iran, will pump more oil and there could be a price war between Iran and South Arabia.
As soon as sanctions are lifted, Iran's main target is its old partners in Asia's fast-growing oil market, India, and Europe.
Iranian officials have previously said they aim to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day at first and then release as many as that amount on the market.
According to Reuters' map data, 22 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) are waiting off Iranian shores, with at least 13 of them fully or heavily loaded.
Iran is the fourth largest country in the world with proven oil reserves.
Thanks to the sanctions exemptions, Iran still exports about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's daily oil exports were up to 3 million barrels per day.
Asked if oil would fall below $20, securities researcher Aysun Göksu responds: "China-centric global growth concerns are driving downward pressure on commodity prices, while deepening losses in oil prices".
In China, the world's largest oil importer, we're seeing losses of up to 20 percent since Christmas, with concerns that demand will decline, in parallel with the economic slowdown.
Additionally, due to the global appreciation of the dollar and the global supply oversupply problem, we may see oil prices fall below $30 in the coming days.
Unless we see a sustained price rise above the $32-33 levels, the upward movement in oil could remain limited and downward pressure could increase.
At this point, closures below the critical $30 level could be said to play a key role in keeping the declines going.
In such a situation, it should not be surprising to see loosening at the bottom, which lasts until the 23.30-25.60 support zone.

I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I took important positions there.
Meanwhile, I've been counseling Cotton for the past two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and in the Coton brand.
I realized that you had everything you needed to be a chain store in the age of the earth.
And I'm here to make that happen.
Can you do it in a short time?
- I'm sure you are.
Although it's a young brand, it's already sold in 50 countries.
We put out 50 collections a year, 15 separate chapters.
So it's got everything a chain store needs.
We can cater to the needs of consumers in different geographies from Dubai to Moscow.
Now, we're opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Is it necessary to open a shop in Paris?
- I know.
It's not because Europe's economy is great.
But you open some stores for the image.
You'll have a shop in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you'll make money in the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both of which are necessary for a brand to play globally.
So let's talk about the trends.
- We're in for a very romantic, classy season.
Flying shifons, soft shades, purple, white, red.
They say...
We are going through very difficult and cruel times, and the fashion world is always trying to bring a touch of happiness to life by bringing stylish, soulful designs to the podium during these difficult times.
That's what we do.
So, the new season is the "breakfast age" again.
Let's go back to your days at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about her amazing physique, she's so positive, she's such a good girl!
He'd sit by me while I worked, and he'd feed me apples and stuff, and he'd say, "Honey, are you hungry?"
It was so sweet.
You know what I'm talking about, I did some research, and you interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
How beautiful was Karolina, huh?
But Adriana Lima impressed me with her beauty.
- Oh, yeah, that sound!
That speech, that tone...
You're gonna get a little nervous, and you're gonna say, "Sit down, look good, and do nothing else".
It's a little bit of a nervous breakdown.
Right, there's shocks like that.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified of her nonsense.
- Most of them are now.
The new angels are not the same...
I remember Gisele's days.
Although, he was a tough guy to work with.
He'd come in the backstage, smoke like a chimney.
And not because he's a tiryaki.
Nobody can drink, he's the only one who can!
The money is to be a giant.
The Victoria's Secret fashion show, which aired two months ago, has the lowest ratings in its history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, the time of the legendary beautiful angels is over.
I'm sorry, who would do Gigi Hadid?
What's so great about it?
Kendall Jenner, for example, is like wood...
I'm not curved, I'm not anything.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's become the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but how beautiful his face was.
I want to exercise my right to object here.
I interviewed him last year, and he was so down.
- All that smoking, drinking, now it's ugly.
But he had such a pretty face in the '90s.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
She was at the end of her supermodel era.
It was Linda Evangelista, it was Naomi Campbell, it was Christy Turlington.
Christy was my next-door neighbor, and I saw her every morning without makeup.
Such beauty cannot be such grace.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
Not every campaign gets a vote.
People are tired.
There's no hunger for famous models and celebrities like there used to be.
People like them, they want to see their real faces in the campaign.
We'll go with that.
Because it's the trend.
Letter from 25 writers to Turkey
According to BBC Turkish, the writers, including the presidents of the International Writers' Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, said that threats and physical attacks targeting their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter also included two attacks on the Turkish newspaper Hürriyet, the Koza raid and the detention of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests of journalists.
The mother's right to work part-time is a matter of debate.
Turk-İş "We think that mothers are given half the right to work in order to bring back the Kingdom's labor".
"This could be a trout horse", TISK said, "We are concerned that this arrangement in favor of women will prevent women from working".
The new rights that were planned to be brought to the civil servants and female employees after childbirth or adoption, passed the commission with talks that lasted all day.
The most frequent topic of discussion in the commission discussions was "rented labor" in the regulation that allows children to work part-time for 6 months after birth or unpaid leave, and until the child reaches the age of primary school.
The CHP Izmir MP Musa Çam, who stated that it is true that the child should be made to work part-time until he goes to primary school, but said that they had some concerns, said, "If you bring the hiring labor regulation behind this, we will be against it until the end".
Enis Bagdadioğlu, who participated in the Commission's talks on behalf of Türk-İş, expressed similar concerns, saying, "We have doubts about how the place of the female employee will be filled in the part-time work".
Baghdadioglu said that if the hiring of workers is brought up again, there will be new problems that will overcome the work in the countryside, "We will therefore carefully monitor the developments related to the special employment offices".
TİSK Secretary General Bülent Pirler said that the law introduced part-time work for 5 years, adding, "There is no such long-term part-time work in other countries".
And look at it this way.
"Where there are 1 or 2 employees, we need to think about the consequences of this practice", he said.
TOBB Advisor Ahmet Shagar also said that if the application is implemented, there will be difficulties in finding workers.
Shagar said that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, "Regulations on special employment offices should be agreed between the worker and the employer".
We do not support
Feizoglu's explanation is: "We do not participate in this declaration, we cannot participate and support it".
Because there is not one sentence of criticism of the PKK.
You didn't say a single negative word to the PKK, the divisive terrorist organization, you didn't dust it down.
We don't take the heavy statements that are only and only directed at the state seriously and we don't find them sincere, considering who is making them.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If there is any illegal behavior by government representatives, public officials, security forces in this framework, we will follow it.
When we say to the dissidents, or to the dissidents, who are sympathetic, who are the romantic remnants of the interregnum, "Do not overthrow the state", they attack us as "Fascist, separatist".
When we say, "This government should follow the law, always uphold the law", they say, "You're divisive".
We are the bridge.
We are the people who are obliged to tell the truth at all times.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgin Sarılmışer, was born on 16 July 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of his parents, he settled in Ankara in 1966 with his mother Sebahat Çakır.
After Yunus Emre Primary School, Yenimahalle entered the Piano Department of Ankara State Conservatory, but left due to financial difficulties and worked at the PTT for a while, growing old.
In 1979, he accepted an offer to work at the Feyman Nightclub after performing at the nightclub where he went to party with his friends.
At the Feyman Nightclub, the group performed with the Lokomotiv orchestra with repertoires consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the fashionable interludes of the time.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982 he released his first longplay, "I Have a Complaint", from Atlas Plak.
Bergen, who could not stand the violence of her husband as her artistic career continued, ran away from her several times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was molested at the insistence of her husband.
Bergen, who lost one eye and burned much of his body in the attack, was taken to the stage after treatment by the composer of the song "Who knows?" that made Kibariye famous.
The artist, who performed in the Izmir Prylanta Pavyon, owned by Özşeker until 1985, together with his boss made a demo tape called "Kardeşiz Kader" and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who released his first professional longplay on the Istanbul music market, "İnsan Severse" under the musical direction of Burhan Bayar, gained fame with "Azilerin Kadını" in late 1986.
The album was well received and in April 1987 she was awarded a Gold Record and a Gold Cassette by the record company with the title "1986 Album Most Satanist Female Artist".
In the same year, Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron appeared in the film "Agies Woman" with the script and direction of Ülkü Erakalın.
Bergen, who has a huge fan base, survived a last-minute stabbing attack in Adana, where he was attending a concert.
The artist, who also left the stage at one time, released the albums "Oni da Yak Tanrım", "The Price of My Love" and "I Don't Want" under the direction of great masters Selami Shahin, Özer Shenaï and Gengiz Tekin.
Bergen, who was also officially divorced from her husband in April 1989, made her return to the stage in June 1989 with her last album while alive, Years Are Not Enough.
The artist, who began touring to promote the album, which was met with intense attention, was shot dead by his divorced wife in Adana Pozanti on the night of 14 August 1989.
He was buried in his hometown of Mersin.
Bergen has recorded 129 songs on 5 longplay albums and 11 cassettes, and a video film in his short life of 29 years.
The claims that the artist, who signed his own car with a different and powerful voice, became legendary were confirmed by the first day of the release of the posthumous album "Giden Mijn Jeugd".
Bergen's official studio albums released:
1982 - I Have a Complaint LP (reissued as MC in 1986)
1983 - Brotherhood of Destiny LP (reissued as MC in 1985 and 1990).

Nazim Hikmet was remembered on his 114th birthday
Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the Motherland Poet, was commemorated with the event "Iyi Ki Doğdun Nazım" on the 114th anniversary of his birth.
The event was organized by the Municipality of Konak in the Güzelyalı Culture Center, in the hall named after the poet.
The poems of the famous poet were actively listened to and sung by the theater and cinema actor Rustu Asialy.
The Three Anatolian Music Society also accompanied the Asian with their comments.
Nazim Hikmet has accompanied the event with many art lovers.
Among these names were Ali Seçkini Alıcı, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Yıldız and Zeynep Göknur Yıldız and Ziya Özsökmenler.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazım Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members, daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter of Vera Tulyakova, wife of Nazim Hikmet, actress Tarik Akan, gathered in Tarabya for the event.
She will read poems and drop carnations into the sea with the slogan "Living is as one and free as a tree / And as a forest to her sister".
The event, which was organized with the contributions of Sarıyer Municipality, will be accompanied by the songs of the Nazım Hikmet Choir.
Nazim Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was arrested several times for his political views and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poetry has been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received numerous awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
The Nilüfer Municipality of Bursa has made special studies for the 114th birthday of the world-famous poet Nazım Hikmet.
The municipality, which has been working on the documentary "Bursa's Nazım" that tells the story of Nazım's 11 years in Bursa Prison, also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in the history of Turkey.
Thus, with the cooperation of PTT, the first personal coin in the history of Turkey was issued in the name of Nazım Hikmet.
This special stamp, which costs 1.40 TL, and the first day's envelopes will be given to guests on Thursday, January 14 at the night of the Nazım Hikmet Culture House.
They'll be deported by bicycle.
But because no agreement has been reached between the two countries, the refugees, most of them Syrians, will have to turn the pedal back to Russia at minus 20 degrees.
In the summer, a group of refugees flew to Russia, crossing the north of the country from Murmansk to Norway, saying it was safer and cheaper.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow the crossing of the border on foot, the migrants crossed the border on bicycles.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
So the Norwegian police ordered the repair of bicycles abandoned at the border.
The crisis in the EU "3 billion euros to Turkey"
THE crisis over the €3 billion pledged to Turkey for refugees is ongoing.
European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticized the blocking of funds to be transferred to Turkey by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
Juncker stressed that the EU had to find the 3 billion euros, noting that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe was not good.
Juncker: "This money is not for Turkey, it's for Syrian refugees in Turkey".
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of the credibility of the EU, and therefore important", he said.
Juncker said he expected the money to be completed by 26 January, the date previously given.
Italy is among the countries that have attracted attention for their positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources believe that Rome's handling of the financial package is not a direct attack on Turkey and is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some EU countries.
There's been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU during and after the last EU summit on energy, banking and migration.
At yesterday's press conference, Juncker criticized Renzi's attitude and said: "Renzi should stop blaming the EU".
"It is wrong for Renzi, whom I love so much, to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity", he said.
Juncker insinuated that Renzi was playing the public.
1 billion of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey will be met from the EU budget.
The other 2 billion will come from the budgets of the member states.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
It was decided that the Romanian administration, which will not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, will transfer the 2.3 million Euro to the EU budget to be used for supporting Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is expected to be used in 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon
Father Abdullah Kurdi, speaking to the official Russian news agency Sputnik, reacted sharply and said, "I cried for this cartoon, if you want to be honest".
"I felt so bad", she said.
Father Kurdi, who expressed positive expectations for the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which has become a symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very sad about this cartoon.
Aylan is a two-year-old boy and he's dead.
Aylan, me and my family were supposed to be respected by Charlie Hebdo, but it was the other way around.
This magazine should respect dead people.
They've published disrespectful cartoons about the Prophet.
And they have ascribed to Allah (all) similar things.
It is a small thing to do to my son in the sight of Allah and His Messenger.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made the following appeal: "I call on the whole world and the humor magazine, everyone should respect all the children who died".
We shouldn't hurt their families, we shouldn't add pain to their pain.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt, Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was among those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, the three-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi, who was shot dead on the beach in the cartoon, has a claim that he may grow up to be one of the bullies in Germany.
Last year, the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by radical religious extremists who killed 12 people on the pretext of publishing cartoons of Muhammad, was again the focus of controversy because of its cartoon about Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicted pig-faced abusers chasing women and evoking immigrants, as in the early days of the Christmas celebrations in Cologne, Germany.
The cartoon, which has caused a lot of reactions on social media, is actually part of a four-square column.
The column reads "This is not France", and many readers criticize the growing hostility to refugees along with other lost French values.
The cartoon, on the other hand, has led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine praised Germany for accepting 800,000 refugees in a similar issue last year, while criticizing France for its reluctance to open its doors to migrants.
The cartoon said, "He was so close to his goal", and the billboard said, "Two kids for the price of one".
'Autopsy of Germans who died in Sultanat in Germany'
According to the news on the website of the weekly Der Spiegel, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office has decided to bring the bodies of the 10 people who lost their lives in the attack to Germany.
The funeral of the dead will be met at the airport by a German Air Force plane, arriving in the country today or tomorrow.
In Germany, experts from the Commission for Identification, which is part of the Federal Criminal Investigation Service (BKA), carry out forensic procedures, and go to the countries where the incident occurred, identifying and performing autopsies for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks under normal circumstances.
However, Der Spiegel reported that this time things would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Division appealed to Turkish authorities to have the identification and autopsy of the dead performed in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities did not accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Division sent four specialists to Istanbul after the attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated in hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has lost her life.
Meiksins Wood, a prominent political theorist and socialist historian, was especially remembered for his important work on the origins of capitalism.
The works of Meiksins Wood, a Latvian born in New York in 1942, published in Turkish are: Escape from the classroom -- The archaic culture of capitalism -- Capitalism versus democracy -- The Roots of Capitalism -- The Empire of Capital -- Return to Marx
A ban on swimming pools for male refugees
The German press reported that the municipality would lift the ban if social workers in the country were to report that the message of the ban was understood by the refugees.
Social worker Markus Schnapka, who told WDR that the municipality did not want to punish the innocent for the behavior of several people, said that they informed those living in the hostels in three languages about the values that are valued in Germany.
Schnapka said that the city would punish any attack and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of the harassment scandals in Cologne happening at the upcoming carnival parade.
The city announced that the carnival parade was canceled because there was no guarantee that there would be no harassment.
What are the benefits of steaming?
Steaming, a technique that doesn't kill the vitamins and minerals in nutrients, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steaming, one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East, has boosted metabolism and facilitated digestion.
This eliminates problems such as indigestion, and the bacteria and microbes in the food are completely killed.
The protein, cellulose, starch in the food are completely dissolved by this technique, making the food softer.
Low-pressure steam cooking is done in a pot with the help of steam pots or steam machines.
High-pressure cooking uses less water and less cooking time.
The best example of this is baking in a spit-pot.
To cook foods, especially those on the diet, such as vegetables, you must wash them thoroughly and then filter them until they are well filtered.
A deep pan is filled with one third of water and a steam filter is placed inside the pan.
The mouth of the pot is left half-closed.
This allows steam to easily escape from the furnace.
The water is boiled by first bringing the furnace to its highest level, then bringing the furnace to a lower level to obtain a constant temperature.
Vegetables and foods cooked in steam for about 10 to 15 minutes are checked with the help of a fork after being thoroughly cooked.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the oven and served on plates.
The steaming technique does not change the appearance, color, or smell of food, so it is healthy.
The food's distinctive flavor remains the same.
That way, the quality and taste of the food will not be affected.
In steaming, which is also one of the most economical cooking methods, nutrient loss is kept to a minimum.
Steamed vegetables offer a more lively and lively appearance and a satisfying feast to the eater.
This method is often preferred, especially in diet foods, because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "last" album by the alien
Knowing you're gonna die, making that last album without telling anyone, making your deathbed an artistic expression in the video you're shooting...
Things like this may seem too "blank" to us earthly mortals.
I say mortal Earthlings because I am one of those who believe in my heart that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to Earth from another part of the universe, and now he's back in his homeland, and that's all that's going on.
He came because he had an inspiration that should be given to all artists in the world, not just Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He completed his mission with dignity.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Probably fed on Warhol, Kubrick, who's from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "Is this something I'm alien for?" and he just walked in and said, "Space Oddity".
He didn't really get involved; he always went a few steps ahead.
Many people have found their lost ways because of him.
The musician and the listener...
Aside from his interest in the fine arts, his acting, it's unfair to say that his music was just music.
The characters that he creates, the references, the innovation, the taboo-breaking, the discography that goes from song to song, that is an artistic whole to me.
I can't remember him as the father of glam rock or the cousin of punk...
What about that avant-garde electronic movement, the jazz he's been hiding in his heart since he was a child?
David Bowie was a reminder of what the word meant until we were taught the word "icon" years ago.
He wasn't a man, he wasn't a woman; he wasn't "human".
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while on a mission.
That body died two days after the release of his 26th studio album, "Blackstar".
He tried to get us used to the fact that he was going to leave with Lazarus and we were listening to "Blackstar" before the album came out.
We were like, "He's old now, he's talking about death or something", he was all over the place.
One more game...
Apart from the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that backed the album's message and emotional load, which were released long before, but re-recorded for this album, "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", along with "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore", were the four songs we knew when the album was released.
I'd like to say that the rest of them, like "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away", and "Dollar Days", are great songs too.
All in all, it's built on a very strong musical structure, but it's also built on a very sincere, momentary feeling, like "Blackstar"...
Not death, not a "reckoning with the past" album...
Just a real "final" record.
"The End" is a record of a musical life, a masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey was targeted in the attack on Sultanahmet
In a program on German first channel ARD, the head of the German Federal Security Service, Holger Münch, made statements about the attack on Sultanahmet Square on Tuesday, in which 10 German citizens lost their lives.
Munich said the target of the attack was Turkey, not German citizens.
"400 people in my watch"
However, Munich said that the attack on Sultanahmet did not change the terror threat in Germany, "We are still under a threat that must be taken seriously".
Munich noted that the number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join ISIS was decreasing, and many people returned from war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people we don't need to keep under surveillance right now", said Münch, who said this was a major challenge for security forces.
Munich called for better coordination and closer communication between police agencies in Europe.
Turkish authorities said the bomber was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the identity of the attacker could not be determined.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who celebrated his 40th anniversary with a series of concerts, charmed his fans with his "Sezenli Yıllar" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The final leg of the concert series, the first part of which was held in July, took place at the Volkswagen Arena on 15-16 January.
At the concert, Aksu took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
Besides love songs that touch our personal lives, Aksu sang songs on social issues that are of close interest to our country and world.
Aksu, who said he would bid farewell to his stage career after performing the concerts he had promised, saddened his fans.
At the "Sezenli Yıllar" concert, Sezen Aksu came out with a different story in each piece to the fans who filled the Volkswagen Arena.
Each story, each show, each light and stage show took the audience to a different time.
The last part of the unforgettable concert was a video presentation of Istanbul paintings by Revolution Erbil.
Aksu also hosted his fans on stage for the first time, featuring pre-recorded videos.
In Ankara and Istanbul, the price of bread increased by 25 cents
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold at a price of 1 TL, with a 25 cent increase.
On the eve of the New Year, especially in December, the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock Faruk Çelik and the Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci had made statements in the form of "No time".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold yesterday for 1 TL.
About the 25 cents increase in bread, the President of the Turkish Bakers Federation, Halil Ibrahim Balcı, said: "No delay was made, the tariff decision of 2 years ago started to be implemented".
"It was a recipe decision made two years ago".
The Craftsmen's Association set that recipe two years ago.
It's a price that applies throughout Turkey.
So a new increase was requested, and the price increase was not.
But because of the competition, in some parts of Ankara, the handicraft was selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already selling for 1 dollar.
The merchants who rely on their counter, their bread, didn't lower the price. They have to apply 1 TL because of the competition.
There's no increase or increase.
They're charging the unused price.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of bread per kilogram will definitely not exceed 5 TL and we will complete the year at this price if we do not experience a great hardship".
In some parts of Istanbul, bread is sold for 1.25 TL.
Terrorism has bloodied Burkina Faso this time
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed in an attack on a luxury hotel known to be a favorite destination for foreigners and United Nations officials.
The North African wing of al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso came four days after ISIS carried out a terrorist attack in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country with a population of 250 million.
A Canadian and an Indonesian were killed in a daytime bomb and gun attack on a Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street lined with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops.
Indonesian authorities said the attackers were inspired by the massacre in Paris on November 13.
Frank Garner, a security correspondent for the British BBC, pointed out that this is part of a recent alarming trend in many cities around the world.
The United States has recently been devastated by terrorist attacks.
In early December, 14 people were killed in a gun attack by a couple of ISIS sympathizers in San Bernardino, California, USA.
The San Bernardino attack that shook the United States
After the live bomb attack in Sultanahmet, which killed 10 German tourists, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere recalled that terrorist attacks had taken place in many parts of the world, saying, "We have had two major attacks in Paris".
If we say that, then terror has won...
We used the phrase "no backsliding".
ISIS has stopped using WhatsApp.
A new report says the terrorist organization ISIL is using its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to a report from Defense One, the organization is using a new messaging app to communicate with each other.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and downloaded via an APK file.
The application allows the organization to encrypt messages and share media among themselves.
The flash attack by ISIS in Iraq
The functionality of the app remains "primitive" compared to popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
It's not known how strong the encryption is.
ISIS previously carried out all its communications via Telegram, which allowed messages to be sent over an encrypted connection.
But Telegram had revealed the channels that ISIS members were talking on.
Moreover, the US administration requires app developers to install backdoors in their apps.
So the organization is now starting to use its own solutions instead of relying on the encryption of WhatsApp and Telegram.
IAEA: Iran has nuclear deal
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran had fulfilled its obligations under the nuclear deal and the United States had officially lifted economic sanctions against Iran: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that Iran had fulfilled its obligations under the nuclear deal.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted his congratulations on the lifting of sanctions following the nuclear deal signed between six countries and Tehran.
The champion of the veterans, Fenerbahçe!
The 4 Grands Salon Tournament, where the legendary footballers of Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor compete against each other in the league format, ended with the final match played yesterday evening.
Fenerbahçe won the match 8-6 at the Sakarya Indoor Sports Hall.
Fenerbahçe, who started the match quickly, closed the first half with a 5-1 lead, especially with the effective play of Marco Aurelio.
Galatasaray, who had a great run in the first minutes of the second period, scored consecutive goals to make the score 5-5.
However, Fenerbahçe managed to overcome the shock, scoring two more goals and winning the match 8-6.
In Fenerbahçe, legends such as Elvir Baliç, Mehmet Aurelio, Ceyhun Eriş were taking shape, while in Galatasaray, legends such as Ayhan Akman, Umit Karan, Papen Mustafa, Hasan Shash were sweating.
How should the semester break be used?
We asked the student coach Murat Aydin how students should evaluate the semester break.
Semester holidays should not be thought of as just for students; relaxation, fun, time spent in front of the TV and computer.
The semester is a great opportunity to prepare for the new academic year and to review the past.
The so-called half-hour vacation is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills, and hobbies.
Make a half-yearly list of evaluations.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to implement it.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about what a productive semester should be for students preparing for the YGS-LYS, first and foremost.
Because the questions we get most often from our peers preparing for the YGS-LYS exam are, "How should we evaluate this period, should we solve a lot of questions or do we have missing items?"
To answer these questions and to have a productive semester, let's start with our article with tips for friends who are preparing for the exam first.
The preparation process should normally start in the ninth grade, but we are trying to complete it in the last year, which means we have to spend the last year more effectively, efficiently and accurately.
The senior student has to do the school paper along with the exam preparation.
The year in which the graduate student is re-examined is of critical importance even if the graduate student has taken and experienced the YGS-LYS at least once.
Because most graduate students and their families see the 'O' year as their last chance, and that creates even more stress.
Studying is something that the student does not enjoy, just because he feels compelled, and therefore usually always stops at the end, but for the students who do it regularly, who make it a habit, it becomes a task, and there is always a plan of what to do and when to do it.
Now we have the half-year break and we have to make the most of it.
To do that, we must have a plan in place to manage our time well.
Studying during the semester:
Each person should make a plan according to his own situation first.
The first period is what's been done, what's been missing, the day, the week, the 15-day period.
During this period, there should be both repetitions and questions.
At the same time, students who are not too short can solve an average of 1-2 test cases.
Fix your issues: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eradicate forgetfulness is through repetition.
Students who make too many mistakes, especially in past subjects, should give weight to their general re-work.
Identify your missing issues first and plan for them day by day, and make sure you address them.
This planning will help you both academically and psychologically.
And when you're putting them in your schedule, make sure that they're the ones you're making the most mistakes on.
Because you won't have a vacation that long in the future.
Do the math .
It's as important to solve the question as it is to repeat the subject.
Because we can only tell how much we understand what we're doing by the feedback we get through the questions we solve.
Remember to put a certain number of questions each day.
The number of questions you're going to solve will vary depending on what you're doing that day, and you might not be able to solve that many questions in a day when you're doing a lot of work, but we should still do a fair amount of problem-solving work to see how much we've learned about the topic of the day.
Solve the trials:
Another thing you'll do during the semester is to solve the test papers.
Although not all of the subjects are finished, at least you can do the lesson-by-lesson test solutions.
Let's say you've done a lot of the Turkish class, you can do the 40 questions of the Turkish class.
And make sure you do time study while you're doing it.
If you can solve the 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes at first, your next goal should be to solve them in a few minutes less, if possible.
Vacation and Hobby Plan:
Of course, a vacation is not just about studying; it is also about taking a few days off to relax and do your hobbies.
A vacation spent just studying will prevent you from discharging and relaxing.
So, you should make plans that include special times for yourself.
Reading, watching television, surfing the Internet may be part of your plan, but most importantly, how much time you will devote to it.
And I have a little advice for my friends who say I haven't been productive in the first period.
If you think my first term didn't go so well, I didn't work hard, and I'm too lacking, this semester is a great opportunity for you.
But first you have to decide and believe.
In the 2009-2010 season of the Turkish Super League, the most goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now, you answer your own question: is the game over and you're going to the locker room, or is the game still going on and you have a lot of minutes to score?
I guess nobody wants to hear a losing football coach or a classic comment made by his players, "Now we're gonna watch the next game".
All you have to do now is leave the past behind and look forward, not walk, but run.
To sum up what we've said:
1) Plan a half-year vacation first,
2) Repeat what you already know.
3) You've dealt with your shortcomings,
4) Solve the question and make the point,
5) Solve the test exams,
6) Read a book,
7) Set new goals for the new term
8) Take time for yourself, hobbies and things you enjoy.
9) Spend time with family and friends.
10) Spend time in social and cultural activities (movie, sports, theater, concerts, trips, picnics, etc.)
The caravan has come a long way
The founder of Kervan, one of the largest 'home' store chains in Turkey with 45 stores with an average of 1,000 square meters each, Şinasi Demirel and his son Hasan, added Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores in the country, to the Kervan.
With the recent completion of the commercial registration process, Kervan also owns 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
He said that there is no Kervan store abroad, "Now we will continue with the large store Kervan, the smaller store with Home Sweet Home".
"The caravan will be opened abroad", he said.
In 2015, Home Sweet Home, with a turnover of 50 million lira, merged with Kervan, with a turnover of 90 million TL, resulting in a retail chain with a turnover of 140 million lira and production.
The total sales area of the company, which has 45 stores in 35 provinces, is 45,000 square meters.
25 of the stores are owned by the parent company.
I have about 500 people working in the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in 25 countries and a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and 320 employees.
Kadir Kalaycıoğlu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Home Sweet Home, which produces, exports and retails with partner Alev Pakten, said that they are very pleased to join the Kervan, "We are from Mardin and entered this sector in 1998".
We've been building a brand with the support of the Shinnasi gentlemen from the beginning.
Mr. Shinasi is the TRT of this sector.
We learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step into the retail business when he gave us his own White Center.
I was already working with Caravan as a strategic partner, not as a competitor.
"Now, with this merger, a very serious synergy will emerge", he said.
Kalaycıoğlu said that at present, Home Sweet Home has 17 stores abroad, with the bulk of them in the Middle East, and last month they started exporting to China.
"We also opened our first corner in Shanghai".
We've got a deal with a chain of 200 stores.
"From now on, we will develop the big retailers abroad as the Caravan, and the small retailers with Home Sweet Home", he said.
Poroshenko is selling his factory in Russia
In an interview with Liga.net, Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky said the plant was being put up for sale for $200 million.
Moskalevsky: "Yes, we have put the factory up for sale".
"As soon as it went on sale, all the real buyers disappeared", he said, not the buyer.
As for the price of the firm's factory in Russia's Lipetsk, Moskalevsky said, "We've set it at about $200 million".
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and candy a year, is one of the world's largest producers and is owned by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
The star holding company was Pladis overseas
Yıldız Holding has acquired and merged global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors under the name "Pladis".
The merger of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ülker has created a new $5.2 billion food giant with 26,000 employees.
Speaking at the meeting on the merger of global companies within Yıldız Holding, Yıldız Holding Board of Directors Chairman Murat Ülker said, "Being a global company was our goal from the beginning".
Murat Ülker broadcasted the sale of 335 million liras live from Periscope
It was founded 72 years ago, and now it's going to be a global brand, a global company, in the world of biscuit and chocolate candy, under the name Yıldız Holding.
In that time, we've gone from biscuit to chocolate to candy to retail to packaging to real estate to personal care and a variety of industries.
We have 77 factories in 14 countries, 300 brands and thousands of outlets.
He said that the entire Yıldız Holding is "a family of more than 50,000 people", and said, "Now that we have the opportunity in our family, we want to go back and focus on biscuit and chocolate candy, which is our main business, and become global in this field; we are reorganizing for this".
The life story of Ülker's father, Sabri Bey
We're reassessing our corporate structure, reorganizing ourselves.
We divided the world into zones.
And we've allocated these areas to our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammed and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü, responsible for the Turkish Republics of Middle East, South Africa and Turkey.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of the UK, continental Europe and Africa.
Ali Ulker, the quality and innovation guru, will take on global responsibility in his field, while Cem Karakaş will help me run the business.
China, Russia, partly Southeast Asia will be the new areas we're going to build and develop.
Murat Ülker sold shares in SAF GYO
"We promise happiness to the whole world with every bite", said Murat Ülker, "The name of our global company we set up to achieve this is Pladis".
"If you ask me where you invented the term "Pladis", it doesn't really have a special meaning", he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese have a Subaru, Iran has a Pervin.
We were inspired by the name of the Pleiades constellation, which in Arabic means Surya, which in Latin means Earth, and is made up of seven stars.
So we translated Ulker globally.
Ali Ülker, Vice Chairman of Yıldız Holding Board of Directors, stressed that by cooperating with laboratories in different countries, "we have begun to create synergies in innovation" and added:
We have very valuable R&amp;D teams, and by bringing these teams together, we've achieved some synergies so far in the work on an R&amp;D platform.
We have 27 R&amp;D centers under Pladis.
The biggest of these are in Turkey and England.
We have over 300 R&amp;D specialists working here.
And the synergy studies are already starting to pay off.
The drage (Nibbles) of Digestives, which is produced in Ulker and will start exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri at the chocolate factory of Ulker.
Another example of synergy: the different brands, but the same products, the Ulkers Krispi Turtles.
We adapted a cracker technology developed in England, Jacob's Crinklys, to Turkey, and soon brought a nice taste to our country under the name of Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı.
Laviva, who we all know very well, met with consumers in the United States today.
The Call of Duty franchise has surpassed 250 million
The series, which has been embraced by Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games, will be remembered for years to come.
The newly announced sales figures in particular are a testament to how legendary we should find it.
Activision, which holds the licensing rights to the series, showed 250 million copies in its exclusive share sales by the end of the year.
And the company, which shared the sales figures for the entire series at the start of last year, has managed to sell 75 million Call of Duty games since then.
And we're not wrong to say that a large portion of that number is certainly Black Ops 3.
Kemal Kilichdaroğlu was elected once again as the President
Kemal Kiliçdaroğlu was re-elected as the general president.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who received the support of 990 of the 238 delegates who voted, became the re-elected president.
248 of the votes cast were declared invalid.
After the announcement of the result, the party members held a demonstration of joy.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The council has completed its work, which will meet at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
Kılıçdaroğlu said in a briefing:
We'd like to see games played here, Turkish songs sung.
But it's not clear where we're coming from.
There is a reality of an unmanaged Turkey.
The atmosphere is overshadowing all of this.
The reason for the gloomy picture is the people who run the country.
As CHP, we are against terrorism, no matter where it comes from, no matter how it comes.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is fought with reason, with knowledge, with discernment.
Of course we fight, we don't want anyone to bleed from the nose.
How are the photos in Syria different from the photos in Lebanon, from the photos in the Southeast?
They made serious mistakes while sitting at the table.
The blood, the tears, the deaths, all are the responsibility of power.
In 2002 they surrendered the country with zero terror, today we have a Turkey that is returning to a lake of blood.
Who's responsible for this?
Is that Shahmuz, the taxi driver in Diyarbakir?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will attend meetings, exchange ideas, and be sincere about changing the strike laws.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal opinions.
I say, "Let's change the spirit of the punching bag".
The intellectuals of this country have been raided, detained in the middle of the morning because they have expressed their views.
There are some things we disagree with, but people should be free to express their opinions.
This dictator's scum says, "Eat the bread of the state and be an enemy to the state".
I want to ask him, why did those who ate the bread of the state and took advantage of all the facilities of the state, when they robbed the state, not think?
CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country.
We're all going to prepare for the fourth great revolution.
At any cost, we will bring liberal democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can detain us, whatever they do, no matter how heavy the price, CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I call you out, son of David.
Don't hide behind the law of the coup, the man who hides has not gotten rid of the mindset of the coup.
You gave the man who gave you the autograph a Distinguished Service Medal.
What blow are you talking about?
Totally dedicated to deceiving the public.
Party officials listed the other three revolutions as follows: the first major revolution ended the rule and established the Republic; the second major revolution, the transition from a one-party period to a multi-party period during the Innu period; the third revolution, the transition to social democracy with Bülent Ecevit.
The president has qualifications, duties.
Article 103 is the president's oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a person goes out and makes a promise, he keeps it till his death.
Because honor and honor are not in dispute with us.
The man with the dictator's badge, what honor and honor mean to you.
What do you know about honor and honor, why did you take this oath?
What do you mean by honor and honor?
I want to know.
The concept of honor and honor is the crown of the pious man.
Their intention is not to abolish the right to strike, but to enforce the right to strike.
They want the presidential system that's not enough.
What kind of a president? A boss-led president system.
Why do you reject the parliamentary system of the Ottomans?
One man commands, and everyone does.
Is the parliamentarian in Turkey healthy?
No, it's not working.
If we bring in liberal democracy, the system works.
They call it a coup, but they've tightened the law of coups.
Mustafa Balbay, an Izmir MP, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, could not attend the race because he could not collect the signatures of the 128 delegates required for the candidacy.
Balbay, who collected 92 signatures, said, "I cannot be a candidate under the current circumstances".
He noted that while there were seats reserved for the members of the party's assembly (PM), central executive council (MYK) and honorary council, former CHP leader Deniz Baykal sat on the platforms with the party members.
Istanbul MP Gülay Yedekçi instead of sitting in the seat reserved for his deputies, came early and sat next to the seat reserved for General President Kılıçdaroğlu.
The meeting of the Yalova MP Muharrem İnce with Kılıçdaroğlu was one of the topics discussed in the council.
Ince explained that he had been offered the PM membership and that he had not accepted it.
However, sources from the general headquarters claimed that the request for the meeting came from Ince and that the PM membership was not offered.
Ince tweeted, "Anyone can learn about these general center sources, the content of the meeting from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan".
And he said, "How could I know that two people were talking?"
He was content to say "he's gone".
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded the press.
The party's assembly (PM) has marked the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Council" behind the scenes.
Kılıçdaroğlu went home after the meeting speech and started working for the PM list.
It was learned that while preparing the key list of 100 people, Kılıçdaroğlu said that he did not want to be included in the management, and that he would call 13 MYK members by phone, except for Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and Seyhan Erdoğdu, who once again ran for PM.
It is noted that Kılıçdaroğlu may point to a narrowed list of 100 key PM lists.
The 21-item final statement, which was unanimously adopted by the CHP Council, called for the removal of the comments on the European Charter on Local Government, which were raised by the DTK's autonomy debates, and increased power sharing on the ground.
The declaration also included goals such as "end the party state system", and "establish a transparent and accountable rule of law".
The meeting was attended by Deputy General President Selçuk Özdag from the AK Party, Idris Baluken from the HDP, Ruhsar Demirel from the MHP.
The AK Party's Osdag and the AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu's harsh criticism of President Erdogan.
"I saw that the criticism was missing the mark", said Özdag, "and I couldn't accept it".
The banners "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English were also displayed in the hall, with photographs of the arrested journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül.
The assembly started with the songs of Grup Yorum and Ahmet Kaya in the morning.
The message sent to the board by the wife of Tahir Elchi, the Diyarbakir Baro President who lost his life in the armed attack, was applauded.
Berkin Elvan's mother, Gülsüm, and his father, Sami Elvan, also joined the board.
The part where Kılıçdaroğlu said that they would "death" democracy at any price was the part that received the most applause.
CHP, which has held 52 assemblies, including 34 ordinary and 18 extraordinary, held its 53rd congress yesterday at Ankara Arena.
Attendance was high.
There were over 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000 seat hall.
But the crowd was not as enthusiastic as it should have been.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued as the couple greeted the hall.
There was no trace of the discipline seen in the AK Party congresses in the hall.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu was speaking, there was a lot of activity in the arena area.
It is clear that CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by talking to party officials and journalists.
One CHP official tried to explain that this was not a bad thing, saying, "It's better than party members sitting idly by, like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union".
There is another difference between the CHP and the AK Party or MHP.
At these parties, only the general presidents speak.
In the CHP, the congress becomes a platform for discussing party issues.
The number of party members who wanted to speak at the meeting yesterday was too high, and the head of the court, Murat Karayalch, had difficulty in arranging the time.
There was a distance between the expression "The country is going badly" and the comment "You will change the course with this painting coming out of the hall".
All the CHP members said, "Something should be done", but there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "What should be done".
The implication was that there would be no election in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu came to the podium, we journalists were waiting for his answer to the question "What should we do?"
Kılıçdaroğlu first answered the question "What is happening?"
He pointed out the issue of imprisoned journalists, what was done to academics because of the announcement, what happened in the Southeast, the dilemma of foreign policy.
He responded to the "Anatolian legends" about the CHP, such as "it is a non-religious party", "it supports coups", "it is the party of elitists".
As for the "what to do" phase, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to come up with a "strategy".
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome with a stronger democracy and more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, "We will work at all costs until we bring democracy".
"We will fight to the death for democracy", he said.
A final note: It should be remembered that the CHP has solved the "organization" problem since the 53rd Congress, and now it can convene the Congress without problems.
Meanwhile, the 900 journalists who were supposed to be following the meeting were all booked, but the press attendance in the room was not that high.
The Ankara representatives of media organizations were not as willing to follow the meeting as the AK Party representatives.
Self-government was asked to suspend
The indictment against 7 accused, who were arrested on 3 March by the Diyarbakir Republic Prosecutor's Office, was accepted by the 4th Heavy Penal Court.
The indictment stated that on the instructions and calls of the top leaders of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, "self-management" statements were made in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakır, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Mus, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Agri.
The indictment, which stated that calls for illegal actions were made from the youth and women's structures of the organization, noted an increase in bomb, long-range weapons and rocket attacks on security forces, public institutions and organizations, citizens' homes, workplaces and vehicles in Sur, Baglar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts of Diyarbakir.
The ISIL and the rebels clashed, our station was hit.
The clashes between the Islamic State and the Fatah Army in the villages of Duden, Kara Mezra Bygddin and Kara Bridge in Syria, opposite the village of Yavuzlu in Kilis, have intensified in recent days.
The sound of gunfire and air strikes during the clashes between ISIL and the opposition near the border is also heard by Turkey.
Smoke rising from areas where explosions occur frequently is visible to the naked eye by Turkey, while security forces have taken intensive measures with armored vehicles at the border line.
On the other hand, from the village of Bygddin, under the control of ISIL militants, the firing began at the Shahid Mehmet Border Station near the village of Yavuzlu, Kilis.
As part of the rules of engagement, soldiers responded to the area of harassment with shells and heavy weapons.
It is alleged that Russian warplanes attacked the village of Hameyin, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the airstrike were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
Lotto rich people got their checks
The Robinson couple, who live in a small house in Munford, Tennessee, worth $150,000, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million rather than a total of $528.8 million over a 29-year period.
The couple said, "There is no guarantee of our future".
John Robinson, a chain store owner, and his wife Lisa, who works as a dermatologist's assistant, said that although they are now millionaires, they will be at work on Monday.
The couple aims to use their earnings primarily to pay off their mortgage and help their loved ones.
It was announced that the jackpot was split into three.
iOS9: how to get the new iPhone operating system, Apple update released
You can go to Settings for the new operating system, tap "Generate" and select "Software Update".
When you're ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and install.
Some users experienced a problem after this installation and received an error message saying "Software failed to update".
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for the system to slow down or try iTunes and upgrade from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This could include deleting apps to make room - but Apple has prevented this from happening by downsizing the update, and recommending some apps to delete and using a special tool to reinstall them when the process is over.
It's worth making sure your phone is charged or near a charger to keep your battery running while you're updating.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't allow you to update, because the phone might stop halfway through the update.

FedEx's revenue mixed, financial outlook to fall in 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to declining demand for cargo services and rising costs for ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Pre-op transactions fell about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects earnings of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, based on research by FactSet.
The average increase of 4.9% effective on January 4 and high overcharges on heavy or large parcels on land transportation starting in November are likely to decline.
The company said that profits from cost cuts, higher revenue and e-commerce growth are still expected to be higher than the previous year.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "performed solidly despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The layoffs came a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, the same number as last year.
In the three months ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6% year-over-year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, down from $2.44 per share of the 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx suffered a setback in its international priority shipping last year, which led to a stagnation in revenue in its Express division.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted FedEx's location-based services results.
In the last quarter, land services revenue grew 29%, but operating income was essentially flat due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
High labor costs saw revenue decline in freight, while the express unit saw high revenue due to high base rates.
In pre-opening trading about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday with a drop of 11% for the year and 17% below the record high of June 11.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve politicians decided this week that it was time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, spending two days around a 27-foot Honduran mauno.
The two-story meeting room in one of the wings of the central bank will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Fed has two tasks from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged there is a third unwritten proxy: fiscal equilibrium.
And this third proxy could be the X factor in a surprisingly close decision on whether the US economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to begin cutting off the unprecedented stimulus support from near-zero short-term interest rates that has been in place since late 2008.
While most data shows the economy is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could already make cautious Fed officials wary of adding vulnerability by raising the benchmark federal funds rate - even by less than a quarter of one percent.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they're going to watch", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them ample reason to wait a little longer", he said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed is going to do, and that's causing fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists Bloomberg recently interviewed were expecting an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to remain on hold with the main indicator showing a growth potential of only about 30%.
This could signal a downturn in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, and policy makers don't mitigate the impact by promising that another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
"The increase was triggered by Fed policymakers' expectations that the rate would remain stable this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising if the Fed raised rates right now", he said.
If the Fed had decided to do so, "they would have had to take a long year to calm the financial markets so they wouldn't panic".
Other experts suggested that a rate hike could calm financial markets, due to the lifting of the fog over when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate this month by 0.25 points, which would be a small step toward the slow tightening of monetary conditions, which would strengthen the recovery of the United States.
Yellen said he expects this year's rate increase in the spring and early summer, despite the liberals' complaints about the need for a more economic process.
Although the rate of job creation declined in August, growth in the labor market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate last month dropped to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent, and is close to the level the Fed calculates for full employment.
The pay rises showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to watch below the central bank's annual target of 2%, Fed policymakers say the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices is a significant factor.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy "can cope with higher rates and needs it despite the tightness of the labor market".
But financial markets around the world began to shake after China's currency devalued at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to 16 percent below its May record level, driven by investors' fears that a slowing Chinese economy could drag down global growth.
The market has somehow bounced back, with the Dow now almost 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market volatility makes calculating when to raise the interest rate even more complicated.
"They may have been a little narrowed down at this meeting over the past few weeks with the uncertainty of what's happening in the financial markets in the Chinese economy and the lack of news about economic weakness", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research associate at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he estimates they'll have to wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and they have almost no data to rely on to predict the future of developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's top priorities, so technically it shouldn't be a factor in the black-up process.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The only hint from President Ben S. Bernanke up to that point was that in 2013 the Fed could "decrease" the monetary expansion triggered by global market shocks.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only follow developments elsewhere but also consult other central bank executives and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, global head of strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc., said decision-making is "more of a skill than a science".
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has in the past overreacted to financial market movements that do not appear to be tied to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee and pushing for a rate increase, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth", Lacker said, "the financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut the index rate by 0.75 points over three meetings".
A year later, the Fed officials took back those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee, said, "The Fed should only prioritize fiscal balance concerns during major crises, as it did during the 2008 market meltdown".
He said the last one didn't come close to that.
You don't really want to be afraid of going up in a rate because the markets are so angry, said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The central bank law still has dual powers and does not mention financial equilibrium, and I don't think they should make any move in that direction until that changes.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown
The market/depot opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Cities.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai Costco, is a wholesale Thai marketplace.
Yeah, that's Chinatown, not Taiwan.
The market/depot is a one-stop shop; it sells a wide range of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive part if you want to buy engine oil.
The store is huge and it could take an hour to walk through all the hallways.
If you get hungry from all this shopping, grab a bite from the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The grocery store is next to the (good, calculated) boxes, and there are various take-out options.
What's in stock: you want something from Thailand?
Probably at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are mass-marketed.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits, and more.
The meat shelf is very extensive, and so is the fish - the workers behind the counter clean the fish and make the fillet, and even fry it if you want.
A large part of the store has a large freezer section where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galangal, whole duck, fish, veal blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food, and more.
Who's shopping: restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
There are shopping carts and forklifts in the wide corridors.
Fresh monthong durian just off the exit stand.
Where: The store is in the industrial section of Los Angeles, between Chinatown and Downtown, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The Brazilian Pediatric Society of Rio Grande encourages healthy eating during breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has used a shocking method of using pictures of a baby with unhealthy food to test and teach women the importance of healthy nutrition during the breastfeeding process.
Human milk is made up of many different proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide all the nutrients needed for babies to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to their excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, recent research shows that the supplemental diet mothers need to take is not limited to calorie intake.
A new study led by Professor Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas found that healthy nutrition in pregnant women affected the genetic expression of their babies, protecting them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it has been found that malnutrition adversely affects a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate the ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's moves to Canberra to overthrow the Liberal leadership failed to bring a rating increase for Today.
After the fall of Tony Abbott's Malcolm Turnbull, the Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage in London, Rival Sunrise was caught between weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The issue of distance doesn't seem to make much difference to Australian viewers, with Today averaging 397,000 viewers in five capitals versus 339,000.
Today on Monday (317,000) recorded a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (283,000), but the number was still behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been closing in on Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318,000, compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, Sunrise's average is 349,000 against Today's 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that happens all morning.
The winds of change are affecting the people more than the parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the New Zealand seaside with his two children has reached an impressive average of 1.219 million.
Critics questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night was a resounding "yes".
Seven's X Factor maintained its strength with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
The two lovers mixed their luck with Australia's night pursuit.
The first half hour of the new knowledge contest, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30-18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
The first half hour of Monday Night Follow-Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and by the second half hour, that number had risen to 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australia's second night's ratings slump, it was Nine who thought the Hot Seat would prevail at 5:30.
The following Australia was a change made to the Million Dollar Minute, which did not match McGuire's show.

The last three think Single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he pick?
Did you find out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who would win the Singles.
The woman Sam Wood was going to pick at the end of his Singles program was kept a great secret.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell who the last rose is.
But if we check with Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski the day before the three people were tied, they may have given us a hint of who the winner is without realizing it.
Sam Wood has sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
All three women explained in lyrical language why Wood was so great, emphasizing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude, and why they wanted to be his partner.
But their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?" may hold information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood outside of themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I came home, I felt that [Sarah's] energy and Sam's energy were compatible, and I thought that throughout the program".
Markoski added: "Sarah is very practical, and it's fun to be around her".
I've seen them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable when they're together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a very good couple.
Mackay said that his house call appointments last week made him think Wood was "the one".
"When I saw it with my friends and family", she said, "I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I'm totally attached to it now".
When asked who Wood would choose without him, it was a mystery.
"I don't know if I can say that", he said.
"I like the other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equals".
The Bachelor airs on Ten Wednesdays at 7:30.
First broadcast: is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had a number of options for where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have taken a great interest in him since he moved to the U.S. And many other teams have approached him since last year's impressive open practice day.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems like a very wise decision.
Some coaches have put Hayne on the bench for his loss in Australian rugby league performance, as in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed him and gave Hayne another chance to play in a post-Reggie Bush injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true colors in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the rookies in front of the whole team, he gave them courage.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also got encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the loss and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne led the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter to score and drop the ball.
This wasn't what Hayne and his vast Australian fan base had dreamed for their first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen cursing as he left the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't think of a worse start to his NFL career.
He said, "It was just one of those things, you're gonna be sad about the next game, and that's it".
Hayne also recalled his 2007 Origin debut with a back pass that scored against Queensland.
Still, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a pose on Instagram after the game, holding an Australian flag with fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at gunpoint at a crossing in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was jailed, his oil company Yukos seized, and his pro-democracy efforts cut short.
Police shoot protesters in Nepal with plastic bullets, killing four
On Wednesday, an official said that four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed when police fired plastic bullets at a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution.
The incident occurred on Tuesday evening in the town of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that over 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station and some had thrown stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police fired pepper spray into the air before they fired the plastic bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets used to kill, but usually a less lethal alternative, resulted in such a high fatality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group argue that the areas created by the proposed new constitution will diminish their political influence.
The ethnic group Tharus, who want to establish their own state, are also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in the violent clashes that have been raging since August 10.
On this date, the four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions - a crucial but unrest-like step in preparing a new constitution for Nepal, which has been ruled by a centuries-old central government.
Work on a new constitution had been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands.
Lawmakers worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new text would be drafted by Sunday.
NHC says 60 percent hurricane potential south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday that a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecast center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical storm forming in the next two days.
Google launches a matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a matching campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that have helped thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google announced the donation on its blog, with a personal approach that was unexpected from itself.
Instead of an executive making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote her own personal experience.
"Our journey was one of hunger, thirst, cold and fear, as well as many dark bus and train journeys", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe grows, many families like my family need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it raised $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely due to the four-year-old Syrian civil war that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
They're also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery may help moderately obese diabetics
A new study suggests that it may take at least five years for obesity surgery to show benefit in moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
But it's too early to say whether moderately obese diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than patients who haven't had surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote the article on the new JAMA study and is an expert on obesity surgery, "death rates take a long time to show up".
Weight loss surgery, also known as bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on people with advanced obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
BMI, measured by the ratio of height to weight, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above is considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 or above is considered obese.
You can calculate BMI from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, the fully-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data from an experiment comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube surgery - that have been used to treat moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007.
By the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of surgeons had dropped from 31 to 24.5.
In contrast, those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment had BMI levels that remained stable at around 29.
Diabetes is completely resolved in 36% of surgical patients and partially resolved in 28% of surgical patients.
In the medically treated group, only 1% were completely and only 2% were partially resolved.
The authors also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "surgical intervention group".
The researchers also imaged the blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time, in the patients.
The researchers write that it's best to keep hemoglobin A1c below 7%.
Post-operatively, the average hemoglobin A1c has dropped from 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medically treated group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control", with improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over the five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, who led the study, and his colleagues.
The research team compared the findings with those of the two surgeries.
At year five, the bypass group had more weight gain (18.7 to 14.2 kg) than the tube-stomach surgery group, had higher decreases in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and similarly higher decreases in hemoglobin A1c (3.1% to 2.1) and had a higher likelihood of their diabetes fully recurring (46.9% to 16.7).
Although the study did not indicate a clear benefit for survival after surgery at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of the Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix said that he had valid data from a study in overweight patients in Sweden that surgical intervention prolonged life.
In this Swedish study, obese patients who had bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than those who had received more traditional treatment.
Although this new study did not reveal what the benefits were for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was relevant and reassuring for people with a BMI below 35.
And the most devastating part of the paper is here, because it says that in the low BMI group, this surgery is safe, there's no increase in the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking weight gain seriously as soon as the patient's BMI drops below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse it once you've collected these genetic changes in their bodies that make them associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama, who said that Europe could not host all refugees, added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK, spoke about the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which will conduct studies on ethical issues.
He argued that under the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should come first, rather than the interests of countries or continents.
He also stressed that, although appreciated, the responses of Western European countries to the refugee crisis were inadequate in this regard.
In his speech, he said, "It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe".
While he praised Germany and Austria for their efforts to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said they were only a temporary solution.
"It's great to care for a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions, how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education", he said.
We need to figure out how to reduce deaths in our country.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never been a solution to problems", he added.
Referring to the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to George Bush's actions after the September 11 attacks, and said that the US' violent response had started a chain of events that could not be controlled.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I conveyed my best wishes and stated that the solution to this problem would be non-violent.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and had unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Children swallowing hand antiseptics four times over the last four years
The Centers for Disease Control in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase in wet towel swallowing with high levels of alcohol in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of reported cases of hand antiseptic ingestion in children under 12 years of age has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are becoming more and more interested in these kinds of products", Lopez told CNN, "and unfortunately, some of them are in the immediate elimination phase".
He said some kids drank their hand sanitizer knowingly, while others did it to impress their friends or in a social media argument.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers taking antiseptics to get drunk for a low price.
Some adolescents have reported mixing the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder gut.
Young children may be attracted to the attractive smell of antiseptics.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think that's a bad thing".
The most attractive ones are the ones that smell.
There are hand antiseptics with a flavor of strawberries, grapes and oranges, which are highly attractive to children.
The alcohol content of hand sanitizers is 45 to 95 percent.
Only a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning, especially in young children.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the poison center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 television in Kansas City, "It's highly concentrated alcohol".
You don't leave a couple of whiskey glasses around, but people leave these hand sanitizers in the middle, and that's an easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who had swallowed only four packs of strawberry-smelling hand sanitizer at his school, was rushed to the hospital for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, which was twice the legal limit for alcohol in an adult.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce the words and couldn't walk when he got to the emergency room.
Rithey reported that because the alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her under observation overnight at a separate children's hospital despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that it was "very scary".
It could be fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use nonalcoholic products or to keep antiseptic wipes short of skin contact and to place them where children cannot reach them.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been found to be associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand antiseptic containing an unnamed toxic substance.
Health officials had suggested that the substance in question might not be ethyl alcohol as indicated in the list of ingredients, but lethal methyl alcohol.
In January, three fourth-graders from upstate New York plotted to poison their "evil-hearted" teachers by "placing antibacterial products around the classroom", according to police reports.
The teacher has banned the use of hand sanitizer in class because he is highly allergic.
The police described the plan as a "missed attempt" and recommended disciplinary action to the school administration.
You come to Samandera
Robin van Persie, who was watching the THY Europa League match between Fenerbahce and Lokomotiv Kuban, was reunited with Udoh, Vesely and Melih at the end of the match.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with Udoh, his fan, said, "I came to watch you".
You and your friends are gonna watch me practice.
"I'll wait for you in Samandar".
The ugly face is innocent
I'm being a humanist today.
I want no deaths.
But what is possible!
This world is cruel.
The fern whore.
There is death in destiny.
And the pain.
And the alien invasion, too.
And the lightning strike.
Sometimes a crashed space shuttle.
It could be a meteor.
I'm not saying there's no deaths.
I'm saying, let's just sign it.
Let's see how we react.
What a disaster!
Let our humanity grow.
Shame on the motherfucker.
But he ain't fucking shy!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray İnce in the Sur neighborhood of Shyrnak.
She was only three months old.
And his grandfather was with him.
They killed him, too.
On January 3rd, they killed Joseph the Oilman in Silopes.
I think he was running from the aliens.
They scanned him while he was looking for a safe place.
His wife was with him.
The day after that, they killed Melek Alpaydin at the breakfast table in Diyarbakır's Küçük Aktarlı Street.
A couple of days later, the aliens burned down the Sema Çingilyoglu Elementary School.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with guns.
The students ran away one by one.
On January 10, the bodies of three men who were killed in the attack of the brown dwarf in the Hazreti Hussein Mosque in the area of Shahid Harun Boy were left.
Two days ago, three children lost their lives in the Çınar district of Diyarbakır.
An unidentified object used a ton of explosives to kill these little ones.
There were other deaths and injuries.
Who's the culprit?
The shell, of course.
That's a nasty one.
No, it's not the dirty one.
The ugly duckling is innocent!
The killer's out there, waving his arms and smiling at us.
Others try to divert attention.
When the killer is in front of us, instead of pointing at him, he creates opportunities for him to escape.
He's hiding from the killer.
He's hiding it.
And then, after he's gone, he tells the next person he's not guilty.
The sides of the conflict we've been in for the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants to narrow the circle of fire around us and burn us.
And someone is trying to stop it, and more importantly, to put out the fire around us.
Someone's in the mood to tear it down, to plunder it.
Someone's after making, producing.
There are those who have seen us, our region, in every form of war.
The civil war.
War between the States.
The war of the sects.
The proxy war.
And they have their own immigrants.
They're dirty terrorist groups.
Bloody clowns.
Different names, different formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each of them.
He fights, and therefore he is obliged to respond to the evil of all.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your evil...
The traitors have no skirts, they take shelter in white cloths.
The PKK members, who are trapped in the neighborhood, find the solution in getting between the white flags and the citizen.
Security forces are implementing GBT to prevent leaks.
The activist power of the organization in the districts, which has suffered a major blow in the countryside and beyond the border with the peace and democracy operations that began on July 23, is also being broken.
According to sources in the area, the weapons and ammunition depot of the organization that suffered a major blow in Silopi was seized and rendered ineffective.
Some civilians fleeing attacks by the PKK are fleeing the conflict with white flags in their hands, under police and military control.
Trapped in the streets, terrorists began to flee with white flags, mingling with the civilian population.
Security forces are conducting General Information Gathering (GBT) interrogations of suspects.
In Silopi, a PKK terrorist was seen with a white flag, but when he realized that he would be caught during the GBT interrogation, he tried to escape and was neutralized.
Commandos will lead the charge.
In the area, the army and police have dealt a major blow to the terrorist organization in Djibril.
It is reported that the Jaffa neighborhood, where the militants are nesting, has been largely cleared.
Joint teams of police and gendarmerie special operations units completed their mission and replaced the commandos.
The commandos in the Jaffa neighborhood are taking precautions to prevent the terrorists from infiltrating again.
In other districts, security will be left to the commandos in areas where the joint teams are clearing the terrorists.
Police and soldiers 1 ton of baklava
The Municipality of Kilis sent 1 ton of baklava to the special forces police and soldiers who were on duty in difficult conditions in Cizre, Sur and Silopi.
The mayor of Kara said that he condemned terrorism and said, "May the Lord give strength and strength to our security forces who are defending their country and nation in difficult conditions".
"We pray for mercy from Allah for our martyrs, and for the speedy recovery of our soldiers".
The Chinnars told us about the night of terror
The Chinar people reacted greatly to the attack.
Most of the houses surrounding the blasted housing estates were rendered uninhabitable.
A neighborhood resident, Emin Altunç, said, "My son was injured, but we couldn't leave the house because of the gunfire.
We were able to take my son to the hospital after an hour".
Sabiha Özcan, who said that his wife was injured, said: "My wife was injured in the explosion while she was sleeping in the room.
He came crawling to the door".
It was covered in blood.
"I curse what happened", he said.
14 people died on the ski trail
A bus carrying skiers from Japan's ski areas in Karuizawa lost control and overturned.
The accident reportedly killed 14 people in the group and injured 27 others.

A woman named Viola Colombo, who lives in Venice, Italy, has won the right to convert 15 million lire she found in an old box from the online auction site e-Bay into euros.
Colombo, who bought the chest for a few euros in 2014, had been rejected by the Central Bank for trying to convert the old Italian lira into euros.

UNESCO requested to be allowed to enter the island without women
Japan has applied to place Okinojima Island on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2017, where only men are allowed to set foot because of the temples on it.
But the island's clergy are opposed to the decision, fearing a 'tourist future'.
Saudi Arabia has not given up on TUBITAK
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık said that a new agreement has been signed for the second batch sale of the Balistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALİSTİKA) to Saudi Arabia, developed by the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Institution (TÜBİTAK), and said, "The number of BALİSTİKA that will serve Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement that includes the development and installation of 8 additional systems".
Işık made the announcement regarding the BALISTICA, developed by the TUBITAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
The system allows the comparison of the ballistic examinations of the weapons, shells and cartridges seized in the incidents with the data in the central database, which eliminates the problems that ballistics experts encounter when examining the cartridges and cartridges.
Işık said that the data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information can be questioned by being stored together thanks to BALISTICA.
He pointed out that one of the most important features of BALISTICA is the ability to obtain and display more detailed and less error-prone three-dimensional data, and emphasized that the innovations brought by the system allow the decisions to be made quickly by the ballistics expert and greatly increase the success rate.
BALISTICA was exported as part of the SUBA-1 project
Işık noted that the system, which was set up in 10 different regions, including Ankara, covers the whole of Turkey.
The success of the system has opened up the country to foreign markets, Işık said, adding that BALISTICA was exported in the framework of the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia and its installation was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
He said that a new agreement was signed for the second batch sale of BALISTIKA to Saudi Arabia, SUBA-2, which is the continuation of SUBA-1, and that the number of BALISTIKA that will serve Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement that includes the development and installation of 8 additional systems.
A crocodile fossil the size of a bus has been found
A prehistoric sea crocodile was reported to be 10 meters long and weighing 3 tons.
The crocodile's skull alone was measured at 1.6 meters in length.
The researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published their findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti, a co-author of the article from the University of Bologna, said that the fossil, believed to be 130 million years old, was "almost the size of a bus".
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said that the giant saltwater crocodile "was at the top of the food chain at least in a certain area at the time".
Paleontologists have explained that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile ever to live in the sea, was ambushed in lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to have been the Sarcosuchus imperator, which lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 meters in length and weigh 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
The first book of the author Ece Temelkuran, 'All Women's Heads Are Confused' (1996), was adapted for the theatre by Aysa Production Theatre.
The play is directed by Selen Ucher, starring Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Türktan Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez.
Ucher, who is still working on 'Poz' and 'Kuru Sıkı', is experiencing her first experience as a screenwriter and director, and the play questions the confusion in women's minds.
The play met the audience at the Trump Exhibition Center last week.
The play begins with radio drama.
A voice in the dark, that takes us back to the past...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
Who he was and why he tried to kill himself, it's clear from the intervention of his next-door neighbors.
One letter is missing.
'Ebru Uysal' played by Deniz Çakır, a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
He's got stuff he's been collecting since he was a kid.
Not having fatherly affection, being excluded in school, having a lonely childhood, bad relationships, feeling incomprehensible, that's what got her to this point.
He decided to kill himself by leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out of the window.
Because the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Sebnem Sönmez), who lives across the street from the next apartment's chatty and pure cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), keeps her in her tracks.
They're approaching it as if it's a normal, normal process.
She gets more tense and can't concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the three turns into a real turmoil when the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Ipek Türkten Kaynak) who cleans his house also joins in.
'Meltem' approaches the situation in his own naive and sincere way, and when he sees the crowd below, he can't help singing.
This interesting suicide attempt takes on a different dimension when real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Çermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The singer 'Meltem' is giving false information to the press and it's making things worse.
The song 'Street Girl' by Nazan Öncel is also used in the play.
I 'm not sure .
Ucher, who was the first to direct, managed to keep the pace and fluidity of the game.
The comedy of the play is drawn from Zeynep Kankonde and Silk Turk.
The two characters, cartoon characters, manage to make the audience laugh with their facial expressions and lines.
While Sönmez is very good at bringing his years of experience to the stage, Deniz Çakır is also convincing in reflecting the depressed mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who mentioned her name in the award-winning film 'Sarmaşık' by Tolga Çelik, accompanies these four women successfully.
Described as a comedy of crisis, the one-act play promises to be a laugh-out-loud one.
I remember the beautiful words that came out of the mouth of Perran, played mostly by Sebnem Sönmez: they read chaklakalem writing; chaklakalem live, see.
All children have thought of dying once to punish their parents and for some reason they've always cried. Think about it.
She's hanging in the air like an unintelligible joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets the most important part.
Actually, every story begins with some kind of abandonment.
I have to put my hands in my pockets sometimes; I can't stand things without pockets.
You wonder where to put your hands.
The more surprisingly, the more hands we have.
They speak behind their backs, they fabricate and they fabricate.
A misunderstanding is real.
All women are confused because they get confused.
Since you can't die, you have a chance to live.
'Eat the Kafir and live long'
Safe to consume at any age
"It is more nutritious than yogurt because it contains protein, essential minerals and vitamin B", said Kural Enç, a nutritionist who said that the miracle nutrient kefir, which is the main ingredient that does not end with health benefits, but is more useful than milk, is one of the nutrients that can be consumed with absolute certainty at any age.
It's also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
It is the foundation of a healthy nervous system, thanks to its calcium and magnesium content.
It's also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which is also a hunger-killer, is also a weight-loss supplement.
He said, "It is a drink of high value, easy to digest".
The cure for all
Speaking about the fact that children, the elderly, pregnant women and women entering menopause can consume kefir without hesitation, the expert Dietitian Pınar Kural Enç said, "Kefir is a local drink made mainly in the Caucasus".
But now he's starting to announce his name to the world.
The secret of youth is kefir, the potion of a long and healthy life, which is the camel of almost every trouble.
And one of the most natural ways to keep babies from metabolic diseases is to be unfaithful.
Friend of the intestines
This unique drink, which doesn't stop at the benefits, is a friend of the gut.
We have two and a half pounds of bacteria and fungi in our intestines.
The microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into beneficial and harmful.
Beneficial microorganisms are called 'probiotic microorganisms'.
The activities of probiotics are as important as our liver, and when consumed in sufficient quantities, they prevent harmful microorganisms in the intestines from sticking to the intestinal wall and spreading.
The imbalance of healthy microorganisms in the gut causes many diseases.
The digestive tract must be maintained with proper nutrition.
And for that, we must certainly consume sufficient probiotics.
It eliminates these problems in the intestines.
Kefir is the most potent probiotic bacterial nutrient, and the beneficial bacteria it contains have a tremendous effect on strengthening the intestinal system.
It allows beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to multiply and be useful.
Regular use of kefir works the intestines, eliminates intestinal disorders, reduces swelling, and promotes healthier digestion.
A healthy gut system means a healthy body, free of disease.
"Kefir, which is also good for cases such as appetite, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infections and allergies, helps the babies to get more quality vitamins and minerals from food, so it also plays an important role in baby nutrition", he said.

It was learned that Güneş was planning to give the form to Olcay Shahane in the middle field, while Ismail Köybaş, who suffered a minor injury in the last match with the Black Sea representative, was expected to take charge of the first 11.
It 's probably 11 .
The possible 11 of Beşiktaş is:
Tolga Zengin, Beck, Rhodolfo, Ersan Adem Gülüm, Ismail Köybaş, Hutchinson, Quaresma, Oğuzhan, Sosa, Olcay Şahan, Gomez. He was also a member of the board of directors of the company.

Mario Gomez, Luiz Rhodolfo and Andreas Beck, who have three yellow cards in the Super League, will not be able to wear the uniform in the match against Trabzonspor in the week 19 if they see a yellow card against Mersin Idmanyurdu.
The goat of Beşiktaş, Gomez
The eyes will be on the German footballer Mario Gomez in the match between Beşiktaş and Mersin İdmanyurdu.
The 31-year-old, who has also aired the rivals' fillies in his last four league matches in black and white, has climbed to the top of the goal-kingdom competition with this performance.
Gomez, who has played in every game in the first half of the league and scored in 10 of them, has 13 goals in the league.
Meanwhile, another Beşiktaş goalkeeper, Cenk Tosun, scored 3 goals in the first half of the league against Mersin İdmanyurdu in the away match and scored his first "hat-trick" in his professional career.
He's won 12 of the last 15 games.
Beşiktaş has won 12 of his last 15 matches in the Super League.

The technical director crisis in Mersin
Mersin Sports, which could not finish the first half of the Super League where it wanted, had a technical director crisis between the rounds.
The 48-year-old technician was parted ways with Mersin Idmanyurdu, which completed the first half under the leadership of Bülent Korkmaz.
Hakan Kutlu, who was put in charge of the red-laciverts instead of Korkmaz, stayed only one day at the head of the team he had previously run.
In the midst of the period, an extraordinary general assembly was held and Hussein Çalışkan was elected as the club's president. In Mersin İdmanyurdu, an agreement was reached with Nurullah Sağlam, the technical director after the congress, but the 50-year-old coach was only 2 days at the helm of the team.
Mersin Idmaniyurdu will face Beşiktaş without a technical director, as he has not yet reached an agreement on a new name after Nurullah Sağlam.
The touching letters from the little students
The police and soldiers who are conducting terror operations in the district, which is the center of Sur district of Diyarbakir, received letters from children in the west with the purpose of morale.
The first is Aksaray 75.
The students of Istanbul West Ataşehir Natural Science High School and Eskişehir Ataçag Middle School, including the Republic Primary School, started coordinated work.
As a result of these studies, students in schools printed the choreography of the moon-star shape on chocolate, and then wrote nearly a thousand letters, poems, and drawings.
The children sent their work to the Diyarbakir Police Directorate.
The Diyarbakır Police Directorate set up an exhibition table about the coordinated work of children in the west.
The exhibition was held in the new building of the Police Directorate.
The exhibition was visited primarily by police officers and citizens who served in the building of the Police Directorate.
The letters and pictures, with meaningful writing and poetry, moved the reader.
A student who wrote a letter about the operations in the central district of Sur said, "Our beloved police officers, we are grateful for the sacrifice you made to protect innocent people in Diyarbakır".
It's been learned that the exhibition will run until next week.
He named his daughter Angela Merkel.
Another refugee baby has been named after German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticized for her policies towards refugees.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who managed to reach the German city of Duisburg after fleeing the war in Syria, and his wife Tema El Hawar, 21, named their first child "Angela Merkel".
Talking to the German press, Tema El Hawar said: "We are grateful to be here.
We named our daughter Angela Merkel to show that".
Father Memun El Hamza said, "Germany has become like a mother to us".
This is the second 'MERCLE'
It was revealed that the baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27.
According to German media reports, the baby, who weighs 3 kg 300 grams and is 55 centimeters tall, is in good health.
Last year, a refugee from Ghana named her daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees had raised "Mother Merkel" banners in support of Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. at seven-month high
According to university data, UMICH rose 0.7 points in January compared to the end of December to 93.3.
As a result, the market expectation for the index, which has reached its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
Michigan Consumer Research Director Richard Curtin said in a written statement, "Consumer confidence moved upward into the fourth month as expectations for future economic growth improved".
"Individual financing expectations also maintained their highest level since 2007 due to the general weakness in inflation", he said.
The statement also predicted that consumer optimism would now depend on inflation staying exceptionally low.
The UMICH, which posted its best annual performance since 2004 with an average of 92.9 last year, is determined by the results of a 50-question survey of at least 500 people each month.

Putin, he licks his spit
While Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "can do business with Russia" if Turkey cannot meet its services in other ways, the Russian Tour Operators Association has made a statement that "Russian citizens are not giving up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which estimates that the severance of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new draft "Exceptional Situation" for the Russian government regarding Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Federal Regulatory Index, even if Russia enters the sanctions area, it is envisaged that Turkish companies and firms will be allowed to do business with Russia.
According to the draft, Turkish companies and firms will be able to benefit from products and services in cases where it is impossible to obtain from other sources outside Turkey or where local production in Russia will bring significant additional costs.
The category of goods and services of Turkish origin will be determined by a joint commission established by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development in conjunction with other relevant ministries.
So that the bureaucrats can decide which Turkish companies can work with Russia.
According to the same document, Russian state institutions and private companies will have to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not equivalent.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and enters into force, a registry of privileged Turkish companies will be created in Russia.
The Russian Tour Operators Association also said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey.
The statement said: "Despite the ban on tourist sales and the Russian Foreign Ministry's advice not to travel to Turkey, our citizens have started looking for a formula to organize their holidays alone".
The number of posts on social networks with the title 'The most convenient and cheapest way to spend a holiday in Turkey' is growing like a hailstorm.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the oil price drop below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
"Nobody thought that oil would fall to $30", Medvedev said, "and it was a very bad surprise for our government.
It seems that the budget will not be able to be implemented in its current form".
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
After the downing crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that economic sanctions will be further intensified.
In those days, our businessmen, our staff, who were trying to get to Russia in the usual order, were officially annoyed at the border gates.
Turkish goods are being dragged through customs, subject to unthinkable controls.
It's been a month and Nerdun Hajioglu reports from Moscow yesterday.
One way or another, sanctions are easing.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an era of economic globalization, your efforts to close the borders, the way you did a century ago, to turn political strife into economic war, are no longer working.
Look, we're still reporting on Iran and how the economic embargo that's been in place for years is being broken.
Two neighboring countries that seem to be very friendly, but are not so much, like Russia and Turkey, actually need each other.
It's technically impossible to separate these two countries, the businessman, the tourist, the entrepreneur, the client, overnight.
If you close the doors, people from these two countries will enter each other's country through the trunk.
Before the executions create new Reza Zarrabs, it's best to have the political discussion at the table and settle the score.
Without affecting the economy...

The people of Diyarbakır did not support the terrorist act!
According to the information, at 17.00 pm, an action was planned to raise voice against the operations in front of AZC Plaza located on Ekinciler Street in Yenişehir district.
No one participated at the desired level in the vote-raising action, where citizens were invited with leaflets and appeals.
While thousands of people have participated in previous actions, the recent actions have attracted attention because of the lack of support from the citizens.
The group, which could not secure a sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, disbanded without being able to carry out their actions because they did not receive support from Diyarbakır citizens.
Terrorists burned down a school in Diyarbakir
According to the information received, the incident occurred in 1007th Street in Yunus Emre neighborhood of central Bağlar district.

ATM thieves handed over the jacket
Police teams from the Izmir Police Department have started working on complaints of people who have been charged with money from their bank card details.
The police, who identified the perpetrators as M.M.G (43) and R.O (32), said that the suspects copied the card information of citizens with the help of "card copying system" and "mini camera" installed in ATMs in different provinces of Turkey.
The suspects who learned the card passwords were identified as having been using these cards to make transactions.
The operation has led to the arrest of the suspects.
The teams that examined the knee-high computer used by M.M.G. and R.O. seized numerous video recordings of the mini camera system installed to capture the passwords of citizens who transact at ATMs, and determined that the suspects stayed in the provinces for a short time to avoid being caught.
It was also revealed that the suspects obtained 50 thousand lira in unfair earnings through the copying operation they performed at 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects were arrested after their police operations.
Authorities warned citizens to regularly check their account movements against such incidents and to use their hands to screen for passwords when entering ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad should be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the influx of refugees.
Koenders noted that peace in Syria is not possible as long as Assad is in power:
Assad must be tried at the ICC in The Hague.
Someone with so much blood on his hands should be held accountable.
Assad is also solely responsible for the refugee influx we are facing right now.
I am aware that Assad will not be leaving his post anytime soon.
This is a matter that needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs to help in this regard.
Protests against Burak Yılmaz
In the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, when Burak Yılmaz failed to reach the goal he wanted to give to Sneijder, the protest whistles were raised.
Burak Yılmaz reacted to the whistling with a hand gesture.
Then the reaction intensified and whistles of protest were heard as each ball hit the goalkeeper's foot.
Then some stands supported Burak Yılmaz and protested the fans who reacted senselessly to their own players.
Then a large part of the tribunes supported Burak Yılmaz.
There's no inconsistency at Celtic.
While Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad place and will get over it, Griffith doesn't care about the mismatch at Celtic.
The battle of hearts, the SFA's punishment of Neilson, and Warburton's reluctance to sign January's signature that disrupted the team's unity.
The leaders Don's up to five points against Celtic
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty kick gave Aberdeen a legitimate win over Hamilton at Pittodrie, and gave the Dons a chance to create a five-point lead between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the word "inconsistent".
His rumoured dissonance at Celtic was pushed by Griffith's backhand, and he and his teammates were told they were not bothered at all by the increased sense of watching as they prepared to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are anxious about it.
The lack of a Scottish title race is upsetting the Dutchman de Boer.
Ronald de Boer, former Rangers midfielder and former international star of Dutch football, says that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because of the lack of competition with Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax ambassador, said: "They don't give Celtic match summaries anymore in the Netherlands, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
They talk about teams, they talk about it. They're interested in it.
There was a lot of tension at the old team games, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch them.
I'll make things right, Deila swore
RONNY Deila admits Celtic are struggling but the Norwegian boss has indicated that the tide will turn.
The defeat at Malmö and then the Champions League farewell followed, followed by a loss to now five-point leader Aberdeen, who were 10-matches ahead of the rest of the league.
But Deila said, "Celtic have had bad days in the past, and we're going to come back".
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are angry or sad about what's happening.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players feel so much better.
It's so important that we stick together now.
Warburton's January transfer shyness
Despite comments that he had set some January transfer targets just a couple of weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is reluctant to sign, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt Ibrox's squad.
His former Brentford coach said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
For players who come in the summer, there's a pre-season period where you get them used to it, and we've seen that in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu for retirement
Michu from Swansea forward linked up with Celtic in the transfer window, and ruined predictions that he would retire when his contract with the Swans expired.
At the age of 29, he suffered from a problematic ankle for two years, and could not find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts are preparing for the SFA battle over Neilson's comments.
When Paterson was sent off, the Hearts led 2-1 and then lost 3-2, turning everything upside down after the defensive player's red card - Collum's third red card to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson does not give up, he insists: "I never questioned the unity, I never commented on the performance".
Griffiths tried to stop Tynecastle.
Obsessed Hibee was reprimanded for singing a song that contained offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 at Tynecastle, in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, just before the Edinburgh Derby.
"It was a derby and there was the heat of the moment", the striker said, adding: "I can definitely say that I will not go to Tynecastle from now on except for a game against Celtic.
The Tannadice board has confidence in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly is still confident that the Dundee United board of directors will fix things - but they agree that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're gonna get the kids ready to go again", Donnely said.
Mclness pleased with "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek McLness admits Aberdeen's team had to cling desperately to the Hamilton Accies to see them win their seventh straight, taking them five points clear of Celtic in the league table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInes said: "Whether it's cups or leagues, no team wins anything without winning matches in this way".
Unemployment rates in England are rising, but the rates among Scots are the same.
UNemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed people in the whole of England rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than in England, which was 5.5 per cent.
In Scotland, on the other hand, employment fell by 12,000 in three months to 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent - up from the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland's Minister of State, David Mundell, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's been almost a full year since the historic day when Scotland decided to remain part of England.
In the last 12 months, we've seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I Witnessed an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, I'm going to watch a man be killed by a late-night legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the death-room surveillance gallery at Oklahoma State Prison while Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He wanted me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through her best friend in January, and as shocked as I was, I accepted.
As that day approached, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It will offer a unique perspective.
That's right, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and with more applications than available sites, there's a terrible lottery going on to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma's media seats are down from 12 to five.
Whoever gets elected will watch without feeling.
I can't do that.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the past few months through phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials told me that I could not be a witness or a journalist, so I would not be given a pencil or a notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
That's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to him.
He admitted he could have "put it better" but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me on some of the things I say and write.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the witness list whenever he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there and write about it.
If he dies, he thinks that if it's made public, it'll help the anti-death penalty movement.
I'll be joined by a reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to my podcast series.
I'm not gonna go through all the details here.
I have no idea that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What he did after Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is absolutely no evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch her die from that perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can check with the other reporters there.
The impressions you'll get from me will be the impressions you'll get from watching the death of a man she likes who was unnecessarily murdered.
After a thorough police chase, the man was convinced he was from Canning River.
The Canning Vale police officer was left dry while he convinced the man to get out of the Canning River.
The alleged escape from a Perth man's police car in the shallow muddy water ended with a police officer "gently persuading himself to return to shore".
Canning Vale police have been called in to the Beckenham break-in on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape the police by diving into the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"The bold Deputy Lieutenant Shandell Castledine, standing in the water himself, said, 'I'm not coming out, 'come get me.'
Officer Lachlan Perhavec refused to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Deputy Commissioner Castledine said, "Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape".
The champion football player, Ben Cousins, is a perennial example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to escape a police alcohol check and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but it inspired the local people to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for fun.
Peter Moody claimed the stewards had slandered him and threatened to stop him from racing
Peter Moody has claimed that the stewards of Racing Victoria tried to set up a riot in their own stables last year and threatened him to quit the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the stewards and the union department, and said they were running a personal campaign against her to disqualify Lady Tatai from the final feed for the race on the Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do his best in racing, and told Lidari that when the job tested positive for cobalt, he found himself in difficult circumstances that he couldn't explain.
He said he bit his tongue for 18 months in response to the slander allegations, not wanting to "look like a grapefruit".
"I wasn't gonna say this, and I kept it to myself for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry and everything just happens", Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you suffer the consequences, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want to walk upright and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking I didn't do it, it means I shouldn't be a runner anymore.
I wondered what I'd do with my license.
Moody had earlier detonated a bomb in a racing.com interview accusing the union department of being in the business of slandering his own barn.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'll call him if asked - and they offered to give him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in the stables", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they're all gonna have to return their briefs because they weren't talented enough to catch me.
Former RVL president Robert Roulston, new RVL president David Moodie and the current RVL CEO knew it then and they know it now.
Does that make me think it's getting personal?
RVL has a number of balls, and maybe he wants to hold someone outside of the executives responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and kick me out, but I have no doubt what I say will make them think.
But I'm not expecting anything at this point, and it makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I'll put pressure on them, I'll put the responsibility of making decisions on them.
I have my family's support, and I'm walking away.
The driver's frustration with the long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari and the subsequent scratch incident led him to say "throw my license across the table".
Moody, who gained fame for training the undefeated champion Black Hawar, called the race day care rule "ridiculous", stating that it was against the rules to spray mud or clay on the horse's feet.
That's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this".
One of my guys accidentally put mud on his foot.
He could have gotten it last night.
He could have gotten it yesterday, which he did.
He took the day off.
Moody could face a three-month suspension for using a racing-day scooter as a result of an investigation by the officials.
This is a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The hit-and-run driver in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man who ran off a bike in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the driver fled the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a man in his 50s from Nathalia turned himself in at the Shepparton police station.
He's expected to be charged with non-stop, non-aiding and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old Cobram cyclist remains in stable condition at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has responded harshly to rivals' claims about wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticism targeting his own team as an attempt to "set the agenda" for the NRL's two favourite premierships.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed him to "fight" his own team in the semi-final game in Sydney on Friday night, when the Storm were booed.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a rather unconventional reference to the Storm after their semi-final win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling it an "exemplary" match for rugby league, and saying the two Oueenslands were "not too big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggle, saying that when they struggle, they focus only on "contact".
Bellamy said he was encouraged by the criticism of his two top hockey teams because it meant they were worried the Storm would beat them.
It's coming up - when we lost 24-2, I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our techniques all year, only in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on our combat contacts, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously he's coaching a great team, and he's probably not used to losing to a little shock for himself.
Funny that it happened this time of year.
Bellamy objected to Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminding Bennett of his coach who won the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons championship by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was talking about comparing his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and how exciting their game was".
I remember back in 2010, when St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't give a rat's ass.
But now they have a team that's going to play exciting football, and especially with their speed and their young half.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He put that point in 2010, and now everybody wants to play football that way -- every team doesn't have half-backs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that way.
That gives me more confidence because even they're a little shy about playing.
They probably didn't think of us six weeks ago when they went to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters game had higher scores than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the score?
Our game is 20-18, our game is both sides score more, but is this exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut the attacks but not score?
That's my agenda.
If they're talking about us, that means we're gonna meet them here at some point.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks won't be this weekend as they've earned the right to host one of their first finals, which is on sale Tuesday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released on $ 200,000 bail for drug offence
A man who was caught with 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland and faced a possible life sentence has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people arrested by federal police last month for tracking 100kg of drugs from a Solay yacht that came from South America via Vanuatu and was docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with his accomplices at the marina throughout the morning and later meeting them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilograms of drugs inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of commercial cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess all the drugs and that he may have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
The Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was at risk of escape.
They have clear connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", he said in court on Wednesday.
In the civil case, he lied to the police about where he was staying.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather have offered together $200,000 for his release on bail.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 bail offer represents a real financial burden on them", Judge Flanagan said.
But he warned that this alone was not enough to keep him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for surrendering both his Australian and Serbian passports, and for complying with the daily police station visit ban and the 6pm-6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request child abuse footage.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, and provided a series of inappropriate child pornography sent to her by another user.
She woke up later and realized her phone was gone and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She looked at him and noticed the disturbing messages before she could alert her mother.
The police became interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches using terms that were intended to find inappropriate child images.
Hogg later claimed to the officers that the reason he did this was to "manage the paedophiles on the Internet" and "act like the police and scare them".
Financial Ombudsman Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - an addiction that scared people.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but he said he did it to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
Questions were asked about the conversations between the unknown person who sent him the pictures and himself, who asked him to send more pictures of them.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said that when he drank, he got sick with thoughts and wanted to watch rape and murder footage.
"When she found the messages on her phone", added Ms. Robertson, "she called out to her mother, and she was shaking and crying.
Mom saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the accusations followed.
She was interviewed, and she said that the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to make himself look younger than he was.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking or producing indecent images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said it was questionable whether Hogg should be classified as a sex offender because there was no "significant sexual element" in the charge.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case until October, when the social history report will be released.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but was remanded in custody for other unusual cases.
Sexual offenses were recorded before the sentencing date.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made a wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs while coming off a podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was marred by allegations that opposition MPs had received anonymous death threats if they waved at Mr Mugabe during his speech.
They had repeatedly interrupted him during his address to the nation in parliament last month - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received messages on their mobile phones urging them not to disturb Mr Mugabe during his speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech, the message to reporters comes from an unseen number but with the headline 'death,'" he said.
He says that the immunity of members is valid inside the parliament and that when they leave the parliament, the immunity does not work.
The chief spokesman expressed "concern" over the threats against politicians of the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and reduce costs in corporate services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer business from the fastest-growing hardware and services operations.
HP said in a statement that the expected layoffs would result in a cost of about $2.7 billion at the start of the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, HP's president and CEO, who will chair the unit after the split, said, "These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company".
"Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio to help companies transition to the new way of doing business", he said.
As a separate company, we're in a much better position than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Corporation will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will focus on "providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions for companies".
He divides his Palo Alto garage into two, the birthplace of Silicon Valley, a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is one of the latest moves in the industry to believe that focused firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his teammates are having problems with Wilshere's injury ahead of the Dinamo Zagreb game
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, there was no reason why he should not play in the Christmas line-up.
The best-case scenario already means Wilshere will miss at least four games in England and, given his track record, it is as uncertain as it seems whether he will be in the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing part of the final problem is that Wilshere finished strong last season after injuring a separate ankle and then looking for his old pre-season sharpness.
This kind of disability is not a career threat, Wenger said.
This is a bone that hasn't fully healed.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with her wrists or her previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, that may be true, but as Wenger will admit, there is a risk of further injury to a player who returns mid-season.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
According to research by Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different medical conditions recorded since his debut six years ago.
He's played just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
In the big picture, Arsenal are one of two Premier League teams to lose six of eight seasons since 2007-08, mostly due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the potential for a spinoff, but Arsenal believe the recovery from last season's injury record will take time.
"Sometimes when you're coming back from an injury, you're going through a period of being vulnerable, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust it, and I believe he'll have the career he deserves.
The Champions League match against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, against Arsenal on Saturday, and the match against Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, Wenger is preparing his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which makes sense as Mathieu Debuchy is going to play Arteta.
Wenger could start with Nacho Montreal and Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Theo Walcott.
"I try to maintain the balance and give the players the breath they need", Wenger said.
Despite being Arsenal's clear favourite in Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most feared stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo have not lost 41 games since last season, when they produced their own "Invincible" campaign.
The stadium was shaken by a magnitude 3.2 earthquake on the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
This is the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lesson from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and continues to be motivated by the distant goal of winning the club's first European Cup.
"It's a huge motivation", says Wenger. "It's a great motivation to be here".
It's never happened at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm experienced enough to be realistic.
We are passionate, but we are not visionary.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of similar portals in the program is remarkable, especially at a time when men are more in need of opening, and when the suicide rate among young men is at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45, and it was three times more common in men than women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Campaign Against Miserable Living (CALM) has declared 2015 as the Year of the Man, and aims to counter a culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to accomplish this challenging task.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression showed that a person with this disorder had a twofold chance of recovery if he had a high number of "healthy-mode" friends.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the mental challenges that may arise.
But of course, for friendship to work, it has to be accessible first.
In this age of social media-heavy communication, with a focus on style over content, it's making immediate response a priority over meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like powerful, fun-loving, successful people, even when isolation is really the key.
Artificial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- that are pursued and squandered by inner values that have a deeper impact on our mental health -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship.
As a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned that focus upside down.
The characters were defined not by their work, but by their personalities, and they showed that by their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments they watched football in their comfortable chairs, Ross's affair with Rachel all stemmed from the knowledge that men could actually relate to them even if they were at a backdrop in expressing their feelings fully.
What one charity worker told me is, "...listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I've seen how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference".
Most of the men we've contacted haven't been able to talk to their friends.
"A feeling like 'going away' is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness".
One of the programs that came to mind when I suggested long-term coping mechanisms was Friends.
He highlighted the little moments of his boyhood.
My goal is that a stranger status on the phone helps people in times of need, but long-term support comes from family and friends who have close personal networks.
And if you're going to be at FriendsFest on Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes have been redesigned for celebration?
Or, better yet, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship will make.
Friends, airing from start to finish on Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria's goal made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal for Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easy for PSG to overtake rivals with a goal against Sweden in Malmö at the start of the Champions League on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
In a match between Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League match with a very comfortable and clear 2-0 win over Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal in the fourth minute, which was a PSG player that allowed the French champions to continue their way in the Champions League, but they did not take advantage of the opportunities until the second goal, scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
They needed a strong start against the Swedish champions of Paris, who were in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, not only to get out of the knockout groups but also to improve on their quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But his score was not the best of the season for Laurent Blanc's team, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of time in the penalty area and was later sidelined against his hometown team, with whom he began his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League, inside or outside, so it's a good start to give a good impression afterwards, even though we have to improve on some things during the season", Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though I was worried we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to Paris after injury in a 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 over the weekend, one of three changes made, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was seen as a player who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was transferred from Manchester United last month, and Marco Veratti's passing by the back of Malmö's defence and the beautiful shot that sent Johan Wiland into the back of the field from the far corner proved that those who thought so were not right.
However, everyone was disappointed when PSG won a big victory.
To qualify for this round, Malmö had nine international players lined up, a five-man defense and two midfield depth players, a heavy opponent who had beaten Celtic in the play-offs.
In the 34th minute, they made very little of an attack except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic that hit the cornerstone of Kevin Trapp's guard.
PSG, on the other hand, allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and ineffective shots, Ibrahimovic failed to make the final move in at least five attacks in the first half and disappointed by not keeping up with Cavani's play when the second half began.
However, he proved even more adept when it came to organising his teammates, it was Ibrahimovic who passed the foul shot sent by Di Maria to Wiland's fort in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came an hour later thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season with a goal from Maxwell's left wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö's hopes of a return to the game were exhausted and after the unnumbered goal scored irregularly by Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, Wiland saved David Luiz's shot in the empty position perfectly and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class ahead of his own team, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level as him.
The teams in the squad are not enough.
Paris is a hat-trick.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in sales.
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, sold its shares Wednesday to raise $2.5 billion as part of a debt-splitting plan.
Glencore, which is listed in London, has announced that it has sold £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, has been hit hard by falling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown causes an increase in demand and causes market turmoil.
The issue of the right caused Glencore's stock price to rise on the London stock exchange early Wednesday morning.
The shares opened 0.69 per cent higher in the FTSE 100 index, rising 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence.
Glencore last week announced a $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of plans to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold its new shares at 125p per share, a 2.4 percent discount from Tuesday's closing.
He sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
While concerns about China's long-term growth have slashed iron ore prices roughly in half, coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The statement said that Xi's first official visit to Washington, which will take place on September 25, is a return visit to Barack Obama, who visited Beijing in November.
After the bilateral talks between the two heads of state, the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit will expand U.S.-China cooperation on regional and global issues as well as bilateral relations, and will allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively address issues of disagreement".
Xi, who first announced his visit in February, is expected to visit Seattle before Washington to meet with some US technology leaders, and then travel to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss some controversial issues, including Washington's concerns over allegations of Chinese cyber espionage and China's claims to sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes diversity in filmmaking seem unimportant.
Matt Damon has challenged African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it's not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate over diversity.
In the Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, which aired on HBO, Brown interrupted the veteran actor as he emphasized the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the project's chosen script.
Damon argued that when it comes to diversity, you do it in the cast of the show, not the cast of the movie.
Shocked, Brown responded that the actor of the Martian film was against it, with statements like "Wow! Wow. Okay".
Damon and Brown were brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
Brown said first, "I wanted to get people to think about how they should treat the Adaptation character, regardless of who the director is".
The only black character is a whore shot by a white love teller.
Dear White People's publisher insisted on directing the film with finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, to whom Damon replied that their assignments "could end up the way we didn't want them to".
After the debate was published, there was an outpouring of dissatisfaction on social media over Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the cut, writing, "Matt Damon can explain his diversity about this person as being painful to the WHITE JESUS because he's talking about the only black person in the room".
After the tweet was sent, it got 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at a time when the right expression of race in the media was at the forefront of social debate.
After the 2014 murder of a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement has effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials nationwide to stop discriminating against people of color.
In February, singer Prince spoke out about the movement at the Grammy Awards, where the nominees for Album of the Year were announced.
He said albums are still important.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to a question from Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent figure on Fox News, about whether the group should be classified as a hate group.
The leaders said, "Black Lives Matter Network is a charity group".
It was recently announced that Damon was included in a list of entertainers, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear if he's accepted the invitation or if he's met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior crowned first champion
Professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the $1 million prize by winning the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night.
The competition, now in its seventh season, had never seen a competitor complete all stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to stay in the final round.
The final task was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the parkour in time, and thus managed to become the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won by finishing the parkour three seconds ahead of him.
Following this hard-fought victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News in shock at winning the grand prize of $1 million.
Isaac told E!' about a huge increase in his salary, "I think it's amazing to even think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or been able to make a living".
I mean, it just happened, I can't imagine what it's like, the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final, and Britten explained why no prize would be awarded, even though she was the first contestant to finish the run.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest.
Weed said, "If there's more than one finisher, the fastest finisher wins the prize".
Although the money is a great prize and life-changing, he won a big jackpot.
I don't think he has a bad idea about it.
He's very happy that he did what he did.
He's got tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said, "If anyone can beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac".
I think if their roles had changed, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
American Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have beaten the Minnesota Twins by a wide margin.
The second half of the season hasn't been very enjoyable for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, once one of the best in baseball, are now in the bottom half of the American League Central.
The Tigers, who were down to the wire, put on a perfect game on Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins have lost their chance to advance to the American League Second Division wild card by overtaking the Houston Astros by half a point.
For Detroit, it was a return to a good game, which had been rare for most of the second half of the season, even if it was a one-night stand.
In the words of Tigers manager Brad Ausmus, "victory is all fun, no matter what".
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon, who had three hits in Detroit's first two at-bats, was able to score a run on the sixth and ninth pitches, showing early offensive support.
Simon (13-9) had six 3/1-pointers, three of which were runs.
That was only the third good start in the last nine rounds.
"I just want to close the year strong", Simon said.
It's hard for the reserves to miss every game, so I wanted to dive in.
Tigers' designated hitter Victor Martinez hit three home runs and drove in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
This was the first of three straight nights on this side since Martinez won four against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the bat tight", said Ausmus.
He looked good, and he was already noticeably better at BP, which he kept in the game.
The Twins, who had three runs in the bottom of the seventh, had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the batting line with a double off the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was only able to make a slow shot, and Simon caught second-row Brian Dozier to make the shot as he swung before lifting for left fielder Blaine Hardy.
Mauer, the only player to pass right-winger Drew Verhagen in two runs, boldly advanced against striker Miguel Sano.
In the second tie-breaker, VerHagen managed to draw a pair of runners and third-striker Trevor Plouffe into a double.
Plouffe's hit on the DP was his 27th in the majors this season.
After struggling for Detroit's ninth-guarantee run, Mauer passed the RBI and opened the gap with the Tigers, going 5-4 and closing in on Bruce Rondon.
However, he was caught for Sano on three throws for the right fifty-fifth save.
Detroit has an advantage with a disfigured Phil Hughes coming out early.
The Tigers have won three runs in their first two outings against the seasoned right fielder who has been out of the field for more than a month due to a back injury.
"It's not the game I want to play", Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable and I managed to throw pretty well on the third shots".
After a successful shot in the first, Hushes took second-striker Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right fielder J.D. Martinez's two-time outs left Victor Martinez alone on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez raced the runners to overcome the 0-21 mark in the scoring position.
Third-row Nick Castellanos followed with a single right, giving him another run, but Victor Martinez was sent off as he tried to make the third, so the threats were over.
The Tigers added in the second, winning a pair of outs from catcher James McCann and a two-out from center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
Paul Molitor, the Twins' manager, said it was a "big hit".
He didn't hit it very well, but he hit it right.
Hughes, the pitcher, threw three scoreless innings until he was replaced by right fielder A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six hits and four walks.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has been ruled out due to shoulder pain he used to throw.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the disabled list since mid-August due to shoulder pain, is scheduled to begin work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, the Twins will be facing off against LHP Daniel Norris DL.
Norris and the Tigers are 1-1 in four games since the July 30 game for David Price.
He hasn't played since August 20th because of pain in his right side.
The Tigers and the Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP, is going to have to deal with Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open up the economy to the world more
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with leading reforms that the economy needs to be more open to the outside world to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Central Leadership Group meeting on Strengthening General Reforms, the President said, "China should develop its opening-up policies by attracting foreign investment expertise".
Xi said that while encouraging opening up, new reforms will bring new energy and vitality, creating a new space for economic growth.
The leadership group adopted a series of recommendations, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, encouragement of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to invest in private capital, and a review of settler registration systems.
The statement said a negative list of sectors and business sectors that are prohibited for investment will be prepared.
The system will be tested and developed through pilot programs.
This is an important step, because it will give the market a bigger role in allocating resources and make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen its control over the companies, allowing the companies to run their own business.
The statement also stated that China will explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation in border areas and introduce new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More space will be opened up for private investment to open up the state-controlled sectors.
The statement said, "The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and will provide better services to foreign-funded companies while protecting their interests".
In addition, the requirements for obtaining permanent residence permits or "green cards" for foreigners will be simplified by streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practice and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
A statement released after the meeting said that Premier Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bags are very fashionable now.
In the fashion world, the roads turn and come to the bags.
The trend that's been emerging lately is that miniatures...
You can tell that the little bags attached to the big ones are also noticeable.
They say everything is beautiful when it's small.
I think that's the same view of bags.
I could barely get enough of walking the streets with suitcases the size of suitcases, and suddenly the wind started blowing in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
We already had small bags, but this time they came in the miniature form of the big bags.
These are tiny bags that only your phone, credit card and keys can fit in.
The trend that started with Céline and Hermès spread with Prada.
The transformation of bag admiration into miniature fascination also affected the emerging models.
Loewe has presented the fun bags he's made this season in two sizes.
The most elephant-like of the bags are the panda, the polar bear, and the elephant.
The mini-sizes of the big bags, which luxury brands offer with phenomenal names, seem to have attracted the most red carpet celebrities.
The "Birkin" bag that Hermes made for Jane Birkin is one of the most popular.
Although Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn't want her name mentioned in a bag, it's now part of the memories.
Fashion weeks have seen a massive influx of mini bags.
And the mini bags are on the podium.
They're so tiny, you can't really wear them on your arm.
They can be used with long suspensions and cross-sections.
But on the podium, we've seen more of those long pendants wrapped around the wrists of models.
Fendi is the one who takes the mini-bag thing to the next level.
For those of you who can't fit in the mini bag, but can't give them up, he has a suggestion.
Big bags and friends and mini bags.
What's that?
By turning mini bags into a piece of jewelry that can be attached to the big ones.
This one that's been on the podium, it's gotten a quick boost on the street.
Let's see what else we'll see!
Skin changes in the skin
Turkey is competing with the world's brands in denim.
He's now enriching that experience in manufacturing with design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that the black models that used to be a few now start to take their place on the shelves every season.
In a season where the blacks are so high, denim has found its best friend.
Leather fragments and elaborate designs stand out as the rebellious friends of denim.
Generally, short models with zippers called "motorbike" are in vogue.
The strong skin is complemented by black pieces, long shirts and glossy sweaters, which give a sporty look.
In the old days, young people would wear socks and disappear in the crowd.
Thought it would save the day.
Now the youngsters want to wear something that emphasizes elegance as well as comfort.
So, you can say that Loft has a good understanding of the target audience with the collections and the complementary pieces.
Small for Banksy, big for global
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together works by the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building, which is the product of 15 years of work by the artist and brings together 85 original works for the first time.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul was opened the day before at Global Karaköy (Rihtym Street).
The world-famous artist, who hides his identity and uses pseudonyms, was not at the opening, of course.
We don't know if he's been to Istanbul.
But according to Steve Lazaridas, the curator of the exhibition, Bansky doesn't even know about this exhibition.
There's no reason to ask her permission.
Because old friends, Bansky and Lazaridas, parted ways after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits are by Lazaridas, others by collectors.
But there are things that Bansky's followers are wondering.
I wonder what Banksy would think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", which is a collection of 85 works.
How would he feel about the admission to the exhibition, for example, and the small store at the end of the 800-square-foot gallery space?
Would it make a sound that his works, which draw attention to the wounds of the world, like Girl in the Red Balloon, The Cleaner, Rose Now, were printed on diaper bags, wallets, necklaces?
The fact that an exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit who hides his identity is so consumed is a disappointment to the followers of Banksy.
It's not Banksy at all.
But you still have to buy a limited number of tickets before they sell out!
Banksy's big exhibition for the small, globalized world, "The Art of Banksy", is on view through April.
They are the wrongdoers.
Let them dig a ditch.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the communiqué.
Erdogan: "These are cruel, these are mean".
Those who are unjust are unjust.
He said, "They are guilty of the same crime, for they are with those who commit murder".
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who left a carnation in place of the blast in Sultanahmet, said, "I shared our sorrow with both the German President and the German Chancellor for the death of 10 of our German friends in this action in Sultanahmet Square, which is a peaceful square that smells of history and civilization - especially near the German Fountain.
I want to convey my condolences to the German people, and first of all to the families of those who died here".
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination", he said.
Reacting to the academics who signed the statement, Erdogan said: "I especially condemn, I strongly condemn the academics who stand up against all these terrorist incidents and publish a black statement and sign the signatures under those massacres".
The fact that our people have a much better understanding of who they are, that is, that there is a professor, an associate professor in front of them, doesn't make anyone intelligent.
These are the dark people.
They are the wrongdoers, and they are the humiliated.
They have committed the same crime because they are with the slaughterers.
Where are these dark academics going to put the three-year-old Mevlüde, who was martyred with her father in the incident in Çinar?
How can they possibly feel guilty about siding with his killers?
I call upon all the judicial authorities, the senates of the universities, to take action against our constitution and our laws.
Yesterday, I said that the steps that need to be taken must be taken quickly.
Let them do whatever they have to do.
Those who want to do politics, let them do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, then they can dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm speaking so plainly and clearly.
TEOG results released
The results of the transition system from basic education to secondary education (TEOG) examination for 8th grades were announced by the Ministry of National Education (MEB).
The results of the test, which took place on November 25-26, have finally been revealed.
Weighted Common Exam Score: Within the scope of Common Exams, the scores from the lessons that the exam is conducted are multiplied by their own weight coefficients.
The value obtained from the sum of the multiples is the periodically weighted common test score for each term by dividing the weighting coefficients of the lessons by the sum of the coefficients.
The arithmetic mean of periodically weighted common test scores constitutes the weighted common test score.
Scoring is based on 700 points.
The basic score for placement: the 6th, 7th and 8th grade year-end achievement scores are combined with the 8th grade weighted common test score.
The total score is divided by two to get the base score.
Scoring is based on 500 points.
Faculty members are being marked

And underneath the paper, the words "Gazi Communications"... were added.
The 1128 academics who signed the statement titled 'We will not be partners in this crime' of the group called 'Academics for Peace Initiative' received numerous reactions, including from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and government officials.
Academics who were investigated for their signatures began to be detained and removed from office.

'I found 26 people while looking for two wrestling kids'
The second documentary by Mete Gümürhan, "Young Pehlivan", 66.
He was the first Turkish documentary filmmaker to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (February 11-21).
Gümürhan, who is originally from Edirne but has a production company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he shot the documentary, which he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivan" tells the story of a six-year-old boarding school student from Amasya who aspires to become a world champion in wrestling.
Young Pehlivanlar, the first Turkish documentary to be selected for this category, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear award.
Although born and raised in the Netherlands, Mete Gümürhan is originally from Edirne.
When he was a child, he came to Turkey on summer vacation, he heard greasy wrestling stories from his grandfather and watched the competitions.
"There are no political problems in Turkey".
I wanted to tell the world about what else was going on in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling is not very well known in our horse sports". He wants to get together with 6 directors and make a documentary project.
This project is inconclusive, but one day a magazine article he reads on the plane opens the door to another project for Gümürhan.
'We stayed at the sugar factory'
Following the story of two young brothers, a 10-11 year old wrestler, Mete Gümürhan goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The father of the children won't let us shoot the documentary.
Gümürhan explains how he overcame the challenge: "I spent the whole day thinking about what I could do.
Because the Ministry of Culture could withdraw its support".
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids were going.
I was thinking about going there.
I was looking for two kids, and I ran into 26 kids at school who were into wrestling.
We started shooting in a week and we finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the sugar factory dormitory".
The filming was completed in three weeks, and the director's biggest challenge was language.
Gümürhan said that three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign film director and voice actor worked, "I didn't know what I was going to encounter while filming".
"They didn't know Turkish either", he says.
Young Warriors focuses on the stories of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Baran, who was raised by his grandfather and had weight problems, Harun, who couldn't attend training because of a broken arm, Beytullah, who was ambitious but had health problems, the cute boy of the school, Umit, the youngest champion, Ahmet, and Muhammad, who kept the group together...
Mete Gümürhan describes her work with children: "I left them completely natural".
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I did the first week and a half of training.
I wanted the kids to pretend there was no camera.
"Fortunately, they quickly got used to it".
It's a surprise to be chosen for Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan said that he did not expect Young Pehlivanlar to be selected for the Berlin Film Festival, "We were ready, but it was a surprise that we were selected for Berlin".
Young Pehlivan is not a sports documentary, but a production that tells the struggles of children and the incidents of their lives.
"I wanted to highlight the stories of children who were struggling with family problems and their struggles to find identity and cope", she says.
Support for academics from the art world
After the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative", the storm that followed led to the investigation and detention of the academics yesterday, while on the other hand, there are the statements of support.
Initial support came from literary figures, including many famous names.
The day before, the filmmakers, and yesterday the theatricalists, they announced their support.
In a statement signed by 138 theatre artists, "We stand with this honorable gathering of Academics who, as artists working in the field of theatre and performing arts, are calling for peace, we declare that we stand with freedom of expression, equality, the right to life and unconditional peace".
"We join with our conscience and with all our heart in the academic call for negotiation and peace".
More than 400 filmmakers including Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Ünlü, Yesim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik, and others said, "We are on the side of free thought and art.
Without "but" but without "if", we are not partners in this crime.
We are with the Academics for Peace Initiative".
The Society of Cinematographers (SIAAD) issued a statement saying, "We stand with the academics who have been targeted by the lynching campaign".
The Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement on January 11 in Ankara and Istanbul, calling on the government to negotiate peace and "We are not partners in this crime".
The text was signed by 1,128 academics at 89 universities, as well as thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who are world-renowned for their theories and books.
President Erdogan and Prime Minister Davutoglu sharply criticized the academics' statement as "terror support", and Erdogan called on the institutions to "do what needs to be done".
After this call, some universities shut down the academics, while the prosecution launched a fresh investigation.
Yesterday, a large number of academics were detained.
Your fan, please help!
The red hair of the Hurrem Sultan, the Beren nose, the Justin hair...
While trying to be like a celebrity is somewhat normal, it's seen as a psychological disorder once it starts to affect the whole of life.
Celebrity worship syndrome, also known as celebrity worship syndrome, is a topic that has become academic around the world, and we're just starting to talk about it.
It's pretty normal for women to run to the hairdresser's with pictures of celebrities.
But let's not forget the year of the 'Hurrem Sultan' when all the teenagers were walking around Ireland with red hair.
It's already been reported that the "Beren nose" is the leader in cosmetic surgery in 2015.
It's not much different on the gentlemen's side.
There was a time when it was common to dress like a steel-clad man.
Now the wind is blowing in the opposite direction.
We're surrounded by teenagers who are just like Justin Bieber.
So much so that this unnecessary information has been read thousands of times on the Internet: "First, when you go to the barber shop, cut your hair sideways, above the ears, and around the top of your head".
The single sides will be short.
After the cutting process is over, you should shape your hair with mild water.
When the shaping is complete, fix your hair with the help of a spray.
"To get Justin's hair, you have to do it when it's wet".
All of this brings to mind the newly talked about celebrity worship syndrome, which has become an academic topic around the world.
We see celebrity fans as a love potion.
Artists brag about their fan numbers, how much it impresses them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it that simply.
Especially is it debated whether teenagers should decide what to eat and drink, what to listen to, what to wear according to celebrities.
Over-attachment to names that are presented as inaccessible is defined as a psychological disorder of role-modeling.
Specialist psychologist Sumaye Demir admits that Turkey is lagging behind in studies in this area.
But he also notes that families are gradually becoming aware: "One of the fundamental questions of psychology is that of man's reconciliation with himself, of his own identity".
It used to be that kids filling their rooms with posters, someone dressed up as a man, it wasn't taken very seriously.
That's changing now.
He feels the need to intervene.
"A passionate commitment to someone is a sign that something is wrong with a young person's life".
Fans riding on the emotional speed train
The interest in celebrities is harmless, as long as it doesn't go too far.
Demir suggests that you pay attention to signs of not wanting to marry, jealous of your spouse, or preferring her clothing.
We're talking about famous people.
It's pretty normal to be curious about them, to be concerned about their lives.
But the expert psychologist concludes that the young who miss the mark often say: "When there are no names in the family or in the community that will represent the child in terms of virtue and good behavior, that void is sure to be filled".
Good examples don't always come up.
"He's copying the bad luck, too".
When we consulted them on how to approach them, the Iron Throne began by reminding us that the fame-seeking syndrome is more common in adolescence.
It's easier to overcome the problem, considering that adolescents can be insecure.
We are confronted with young people who, while complaining about their family's limitations, are also looking for support and sympathy: "We have to take into account their emotional ups and downs".
New research suggests that they're being challenged by changes in their brains.
"The passionate attachment of a young person on the emotional speed train should be naturally received, gently approached".
You can change your behavior .
Psychologist Sumaye Demir reminds parents of their responsibilities to overcome the fame-worship syndrome:
Recognize his emotional distress, and make sure you're calm before you get into it.
Never let it get in the way of your feelings.
To encourage independence, show respect for his admiration.
Instead of teaching by criticizing, set a good example, discuss role models.
Try to discuss celebrity roles in our daily lives together.
It would be helpful to read books about the real world of celebrities together.
Make sure you're communicating in an adult-to-adult fashion.
Remember, addiction and motivation work the same way in the brain.
Tell your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accepting them as they are.
Make sure you get some expert support on the fan base.
The angry and the envious are admired
The root of celebrity worship syndrome is the need to seek help and support from others.
Unstoppable love is a cry for help.
But unfortunately, it's not perceived that way.
And it's so widespread that it's not confined to one country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu points out that in every country there are certain names that occupy the television.
It's more of a connection to these celebrities: "They're extraordinary".
The general majority do not have the means.
Those who do, don't live like them.
Either they don't embrace it or they don't have the courage.
"But those who either can't afford it or can afford it, and can't live like them, continue to watch nervously".
It's not really a difference between jealous and nervous.
They both have a deep admiration.
They make easy money, they're on the magazine's agenda.
Just knowing that is enough to increase the fan base.
Another advice from expert psychologist Sumaye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It should not be overlooked that artificial life is at stake.
And that's where the support of the community comes in for the person who's passionate about fame.
But the person is adamant that the celebrity he's a fan of has problems just like he does.

Should I have a gallbladder operation?
Dr. Fevzi Özgönül is answering questions in his corner of the Meydan Gazete.
I have a stone in my gallbladder, and every morning when I get up, I go to the bathroom with a stomach ache after meals, two or more times a day.
Could that be keeping me from losing weight?
I'm just starting to use alkaline, but I'm not losing any weight.
Since I was a kid.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: Gallstones are often accompanied by an infection.
These abdominal pain symptoms that occur immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, your gallbladder is constricted and you're flushing inflamed bile into your intestines.
The intestines, which are disturbed by inflamed bile, try to quickly expel it.
That's why you guys go to the bathroom so much.
And because you go to the bathroom so often, your food gets thrown out before it's digested, and you lose weight slowly.

A child who feels worthless becomes addicted to 'hate'
There are certain feelings that are innate in the human world of feelings.
Fear, sadness, happiness, confusion, anger, worry... It's not what you think.
But feelings of hatred, resentment, and revenge come up in children over time and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Every human being needs to be an individual, including childhood.
That is, he wants to respect the decisions of his parents or his social circle, to be consulted on matters that concern him, and to feel valued.
These are the foundations of a healthy personality.
For example, such actions as not making decisions for the child in matters that concern him (such as what to wear or what to eat) or ignoring his wishes and instead giving up his own rights (such as sending a child to a football class to learn to play an instrument) are disrespectful of the child's personality.
Because the child who is not respected for his identity and existence loses the freedom to be himself, the defense mechanism triggers the feeling of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance", says psychologist Hilal Arslan, "and by hating, the child is trying to tell himself and others that he is valuable, that he does not accept what is done to him".
"Hate here is 'I am here,' and it serves the purpose of maintaining the child's self-respect", says the psychologist, who says that the child's refusal to acknowledge the situation and responding in this way is a positive development in his personality.
"If the child is allowed to be an individual, hate will disappear", he says.
The child tries to protect himself by resorting to anger and hatred
Arslan said that at a young age, when children are physically and spiritually most vulnerable, parents can experience negative emotions in the child, because of verbal and emotional violence by the environment.
"Sometimes it is not just the emotional needs (no stroking, no hugs, no school or other needs) that are not being met", continues Arslan, "sometimes it is the physical needs (e.g., food, drink, shelter, school supplies, etc.) that are not being met".
It's a nurturing attitude that allows for anger rather than hatred.
Emotional and verbal violence include such behaviors as insulting, insulting, belittling, scolding, unnecessary and severe punishment, feeling unworthy, and shouting.
Such behavior is deeply affecting because it is directed toward the child's personality.
"The child either accepts them and loses self-respect and spends his life struggling with feelings of worthlessness, unloveliness, and inadequacy, or he tries to protect himself by resorting to anger and hatred".
