Welsh Government Councillors (AMs) concern about looking like an idiot
There is some concern amongst the Council of State over the suggestion that the name of their office should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The motion came in response to the proposed change of name to the Welsh Parliament.
State legislators of all political parties are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that  sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means foolishness and pwp means foolishness.
A Plaid member said that the whole party was "disgusted" and suggested alternatives.
One Welsh Conservative said his party "wanted more information about the name change, but said it was a shortcut to the transition in speech from MWP to the word Prostitution.
In this case the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which drafted the bill for the name change, stated: "The final vote on all nominations for members of the Legislative Council shall be by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name of the Court.
In May, the Department published a public inquiry into a popular demand for a Welsh Parliament.
Because of the position's name of AMs, the Party chose the name Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP's identity was strongly supported in public opinion polls.
The AM is currently seeking alternate names, but the difficulty of reaching a settlement may be a headache for the Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to issue a legal opinion on the name change in a few weeks.
The proposed amendment would also include changes to the functioning of the council, including rules on the dismissal of the AM and the structure of the committee's work.
The AM will have a final vote on the question of what he should be called when the bill is discussed.
Macedonians had a ballot to change their country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The election was organized in an attempt to end a long - standing conflict with neighboring Greece, which has a single province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a pretense of territorial power and has long denied its membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the unpopular vote to change the name, has said that he will not support the vote.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that the name change is merely a price for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Monkeys Quiet in the Face of Harlem Congregations
"According to the mythology, the adults I spoke to said that there would be a congregation on every corner", said Adams.
"Today, none of that is available".
He said that the sound of the corn was understandable.
"People are now more aggressive", he says.
"We are no longer the resort people go to all the time".
But for the congregations, they are concerned that the money from the sale of the items will not be as much as the leaders expected, "but will quickly be returned to the original place".
He added that congregations could be replaced by housing for people who have not yet helped to make such areas peaceful.
"Most of the people who will buy rooms in these facilities will be white", they said, "which will bring the closing date forward because it may not happen that all those who enter these rooms become members of these congregations".
All were established by white churches before the Harlem area became a black community - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first white Methodists to attend the meetings in this area left in the 1930' s.
The congregation of soldiers who met nearby took turns in the hall.
The St. Martin's congregation was led by a religious group headed by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest against the exploitation of blacks by businessmen on 125th Street, Harlem's main thoroughfare.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's students planned to rebuild it, they designed carillons.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson's successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon bells "the bells of the poor".
The carillonian musician of July-July called the instruments "the traditional instrument" and "the indispensable instrument of the ages".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, said that the first bell was struck by a world - renowned violinist, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Riverside Church grand orchestra 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that the congregation of St. Martin did not need a replacement.
The events at St. Martin during the past few months have been a harrowing story of architects and builders, some brought in by the ecclesiastical administration, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish council - called the vestry - where the church leaders meet - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "wanted to pass on the salaries" to the vestry, even though the council did not participate in hiring the diocese's architects and builders.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of honesty on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old lobster fisherman in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season, local officials said.
The accident occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends about one o'clock on Saturday morning when he heard a boy shout for help and a group of rescuers came to help him out of the water.
Hammel at first thought that perhaps catching the lobster was a pleasant experience, but then he heard the boy shout, "Hell no!
I am disgusted with you!'
The sternum is always removed", Hammel said, noting that he saw this when he was on the boy.
"I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: 'You're in the water, Shark!'" adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was placed on the critical list.
The species of shark that attacked him is not known for certain.
Rescue officer Capt. Larry Giles told the nation that the shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it did not appear to be a threat.
Giles added that the boy had severe injuries to the upper body of the spine.
Local authorities have closed the access to Ponto Beach in Casablad at Swami in Ecinitas for less than 48 hours to investigate the incident and to establish a barrier.
Giles estimates that there are 135 species of sharks in the park, but most are harmless.
Sainsbury's is entering the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's was involved in the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams oil and leather parts industry, where the workers were subjected to strict conditions.
As part of the UK's £2.8bn cosmetics market, which is growing as the fashion and home goods sector recovers, the cosmetics business will be expanded to 11 stores nationwide and will expand to more stores this year.
The money-saving oil has come so that many stores have filled the shelves of their old TVs, microwaves, and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's claims to have increased the size of cosmetics to 3,000 brands, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Other legacy stores, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees, will also feature a number of similarly labelled rooms.
The department store is also rebuilding its boutique business to cater to the growing number of non - animal - consuming customers who are seeking to appeal to teenagers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance will also test its perfume at Sainsbury's, which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, earlier this year.
Online shopping and the daily shopping for small amounts of food at local stores means that supermarkets must work harder to force people to shop at these stores.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the department stores are becoming more like a strip mall as the supermarket fights Aldi and Lidl for prices on many services and nonfood items.
Sainsbury's has been promoting the Argos brand in many stores and producing Habitat numbers since purchasing both stores two years ago, which it says has helped boost sales and boost sales.
The store's previous attempt to remove fragments of fuel and medicines failed.
Sainsbury's tried to work with Boots in early 2000, but the problem arose after a dispute over the amount of money that was being made in the store's wooden tires.
The new partnership comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281st pharmacy to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
Lloyds could play a major role in the network, he said, by adding other skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the chain's four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing manager at Sainsbury's, says: "We have changed the look and feel of the leather shops to add a touch of beauty to our customers.
We have also invested in training and counseling for regular attendants.
Our product line is designed to meet all needs and the beautiful and ubiquitous location means that we are now on the cusp of being a store that invites everyone, unlike traditional shopping".
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby leaves £11 million business
Dragons Den's Peter Jones is 'outraged' after the cartoonist Holly Willoughby quits her £11 million business and life insurance business to focus on a new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to work on Truly furniture and appliances.
The two men's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The host of This Morning, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure.
The departure of Holly Willoughby from Dragons' Den has Peter Jones angry because Holly has left the fast-moving luxury goods business - to focus on new business partnerships with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The reporter said Jones was "outraged" when a TV star admitted at a press conference Tuesday at her headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business - worth £1.5 million - meant that she had no time to resist her Truly brand of furniture and accessories.
The business was compared to the Goop estate of Gwyneth Paltrow and was estimated to be worth up to twice Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain for a holiday home in a luxury resort.
"Truly's business is at the top of Holly's list", says the speaker.
It would be his most profitable business , one that would sustain him for years to come .
His outcome is a surprise to all involved.
No one believed what happened Tuesday, which brought the market closer to opening.
There is a packed warehouse at Marlow HQ that is waiting to be sold".
The decision to leave the This Morning host, one of Britain's wealthiest citizens, could affect the store's operations, which include a wide range of items including clothing and furniture, as well as delaying the opening of the store.
It can also mean the end of a long-standing relationship.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, a father of three, have been in a relationship with Jones and Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started the Truly business with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined in March.
The two men and Jones own 40 percent of Baldwin's television commercials.
Willoughby will be the M&S marketing representative and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"We can't talk about this business deal", said a reporter who approached Jones the night before.
A strong word after we love each other
He joked about the criticism that could be made of the case and the comments that some might consider "unfit for the leader" and the strong support of the North Korean leader.
What was the reason for President Trump's removal?
Trump called his arrogant voice "like a propaganda".
"I have not lost anything".
He knew that Kim was eager to meet again after the first summit in Singapore in June, where Trump called it a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the discussion of nuclear salvation has stalled.
More than three months since the Singapore summit North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North has not seen a "sustainable response" from the U.S. to the immediate end of nuclear power in North Korea.
As I approached, they realized that the U.S. was increasing its sanctions to the point of imposing a greater tyranny.
Trump, in his speech, seemed to be very relaxed and hopeful that everything would be fine.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
"I was about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship".
He said that their efforts to establish relations with Kim have been rewarding - they have stopped testing rocket missiles, helped rescue prisoners, and brought civilian bodies back to their homeland.
They defended their unique speech about their relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but at a time when you have 10,000 people out there who need to get into this open space, you can have up to 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to supporters.
Indonesian waves and earthquakes devastate the Pacific, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was left homeless, no national emergency was declared, which could lead to the withdrawal of international aid.
"Many times, sadly, they have told my brother that they don't need any help, so it's been a tragedy", said Ms. Sumbung.
When Save Children was planning a trip to Palu, it was not clear whether foreign workers would be able to work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster management agency, said that Indonesian authorities are still assessing the extent of the disaster in Palu and whether foreign aid agencies can be allowed to join the relief effort.
Because of the frequent earthquakes that Indonesia experiences, the country is so vulnerable that it is ill-prepared to survive the ravages of nature.
Although surf breaks have been built in Aceh, they are not available in other coastal areas.
The lack of a warning bell in the area, even if the waves were present, was a major factor in the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's many islands has often proved difficult.
Natural disasters also strengthen the morale.
The Lombok hospital's emergency medical unit is on its way to Palu, but it could take three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has focused on repairing the most damaged buildings and roads in Indonesia as a means of elections, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But now the withdrawal is out of the hands of the Joko who is now heading for re-election this year.
Joko had another problem with the religious conflict in Indonesia, where many Muslims have joined in the religious service that relies on each person to do his or her job.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using swords, arrows, clubs, and other deadly weapons.
Right: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool, scoring the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri with 30 yards to go in the Chelsea box with his team leading 1-0.
He returned the ball to his left before it landed near the top of the bench.
The net was a long one and it was bent at the bottom of the net.
A short distance away, a road crosses the island, overlooking the Aristarco Kepa.
"He was always keen to get in there, to be on the ball and players like Shaq are always fighting to play forward, so I was struggling to make time for myself as much as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and was enjoying it but I didn't care and I just hit him".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute and was joined by Belgian goalkeeper Eden Hazard.
The Blue kicker kicked the ball into the net for Mateo Kovacic, before turning around the middle of the field and running to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic comes to the halfway point of the game.
He then came up with a wild goose chase, taking Hazard to the orphanage.
Hazard rushes to the top of the bench and to the left of Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will also face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian waves rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami and earthquake now stands at 832, the disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Thousands of people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings after Friday's 7.5 - magnitude quake and waves of up to 20 feet [20 m], spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the gathering.
The city of Palu, with a population of about 380,000, was flooded with waste materials from the collapsing buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, suspected of killing a woman who was stabbed to death.
An investigation is underway after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death.
Police asked people who had seen or heard anything at the scene to come forward.
'The investigation has just begun,' said Brian O'Hagan of the Criminal Investigation Service, 'and I appeal to all those in the John Street area of Birkenhead who have seen or heard anything they suspect may be in contact with us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might be able to record their cars to talk to us because they might have information that would help us in our investigation.'
A spokesman for the police department confirmed that the woman's body was found in the Birkenhead neighborhood and in the building.
In the evening, friends who knew the woman went to the scene of the accident to ask questions about the reason and where the body was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they were preparing to inform the woman's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his room but was stopped by the police, who were not permitted to enter or leave the building.
You are surprised to hear what has happened.
Residents are now being told that it may take a few hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer was heard telling one person that the whole area was now classified as a crime scene.
A woman appears there weeping.
He repeatedly said 'terrible.'
At 2pm two police officers are inside the cordon and another car outside.
Some police officers stand in the cordon and search the houses.
Anyone with information is asked to send it to @MerPolCC, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 by 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell House statue becomes a modern 'historical re-enactment'
Its ban may have been a poetic response to his Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures by his Puritan subjects.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's speech as "crazy" and "like a historical revision".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, observed: "It was beyond question in the debate over the exorcism that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster might be one of the subjects of attention.
The planning of the wars in the English territories did not begin or work with Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell could draw on the work of his grandfather Thomas a century earlier.
A complete description of Cromwell's description of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is the 19th-century historian's conviction and historical record of a man who may seem worthy of celebrating him.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen more by many, especially in the late nineteenth century than today, as the protector of the legislature from external pressures, in his view of what a monarchy might be.
If this representation is perfect, it may be a recurring theme in secular mythology.
The fact that the turmoil of the mid-17th century set the stage for the subsequent development of our country is a well-known fact, and Cromwell is a notable representative of one side of this division.
His glorious work as the Lord's Protector is also worthy of praise and honor".
A Harsh Pig Bites a Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a rural village in northern China, according to local media.
The man, known by the nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured heart, covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer plans to inject his pigs on the farm on November 30-May, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly took his brother-in-law from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell his 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her brother-in-law found her dead, and the door to the next door was unlocked.
He said that the very pig in the bowl had been infected with blood.
An autopsy found that the same 550-pound pig bit the farmer and killed him, according to the records.
"My brother-in-law's legs were bloody and broken", said his cousin "Wu", according to the Evening News of Guiyang.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed this man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The superintendent of the market told the Evening News that the pig was selected to prevent any attack, while the police were investigating the facts.
Yuan's family and the village officials had a frank discussion about his death.
Although rare, cases of gang violence have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a husband and wife on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove him away.
After a pig farmer in Oregon was removed from his farm in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally safe, but blood-borne scents can be "dangerous"
"Pigs often have a tendency to be loud.
They have youthful wisdom, exploration.... and no violence.
But you deserve the honor you deserve", they said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rains to the western US
According to meteorologists, Rosa is weakening as it sweeps through the northern part of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring heavy flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 85 mph, as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and was moving about 385 miles [385 km] west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
By now, clouds are beginning to rise over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward near the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a heavy downpour, it will begin to push a gentle northward wind toward the U.S. West Coast.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches [10 cm] of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Later, moist winds combined with the approaching clouds will bring heavy rains to the nearby Western area in the coming days.
In this area, between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall will bring hail, rocks, and possibly earthquakes in the plains.
The steady humidity in the area will bring rainfall of up to two to three inches, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to two to four inches of rain is expected in many parts of the Northeast, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Floods may be related to weather patterns caused by the spread of heavy rain.
It would be a terrible mistake to walk through the desert in the face of such a terrible storm.
Heavy rains can turn valley streams into torrential rivers and winds can create violent storms with heavy dust.
The approaching clouds brought rain to parts of Southern California.
A total rainfall of up to half an inch can occur, which can lead to garbage and road pollution.
This may be the first rainfall of their season.
The spread of rain will begin to move toward Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the spread of rain on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall is expected to spread across the four quarters on Tuesday and into Wednesday.
The U.S. is in the midst of a hot summer, with the Arctic being cooler than the tropics.
Sometimes this results in a change of distance.
A variation in the weather forecast for the central U.S. on Sunday is provided.
There is a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will begin to build up and increase again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to begin the summer with highs of 80 degrees from the South to the East.
New York City is likely to experience a temperature of 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit [80° C.] in the summer.
Long - term forecasts indicate extreme heat in the eastern U.S. during the first half of the month of May.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched the truthful testimony on six national television networks, including Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of attempted rape in the 1980' s.
Meanwhile, the political news cycle continues, as the news organizations disrupt their programs to cover the Friday news flash: the Arozona Sen. Jeff Flake is preparing to represent the FBI to set aside a week to investigate the case.
Ford's mother told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was grabbed by the waistbands while drunk and tried to undress him at a school funeral.
Kavanaugh, in his own honest testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
According to estimates, over 20.4 million people watched the trial on Friday, according to Nilesen's estimates
The company has counted the ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Their ratings were not immediately known from other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen sometimes has trouble accurately counting the number of people in their offices.
To put it more plainly, this figure can be compared to the number of people watching a football match in a stadium or attending an Education Awards ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose ratings are strongly in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, surpassed the peak of 5.69 million during the entire trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The story's follow-up is just above and beyond the judgment.
Flake was closely followed in the Thursday talk.
After the Republican chief of staff announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras early Friday morning being chased by an angry mob as he climbed onto the bench for the Judiciary Committee hearing.
She stood, shyly, as the news on CNN told her what had happened.
"I stand here before you", said one of the women.
"Do you think he is telling the world the truth?
She was told, "You are the weakest of the weak".
Flake said that his office had already communicated with the agency about the case, before the case was closed, that they had more to say to the agency after the trial.
All the radio and cable networks broadcast the events until the next hour and a half, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to bring Kavanaugh's election to the Senate general election.
But Flake said he was doing so with the understanding that the FBI would look into the election's speculation next week, something that a small number of Democrats deny.
Flake was only partially convinced by his conversation with fellow Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and other senators, Flake made a proposal.
Flake's candidacy is strong because it means that Republicans cannot win a vote for Kavanaugh without a referendum.
President Trump has denied the FBI's investigation of all allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May suspects critics of her 'political meddling' in Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politically manipulating" Britain's efforts to destroy the economy and the church, according to the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview close to the paper's front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked May's so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the idea of Britain and the EU having to raise taxes "has not been considered".
Wayde Sims's arrest: Police arrest suspected in the death of LSU dean
Police have arrested a suspect in the assault and murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball coach.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in the camp for second-degree murder, reports the Baton Rouge Police Department
The police officer showed Sims and Simpson a video of the fight, and he alleged that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police seized the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, according to WAFB for CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that he had confessed to the brutal beating of Sims.
His estate was valued at $350,000, said the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued preliminary reports Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents for their assistance in the arrest of the man.
LSU president Joe Alleva commends the local law enforcement for "their hard work and their commitment to justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-foot-long boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where Wayne's father, also a basketball player, played for LSU.
The boy weighed 5.6 pounds and saved 2.6 pounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU head coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply saddened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
Wade said, "You're always worried about that".
A volcano spreads ash in Mexico City
Smoke from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the eruption of the volcano's inner volcano increased its emissions by 183 times 24 hours.
This section measures the frequency of earthquakes.
Some photos showed cars ashes on the windows in some Mexican areas, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have been reporting an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September, 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", first erupted in 1994.
Police clash with Catalan rebels just before the celebration of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, and many were caught in a riot at the start of a secessionist referendum in Catalonia.
A mob of rebels with batons in front of the guarded police were cutting eggs and painting the walls, creating dust clouds in the streets where tourists should be found.
The fighting broke out at times during the day and the police used their batons to fight the fighting.
In the hours that followed, the independence movement shouted "No forget, no forgive" while the Unionists shouted "Spanish for life".
Fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries in the blasts, local radio reported.
It is a scary place in the heart of the independence movement, one year after the July 1 referendum that was seen as illegal in Madrid but celebrated by the Catalan revolution.
Most voters voted for independence, although those who did not vote were too few to vote against it.
According to Catalan authorities, up to 1,000 people were injured this year after police tried to stop the reopening of polling stations throughout the region, which was plagued by violence.
Independence groups camped outside on Friday to protest in support of the national police.
The people complained but were forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence protests with his wife, said that he had no hope of ever seeing Catalonia become independent.
"Last year we had a very peaceful time.
I saw my parents weep for the opportunity to choose and now we are oppressed", she said.
Despite a lasting victory in the December elections, Catalan independence activists are fighting hard for power this year as some of their powerful leaders remain in hiding and others are in prison awaiting punishment for their actions in preparation for the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records protests on her phone, said that the protests were supported by politicians on both sides.
"But the word of God spread widely".
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who was jailed without trial last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Participation in European elections is a great way to reject the regression to the political and repressive elements that characterise Spanish politics", they said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car crashed into a house several times in Londonderry.
The accident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the doorway and the house itself.
The arrow seems to have been fired at the car for some time.
A blood bag gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
The first boxing match for Dolly Menga's Livingston team was a victory
The aforementioned Livingston team knocked out Rangers manager Steven Gerrard in two defeats in an 18-game stretch as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's costume made a difference when Gary Holt's character joined the Hibernia in the second episode.
Gerrard's side went without a win in the next Premiership game against the top eight Hearts on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, are following up their victory in the division with six games under head coach Holt, who has not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's team was dividing the odds of winning by receiving strong teams
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead even before they scored a goal, and their determination would have made the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson went through the half but came back empty-handed when he took the ball, while Alan Lithgow came in on his own after scoring and hitting the head of Craig Halkett who he hit to match the ball.
The owners of the stadium were very confident in letting Ranger play in front of them, hoping to win the visitors at the right time.
In this way, they were exposed to the danger of a catastrophe.
The Rangers made a puck and Livingston worked on the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to prepare Menga, who caught the ball and hit it from the middle of the box.
This time, the Rangers had the ball but found the backs strong and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was well prepared,
This kind of play has led to a second series, although Alfredo Morelos has forced Kelly to save the ball.
Scott Pittman was dismissed for a duck by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow came to replace the ball from another ball made by Livingston.
The ball went on to the Livingston area but was all over again, and two points - after Halkett's attack on replacement Glenn Middleton, and one catch - were scored.
A 'surprise' for the Livingston group - a review from
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing play and amazing victory for Livingston's team.
Each one of them has made a better purification, going beyond the hope that he received in this heavenly calling.
Their form remained unchanged after their return, but credit goes to Holt for the way he has guided the team since joining the team.
He has many good players.
Captain Halkett worked hard, perfecting the gun's barrel, and Menga had Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall focus on the guns for the rest of the gun's time.
The Rangers, however, are in a bad mood.
Although he had some success under Gerrard, he had not reached those standards.
Their last game was a no - go - and they must have missed the Rangers, who were now in the middle of the points table.
Erdogan receives a warm welcome in Cologne
There were cheerful smiles on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's difficult tour of Germany - one that focused on improving relations between NATO members.
They have withdrawn for reasons including human rights, freedom of speech and Turkey's continued membership of the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a large mosque.
It is the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
Police said that security measures prevented a crowd of up to 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque but that many supporters stood at a distance to see their leader.
Many Erdogan's opponents - including some Kurds - have also spoken out, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's willingness to accept him.
This public outcry created a prejudice against a visitor who was admired by German Turks and denounced by others as a tyrant.
Deptford traffic accident: A bicycle rider dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist dies after a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, east of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and paramedics tried to resuscitate him, but he died on the spot.
The accident came just months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the authorities were investigating the identity of the man so that they could inform his relatives.
Road closures and road changes are taking place and motorists are being advised not to cross the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six soldiers injured in a riot
Prison guards were injured in the riot in the men's main prison, the Prison Office said.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The "Tornado" soldiers were called to the scene of the riot, which involved eight prisoners and spread to one side of the prison.
The soldiers are suffering minor wounds right there in the prison.
A Prison Guard spokesman said: "Specialised troops were sent to observe the situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six soldiers were wounded.
We tolerate no disturbance in our prisons, and those found in violation of this law can be brought to the police and face additional years in prison.
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
During the month of High Priest it was reported that the warden of the prison was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in the summer of that year, the troops of the distillery were called to the distillery where the workers were beaten with pool balls.
Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City and Floods (Wherever Areas Can Benefit)
Tropical storms are unlikely to hit Arizona, but they do in the coming week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the Desert Southwest, where they bring torrential rains.
The National Weather Service issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southeastern Nevada, central California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The storm was expected to make landfall in Phoenix on Tuesday, and it would continue through Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that since 1950 there have been 10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a storm within a 40-mile radius of the AZ border".
The National Hurricane Center's latest forecast is for rainfall of between two and four inches, and in some areas up to six inches, in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest, including the area between the Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive between one and two inches [1.8 and 2.8 cm] of rain, with some areas receiving up to four inches [4.5 cm].
For those outside the flood zone, Rosa's rainfall can be a blessing because of the area's drought-prone climate.
Although the drought is a serious concern, some of this rainfall will be a boon in some areas because the Midwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second-worst drought in history", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is heading toward the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 knots [85 m/ h], is moving 385 knots [385 m] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 knots [12 m/ h] north.
This precipitation is being absorbed by the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to sink.
So, heavy rainfall with tropical rains is expected in Mexico during the Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be extremely heavy, causing a heatwave.
"Total rainfall of between three and six inches is expected from Baja California to eastern Sonora, with occasional rainfall of up to 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move southward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, which will pass through Arizona and enter southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", says the National Hurricane Center.
The storm is expected to bring severe flooding, mudslides in the desert, and landslides in rural areas.
Midsomer Norton Massacre: Four arrested for attempted murder
Two teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was taken to hospital where he is currently in critical condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The police have asked anyone with access to photographic recordings to come and help.
Trump called Kavanaugh "the victim of the persecution, the wrath, and the anger of the Democratic Party"
"Voting for Kavanaugh is a vote for nonviolence and the misguided ways of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been the victim of the persecution, the persecution, and the anger of the Democratic Party throughout his elected career.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcing him to deny Christine Blasey Ford's suspicion that she had been sexually abused as a child.
Ford also testified in this trial on the basis of his own testimony.
The President said Saturday that "the American people saw the strength, the wisdom, and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a confirmation of the most brilliant man of our time, a judge who has a reputation for serving the public good", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred to Kavanaugh's election as a reference to the Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"There are five weeks left until the biggest election of our time.
I am not running for election, but I am running for justice".
"So I have been able to go to many places to support those who are in positions of authority".
Trump said that Democrats were on a "serious, counterproductive" mission.
The first major Senate vote on Kavanaugh's election is expected before Friday, a senior GOP supporter told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by the earthquake, the Indonesian tsunami, and the death toll is still rising.
Up to 384 people died, others were swept away by the waves that swept ashore, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said in Hebrew.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in Palu on Friday when waves as high as six feet (18 m) came crashing onto the shore in the late afternoon, taking many people to their own beaches and destroying everything in sight.
These waves were followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the wave was heard yesterday, people were doing their jobs on the beach and they didn't leave immediately and they were attacked", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster management agency BNPB, told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami waves did not come alone, they swept away cars, poles, houses, and hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that the waves were traveling at speeds of up to 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching land.
Others climbed trees to escape the storm and were saved.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the disaster watch department showed many buildings and shops burning, beds crumbling and mosque surrounded by water.
A series of minor earthquakes followed on Saturday.
The tremors were felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the earthquake on Friday carried 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
They said that the construction of the city, which was located on the edge of the island, caused the waves to rise.
Nugroho described the destruction as "massive" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, hotels and hotels were burned.
The bodies were found lying in the rubble, and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho estimated that the number of casualties and damage could increase along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area known as Donggala, near the epicentre.
The conversation "was all confused without any real conversation" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in that area", said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to the disaster area.
"This is a terrible catastrophe, and it could get worse", they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for failing to disclose the tsunami's impact on the Palu area, even though officials said the waves arrived in time after the tsunami was declared.
A video broadcast on social media showed a man shouting from a building warning people on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a tidal wave comes ashore and carries away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not confirm the video at the time.
The earthquake and the waves caused power outages and destroyed communications around Palu, leaving local authorities unable to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic items.
The city's airport, which has been closed for relief purposes, will remain closed until October.
Emperor Joko Widodo is due to visit the Palu survivors' center on Sunday.
The Indonesian Tsunami Killed Over 800 People.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision's Donggala team made it safely to Palu, where they were seated in tarpaulin bags in the courtyard of their office, they passed through a spectacularly devastated area, Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed, that's what they said.
It is a terrible thing.
Although relief teams appeared to be preparing for disaster relief, some complained that skilled relief workers from abroad were being prevented from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign funds, supplies, and personnel can only be transferred to the area once it has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a provincial tragedy", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Whenever the government says, 'OK, this is a global disaster,' we can send in aid from other countries but it has not yet happened".
As the second day of the earthquake and tsunami strike Palu on Friday, the friends and family of the victims still hope that their loved ones can be like miracles that soothe the heart after this terrible disaster.

On Sunday, rescuers arrived to rescue the woman who had been lying on the rocks for two days with her body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, recalled two of the missing from the Asian Games, which ended last month in Indonesia.
Some of those detained at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were her disciples
"As a paragliding instructor, I have a heavy burden on my heart", he says.
Gendon explained how the crowd, after hearing about the Roa Roa Hotel collapse and the news spread among the participants, began sending WhatsApp messages to their rivals in Palu, who were participating in the riverfront celebration.
Sadly, their news was more than a blur, without the two blue lines.
"I think that means that these things haven't happened yet, that's what they said.
A bank robber withdraws $26,750 at an ATM at Newport, Levee
The thieves on Friday stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was depositing money at an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was pulling money from the ATM at the casino and preparing to take the rest, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy.
While he was in the process of being evicted, another "came running from behind the Brink's clerk" and stole a basket of money that was to be distributed.
Witnesses said they saw the suspects start to leave the scene, along the street, but police were unable to determine the exact number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has a copy of this account can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The singer changes his name to Ye
Singer Kanye West is changing his name - Ye.
"The man who once was Kanye West", he wrote on Twitter on Saturday.
West, 41, has been given the nickname Ye at one point and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album called Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who left due to the some-mindedness expressed by the show's creators.
Along with the abbreviation of his name in his current use of the term, West later said that the word had a religious connotation to him.
"I believe that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means iwe", West said in a discussion of his new album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, I am we.
It is from grace, which means to go to Him alone, which reveals our good, our bad, our faults, everything.
This shell says a lot about who we are".
He is one of the most famous musicians to change their name.
Sean Combs is popularly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferred names Love and Brother Love.
Another collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, also occasionally removes the spelling of his name and writes his name in lower case.
Mexican AMLO officials promise not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's new president, Andre Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to stop the use of military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never again use the military to oppress Mexicans.
Military rioters routed peaceful protesters in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as student protests began to form in America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican youths by funding their education and by opening new universities.
They say that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are the main reasons why young people join gangs.
The U.S. should increase the A.I.
As China becomes more active in human resources, the U.S. should increase its spending on research, said AI entrepreneur and entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee, a former Google, Microsoft, and Apple executive.
This statement comes at a time when many U.S. government departments are making announcements about AI, even though the U.S. does not seem to have a full-fledged AI agenda.
At the same time, China launched its own initiative this year: it aims to become the number one AI player by 2030.
Increasing funding for AI research could be a good start, especially at a time when most countries are falling behind the U.S., and we are looking at further AI success", said Lee.
Increasing spending could increase the chance that the next major AI success will be in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a major investor in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI system that brought the American scientist Othello to the world, and later he went to work at Microsoft Research and then as a Google executive in China.
Lee discussed past U.S. technology projects such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked where the next project should be, in order to identify people with expertise in the field.
Researchers in the U.S. have had to work hard to win government funding, Lee said.
"It is not China that recruits academics; it is institutions", said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have over the years compared hundreds of thousands of university employees to AI.
Lee said that a change in traffic laws could also help the U.S. to eliminate its own AI-based services.
"I think green cards should be given to those who have PhDs in AI", he said.
The State Council of China has announced the country's Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China provides grants to the academic community in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide grants to U.S. researchers, but the impact of these grants is limited in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is responsible for bringing together personnel from the operations and training departments, and the White House also announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DAPRA announced $2 billion in investments in a project called AI Next.
But on the NSF side, it now generates $100 million a year in AI research.
On the other hand, the U.S. legislation that would have created the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been ineffective in recent months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would end years of negotiations with Greece that have blocked their bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has called the name of the neighboring island "Left" to represent a part of its territory and has opposed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two countries reached an agreement in June on the new name, but nationalist critics said that the change would confuse the Slavic identity of Macedonia's majority.
President Gjoege Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that refusing to lend votes would raise doubts about whether voters would reach the 50 percent threshold needed for a referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper read: "Do you want membership in NATO and the EU and the acceptance of Greece's consent?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a fair price to pay for Macedonia, a breakaway country from Yugoslavia, to join the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the national goal, that the Macedonian people can live in freedom within the European Union because it means a better life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not all were affected, many lawmakers said they would accept the results of the election in order to make the election more effective.
A name change requires a majority of the members of the legislature, at least three times.
The national election commission said that no problems were found in the polls at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was down 16 percent from the 2016 parliamentary election, which was 34 percent with 66 percent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the way for them to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing stands and seating in front of tents set up by those who wanted to avoid taking part in the referendum.
"We want to be in NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with open heads, not in ignorance", said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country but we are important.
If they don't want to do it like Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and join the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed progress to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I hope that many people are supporting us because up to 80 percent of our people are in favor of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
They said that the "yes" vote would be a confirmation of our goal".
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research estimates that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - a figure that is below the required level.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
A referendum requires at least 50 percent of the votes cast and one vote.
The failure to pass the referendum would represent the biggest legal challenge to the Eastern bloc since it came to power in November of this year.
In the foreground: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through Brighton's barricade with a boot
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling weakened the defence of Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easier when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran the ball through two Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Now Agur was surrounded by four men dressed in robes.
He circled one guard before rushing to leave the others at the end of the Brigthton box.
He now moves to the left, and finds Sterling.
The English forward used the first ball in the box to return the ball to Aguero who used his right foot to beat the Brighton keeper and get the ball into the right of the net.
"Aguero was struggling with a problem in his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about it because he was playing for 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We were fortunate that he had his boots on at the right time".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first chance at promotion to the Premier League.
The attack came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the middle of the field in that game.
He sent a good ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few trips and led Sterling to the end of the bench.
The forward of the Sky Blues kicked the ball into the net just before he left the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wanted to play against the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the wild card round, there was no longer any reason to start over.
But all-time champion Scherzer is hoping to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only with the restrictions of a hard-fought playoff against the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies are playing to win with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night and want to try their best to stay on top of their game.
"Even though we're playing with nothing, we can still walk away with the pride of knowing that the sights here in Denver and the crowds and the teams will be playing at the highest altitude I'll ever reach this year.
Why should I not compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their Sunday start, but they have been told that they want to allow Scherzer to pick the venue for this time.
Scherzer, who is making his 34th start, will be selecting the bench on Thursday and the field on Sunday during the regular break.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
The Trump summit in West Virginia
The President was referring to a recent Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's report on the Republican majority in his midterm elections.
"All our efforts could be ruined in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not standing in elections but one that I stand for why I'm everywhere fighting for those who stand strong, he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group, the evil Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
They will use every means to gain power, and they will use violence, malice, and self-righteousness to do so.
They don't care who they hurt, who they trample on to be powerful and to rule, what they want to be power and to reign, we will not give them".
Trump said that Democrats were on a difficult task "to counter and balance".
"Then you can see what has happened in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and violent, disrespectful and lying".
He also cited a Senate Judiciary Committee statement naming Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, which caused a lot of noise from the crowd.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you distribute the pamphlet without authorization?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for something - there was body language - the most horrible body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a major party
It does not allow those who express their opinions to speak their minds
When Momentum supporters in my party voted to keep me in the party, it was no surprise.
I am one of the senior executives of the department who was told to be unwelcome - just for expressing our views.
My lawyer friend Joan Ryan was also subjected to harsh treatment for refusing to engage in religious activities.
For my part, the issue of my candidacy was related to my refusal to endorse Jeremy Corbyn.
On the richness of economic law that can be applied, on national security, similar issues that Jeremy also refused to acknowledge with the conservative leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we want the meeting to be inclusive and progressive.
For most of the eight years I've been a Labour MP, the GC meetings on Thursdays have always been the same.
Unfortunately, today, it is not happening in many rallies and the promise of a humble, gentle political system is forgotten if, in fact, it is started.
It is now common knowledge that different motions are not allowed in the Labour Party and each motion is judged on whether it is accepted or rejected by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues who had experienced the same sorrow in the past expected me to quickly change and accept the way I had never thought to - whether it was national security or a single EU member.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter how I speak - there are hard-hitting slogans that I should be voted out, that I should be voted out of office, that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not alone in this.
I know I am inferior to some of my fellow workers, for I have been accused of being a political prisoner.
I am amazed at the work and perseverance of my fellow workers who are daily under the pressure of their own pressures and trials and yet do not tire out.
The sad thing about politics today is that the oppressor seems to be allowed to do so.
Jeremy Corbyn this week said the Labour Party should have a more tolerant approach.
The fact is, we are no longer as large a church as we once were, and whenever there are laws of disloyalty, the party is getting smaller.
I have received many encouragements over the past two years to keep my head down, to keep quiet and "get better".
But that was not my approach to politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student under the Thatcher government and the last to bring my school to the brink of collapse, I have been determined to work hard and give good things to citizens in need - even if only as a chancellor or a government official.
I have never shunned my political representation, especially in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused by my verses and by some of the things I say about the current administration.
To those who supported this statement on Friday, all I can say is that as the world is headed for a Brexit that will disrupt so many lives, businesses and our services to citizens, I do not understand this waste of time and energy in my commitment to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency, whether Labour or not: I am willing to serve you and I promise that no political or political words will prevent me from doing what I believe is right.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the undefeated Ayrs ascend
A two-Test delay would have confused the final, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this very exciting game of the day in the Tennent Premiership.
They are now in heaven, the only undefeated army in existence.
In the end it was their defensive part of the game, combined with their luck, that led to the win and their coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We are tested in our bodies and not defeated, I should rejoice.
"The credit goes to Ayr, who has used his opportunities better than we have", says Robyn Christie of Melrose.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card given to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was cleared by the Warriors to play, gave Melrose the score and Jason Baggot took the unsuccessful penalty attempt to enter.
He probably added to Ayr's play by hitting a penalty, then, during the break, he came in and then insulted himself and put on his own jersey to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose has a good start to the second half with Patrick Anderson, who is backed by Baggot, reducing the gap to five.
There was a long wait for Ruaridh Knott, who was injured and was ruled out, and when they restarted, Ayr went forward through a shot that hit Stafford McDowall, and was sent back to Spring.
The substitute captain is Ayr, Blair Macpherson is now given a yellow card, Melrose has tried hard to score but a ball from Bruce Colvine is not allowed to enter, at the end of a fierce argument
The owners of the stadium came in with a bang, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for an unbanned Climo attack from the penalty spot, MacPherson came in and dropped the ball behind Ayr, who followed him.
He may have also been in, as he has been for most of the rest of the game, after Kyle Rowe came to catch David Armstrong in the box and hit Gregor Henry in the fifth inning of the same game.
The player in the Still Game appears ready to take on a new career in the food industry
Still Game actor Ford Kieran appeared poised to enter the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he had been chosen as the president of the company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC drama, which he writes and stars in with longtime friend Greg Hemphill.
The two sources said that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to air, and that Kiernan was apparently preparing for his life after Craiglang.
According to the employer's schedule, he is the president of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has refused to comment on the matter, although some in the Scottish Sun have suggested that Kiernan is trying to enter the fast-food business that is booming in Glasgow".
'We are our own sea': borderland Bolivia hopes to open up the Pacific
Pirates were passing through the main port of La Paz.
All the buildings of the world will be flown with blue sea flags.
A sign at the ferry crossing from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon says: "We are our own seafarers.
It is our job to have him".
All over Bolivia, memories of the 19th-century coastline that Chile lost in bloody accidents are still alive - as is the renewed interest in the Pacific.
This hope has been growing over the past decade, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of strength, unity, and patience, as well as a lot of optimism", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on the world's major powers, hoping that the Hague tribunal will show its sympathy for Bolivia's demand that - after decades - Chile agree to negotiate a sea route for Bolivia.
Bolivia's religious leader Evo Morales - who is running for reelection this year - has strong support in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", they vowed at the end of November.
But some analysts say that another court may not rule in favor of Bolivia - and that it will do little to change that.
The UN in the Netherlands had no authority to grant asylum to Chileans, and it would not decide the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision comes shortly after the final hearing has made the case unfounded, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean geologist.
And the recovery of the Bolivian people, four years ago, seems to have pushed it back.
"The issue of access to the sea is a matter of concern to the Bolivian authorities", said Zárate.
The dictator Morales has finally stripped Chile of all its good qualities, they say.
Bolivia and Chile may at some point be in a dialogue, but it will be very difficult to continue the dialogue after that.
The two countries have not held diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, denies that the court's ruling was often too hasty.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of economic discord", they said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales - one of Latin America's most prominent dictators - used the sea-level story as a pretext for political propaganda.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean", they added.
"Judgment can be an opportunity to overcome the past".
North Korea says it will not get rid of its nuclear weapons unless the U.S. gives it the confidence to do so
North Korea's foreign affairs chief, Ri Yong Ho, has said that his country will not withdraw its nuclear energy from the first place unless it trusts Washington.
Ri made the remarks Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
They have called on the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore summit of rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to begin a serious nuclear negotiation three months after Singapore's talks with North Korea's Kim Jong Un were suspended.
Ri called it "a dream come true" that continued U.S. sanctions and a delay in ending the Korean War would cause the North to collapse.
Washington is concerned about the approval of Pyongyang's first-ever nuclear power plant.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second summit.
But there are doubts that Pyongyang would be willing to give in to what it sees as its only defense .
Pompeo was preparing to visit Pyongyang for the second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases the latest high fashion trends coming to the High Street near you
If you want to add a thickness to your helmet or sunscreen, don't go far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled the stylish hats at the SS19 roadside attraction that captivated the Paris Fashion Week.
The most beautiful hats that appeared on Instagram this summer were also sent by the designers to the most beautiful places and streets.
Valentino's most beautiful crown was a large, brightly colored crown with a sash-like end that neatly covered the top of the dress.
Other large items included a water-resistant cap, a magic crown, and a statue - but these were not designed to provide warmth to the head.
Thom Browne also unveils the eyeballs - just before Halloween.
Many of the eyewear had a sharpened lip and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One was a form of scuba diving gear with a pipe and glass, and the other was a glass of melted ice cream.
If you hear the word about fine clothes, you are blessed.
Archaeologists say that these giant crowns are now moving and reaching the streets near you.
Large hats are ideal for wearing on 'La Bomba' shoes, and a double-edged grass hat is seen on many heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Another attractive addition to the crown was a spinning top and a second piece of cloth - a grass-collar shaped like the crown that symbolized the wearer.
The orange-orange raiffia, with its curved stripes and white leather collar, was popular in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
This is how fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and women's pants on the road next summer - when the designer is so popular that it will be difficult to break the cycle of big products.'
John Edward: Language is a global asset
Scottish schools have continued to be at the top of the academic performance charts, with another great success in 2018, which has been driven by individual commitment and collaboration in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With a student population of some 30,000 in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are struggling to provide quality education and services to students and parents.
Self-serving schools aim to prepare students for higher education, career advancement, and a place as citizens of the world.
As a department of education that can design and implement a comprehensive curriculum, we see the growth and demand for new languages as curricula in our schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language you can understand, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart".
This is a good reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build trust and confidence with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking of the best grades in private schools.
Up to 68 percent of students in foreign language studies have successfully completed the Upper A-level of Gilead.
The report, drawn from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students had achieved the Higher A grade in Mandarin, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that the Scottish public schools are promoting foreign languages as a resource for the future needs of children and adolescents.
Languages, as a subject of choice, are now included in the same way as science or STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private and public schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of job vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
Language proficiency is thus essential in preparing youths for their future careers.
At a time when many jobs require language skills, this culture will flourish in a world of cooperation.
It does not matter what one chooses, if one has learned the second language, one will have the opportunity to do so permanently in the future.
Being able to communicate with people of other nationalities will give a multilingual person an advantage over others.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 UK adults, 75% were unable to communicate effectively in a foreign language, with French being the second language spoken by over 15 percent of the population.
This is why it is so important to invest in language education for today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially in developing countries, will open up opportunities for children to find meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will have a different language curriculum.
Some schools will focus on new languages, while others will teach languages that are likely to be a major part of the UK's economy in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, there will be a wide variety of languages to choose from in the schools that cater to them, with teachers trained in this area.
Scottish private schools are committed to creating an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to move forward, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied that in the present, globalized world, nations are becoming increasingly rich for the sake of the world, and this must be seen in the study.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed "as a global medium of communication".
Independent schools will continue to provide this, increasing the diversity of ethnic groups and improving the education of young people in Scotland.
We must work hard.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening game of Sunday's game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the exact date of the final has not yet been announced.
"It can be more than a minute and less than 48 minutes", Wallton said on the Lakers' website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James appeared to have played the right minutes.
Following the game this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a game at this stage of my career to be ready", he replied.
The Trump Summit in West Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump is opening his upcoming election rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is one of five events Trump has planned for the coming week, including shopping centers in populated areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation of the vote pending for the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing House leadership in the November elections.
What time is the Trump conference in West Virginia tonight and how do you get started online?
The time for the Trump Summit in West Virginia is set for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia on YouTube via a live stream.
Trump is expected to speak at this week's Supreme Court hearing in the case of Brett Kavanaugh, a tough case over the alleged rape of a pregnant woman while the controversial confirmation vote is suspended until next week while the FBI investigates.
But the intense activity of the whole convention helps Republicans to prepare well for the upcoming November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign for five terms this week focused on "empowering the moderate and Republican supporters to try to defend and expand their seats in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congressional leadership is so constrained that it is necessary for presidents to travel to many places as we enter a busy period of voter fraud", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's convention will draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and a large audience in Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia, which won more than 40 percent of the vote in the 2016 election.
Trump was trying to support West Virginia Republican Sen. Patrick Morrisey, who lost the election.
"It is not a good idea for Morrissey to have the president come in and help him get more votes", said Simon Haeder, a professor of political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the strength of its defense by keeping the ball in play as Sunday's individual championship approaches
After three one-sided games, another 4/4 Saturday may be what the Ryder Cup needs.
The pendulum of momentum is a new sporting phenomenon that is sometimes embraced by players, and it is a major competitor in such competitions.
So where can we find the momentum now?
"They're ahead with six boats now down to four, so we're guessing that's a big increase", said Jordan Spieth, as he awoke at the end of the night.
The fact is, Europe was lucky, four points ahead with twelve games to go.
The Americans, according to Spieth, felt they had plenty of steam to carry them forward and had plenty of encouragement, including Spieth and Justin Thomas who had been out all day and had each taken three or four boats.
Spieth is the most successful in introducing the color from tee to green as an example.
The festive excitement grew as his play progressed, including a difficult match of four in each round that he and Thomas had chosen in pairs.
His victory in the 15th edition of the tournament was met with the same enthusiasm, a celebration that would have suggested that he believed the American team would never be eliminated.
"You should just sing the test and worry about your game", Spieth said.
So the crowd was divided.
18 holes to make a shell.
The only players to have more boots than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup legend.
These two European people are in chapter 4 of 4 and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only two people who couldn't afford to put in a bogey on Saturday night, but also didn't want to hit bogey on Saturday morning, Thursday night and the 9 o'clock on Friday morning.
The run, and the impressive performance from the crowd, ensures that the Sunday winners will be the most famous winners in Europe at the sunset for Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
My experience with a different watchman is one of a kind.
However, the history of Europe is still not enough.
The performance of Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made Sergio Garcia's performance look more limited, as he emerged as the morning champion, tied with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double-header in front of the ninth guard the Spaniard and the Swede in the hole they couldn't get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the pit.
Games 4 and 4 are well-known for their close relationship between the two players, the number of hands they give, the number of hands they don't give, and the rapid pace at which the game can change.
Europe has been a good team so far and were on the bottom as they entered the final day but in games 4 and 4 of the season it shows that Team USA also has the ability to attack that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe led 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe had a chance as they entered the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's fourth and fourth games with the United States 10-6 ahead.
Two different boys, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the fight to two wins over Tiger Woods, who was adding four more holes at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who were keen to repeat the trophy they had lost to Hazeltine two years earlier, led the American team in the 4 and 4 o'clock games with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. team is trying to get stronger in the fourth and fourth games, winning two games, but failing to make the cut.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight of the 12 Sunday games to repeat the cup.
Fleetwood became the first rookie in European competition to win four consecutive titles when he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the weekend's strong showing, managed to score four in four straight games since the Ryder Cup began.
After defeating Woods by Patrick Reed in the 4 and 4 rounds and defeating the weary Woods and newcomer American Bryson Dechambeau by one stroke in the 5 and 4.
Woods, who played in just two games on Saturday, has been playing well at times but has now won 19 of his 29 games in four and seven consecutive seasons.
Justin Rose, who rested in the 4 and 4 matches of the morning, returned to make up with Henrik Stenson in the 4 and 4 matches and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1- respectively world No. 1 and No. 3.
Not all Europeans were on board on that fine, westerly day in Paris.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas began to make a name for themselves in the American public eye with their two-shot debut on Saturday.
They had a 2-1 win over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in games 4 and 4 and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in games 4 and 4 after missing two open holes.
It is the second time in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has come back from a four-game losing streak to enter a one-game playoff, although Furyk's team needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After finishing second in the regular season, it looks like Sunday's game will be tough.
North Korea says 'no way' to independently release its nuclear power without trust
North Korean foreign ministers told the United Nations world body on Saturday that the sanctions strengthened the United States' national confidence and that the country could not give up its nuclear weapons in the face of the current situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "a positive course" over the past year, including halting nuclear tests, destroying a nuclear test site, and not adding nuclear weapons to its inventory.
"We have not seen any response from the U.S., however", he said.
"If there is no trust in the U.S. there will be no trust in our national security and if there is no trust there will be no way to disarm ourselves".
As Ri repeated the North's popular complaint about Washington's refusal to offer a "common" nuclear weapon that would be rewarded if North Korea took a step forward, his words sounded powerful in that he would not deny the nuclear weapons itself as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to remarks made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever meeting between the U.S. and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula and Trump pledged to provide full protection to North Korea.
North Korea is working on a solution to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for more sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. was determined to "start with nuclear disarmament" and then to increase its pressure by strengthening sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive manner, as well as rejecting "the termination of the war"," they said.
"The idea that restrictions can be a victory is just an unfulfilled dream for people who don't know us well.
But the problem is that the extension of the ban only adds to our distrust".
Ri referred to the plans for a second Kim-Trump summit where the U.S. leader spoke about the United Nations earlier this week.
Officials cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the past five months and added: "If the main negotiators on the nuclear issue are South Korea rather than the U.S., the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula will not be as strong".
However, Ri's comments differed from those made earlier this year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea's proposed nuclear test for the U.S. was untenable after "The Evil One" Trump called Kim a "string man" on the job.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who has endorsed the "total destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his bold steps to denuclearize, but said there was much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time to prepare for the job, saying that it would "take two years, three years or five months - it's not a problem".
China and Russia have been pressing the U.N. Security Council to hold Pyongyang accountable for the unprecedented steps.
Nevertheless, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on the Truth: "The strengthening of the Security Council sanctions must continue until we have a complete, and definitive, nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has been increasing the sanctions against North Korea without restriction since 2006 in order to reduce the cost of its nuclear program.
Pompeo met with Ri during the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second session.
Pompeo has made three trips to North Korea this year, the last of which was a disappointment.
He left Pyongyang in July with the promise of a peaceful solution, but within hours North Korea denied his claims and said that he was planning "a terrorist act".
North Korea has agreed to meet Moon this month to destroy a nuclear power plant and a nuclear power plant if the United States takes "reasonable steps".
He said Kim was told that the "similar steps" he sought were the safe passage of Trump's Singapore trip and work toward improving relations with Washington.
Harvard students launch a study on rest
A new study at Harvard University this year has recommended that new students sleep more in order to reduce the "macho" reading habit of people who read "all day long" on caffeine".
One teacher found that students at a large international school spent a lot of time ignorantly studying the Bible's vital scriptures.
Charles Czeisler, an anesthesiologist at Harvard Medical School and a physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted what he called the first study of its kind in the US.
He was encouraged to start the study after discussing how sleep deprivation interferes with learning.
'At the end of their talk a girl came up and said: 'Why am I being told this so late in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him anything about the value of sleep - a surprise, he told the Telegraph.
The study, which was first launched this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep helps improve academic and athletic performance, as well as improve quality of life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chairman of the department of health at the school, said that the school decided to conduct the study after discovering that students had been sleep deprived during the week.
This one-hour study is a series of discussion sessions.
One article depicted a bedroom where students were placed on coffee tables, study and books to learn about the workings of coffee and light and how to quickly get distracted by insomnia and the need to sleep for a certain amount of time.
In another, students were taught that prolonged sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The school maps, along with the illustrations, also encourage students to reflect on their daily activities.
' we know that it will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how tobacco choice affects your health,' adds Professor Czeisler.
The arrogant trend of 'sleepless reading' still exists, they say, adding that modern-day literacy and the growing popularity of reading means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, adequate sleep must be a difficult challenge for students to overcome fatigue, fatigue and stress, they said - or even to reduce appetite, since lack of sleep causes the brain to be deprived of nutrients, leaving students feeling hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the study after studying one of his papers last year during his first year at Harvard.
She said that this study opened her eyes and encouraged her to make it a goal for all students.
The next step, they hope, will be to ask all graduates to study this type of subject before entering the highly competitive industry.
Prof. Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting a bedtime alarm, as well as waking up, and be aware of the dangers of blue light from television and LED lights, which can disrupt the human schedule, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The bloodstain knocks Gerrard's people down
The Rangers were again defeated at home when Dolly Menga's jersey stunned Steven Gerrard's disjointed team and led to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first win in their history since a 4-1 win over St. Johnsone in May, but Gary Holt's side struggled to win Gerrard's second of 18 games as captain, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
He got his boot in with seven minutes left in the half and the Rangers' weakness was unlikely to catch him.
With the Rangers now back in sixth place, Livingston has moved up to third behind Hibernian in the standings.
The Rangers also appeared to be in trouble after orphan scout Calum Spence recovered from a head wound after being hit by a long-range object.
Gerrard made eight appearances for his team as they beat Ayr to reach the semifinals of the Betfre Cup.
Holt's team, on the other hand, went with the same Liv 11 that had won Hearts a cap the previous week and were thrilled to see how their well-coordinated team pushed their opponents.
The Rangers had plenty of time to get the ball, but Livingston made the most of the catch.
They had to enter in the last two minutes when Menga's first corner sent Scott Pittman past Allan McGregor's pitch but the midfielder opened his opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' kickoff came to goalkeeper Craig Halkett but fellow defender Alan Lithgow just kicked the ball and returned it to the backseat.
The Rangers started to rebound but it seemed more hopeful than believable that they would lose in the third-to-last period
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have a peno for the quarter of an hour that he and Steven Lawless had but the bartender Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's complaint.
Rangers hit only two shots on the bench but Ibrox's previous signing Liam Kelly was unharmed with a headshot from Lassana Coulibaly and a shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Since Levi's opening in the 34th minute was against the clock, no one could doubt that the cap was deserved because of the size of the crowd.
The Rangers also lost to the rival Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not say a word when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took it with him to the easy finish.
Gerrard worked out the break when he traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch made a difference when the team captain put Morelos in but coach Kelly ran away from his orphan and went to the races.
But Livingston continued to follow the guests to the same ball game he loved, and Lithgow and Halket played long balls in succession.
Holt's team led the ball in the final but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before Lithgow hit a long head from a distance.
Rangers pitcher Glenn Middleton has another penalty kick as he faces Jacobs but Thomson again looks the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Counter
Now it says from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNT ... the day the great German scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
He invented the method of measuring radioactivity, which led to the invention of the Geiger Counter.
A mainstay of scientific research since its inception, the Geiger Counter has also become a cultural staple, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which featured some of the greatest scientists of all time, including Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is truth then?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, a device used to measure the radioactivity found in certain rocks, such as uranium.
When you put these in your ears, you can feel the atomic energy of the rock, which is made up of radioactivity".
Evans: "So you say, it was designed!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the vessel bearing his name still exists.
A new anti-cancer drug may teach the immune system to 'see' cancer cells
A new anti-cancer drug may train the immune system to 'see' cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize cancer cells as a treatment
This procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient and transplanting them into a laboratory
It can then 'see' the protein that is common in many cancers and replicate it in the body
A research drug offers hope to patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which trains the body's immune system to detect cancer cells, was amazed to see her prostate cancer shorten for more than 18 months.
This procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient, converting them into a laboratory-grade "spotting" protein called HER2, which is common in many cancers, and then re-introducing them into the body.
"Our trials are a sign of hope for a better vaccine", says Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 is "the dominant cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
The same technique of harvesting immune cells from patients and "training" them to attack cancer cells has been used in the treatment of a form of leukemia.
Kanye West begins a campaign to praise Trump for his "screaming" words, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
Failed
Kanye West was in the studio for his Saturday Night Live performance after singing a powerful song praising U.S. President Donald Trump and his candidacy for the 2020 election.
After singing her third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great t-shirt, she sang a lot of insults to Democrats and spoke out in support of Trump.
"I often talk to virgins and they say, 'How about Trump, I'll pick the middle man?'
If racism were a concern, I would have left America by now", she said.
SNL began its show with Hollywood comedian Matt Damon's sketch on Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on his alleged attempted rape as alleged by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's performance was broadcast on radio stations by entertainer Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was praising West by posting this on the media.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a problem with the headgear.
"I have been very badly treated in the past.
'Come on in the front with that dress,' they say.
How they have tormented me!
They also say I'm in a deserted area", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see the park?" and that he would "put on my victory hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Let love be the foundation of all".
His remarks caused a public outcry and the SNL audience seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the paper: "The whole studio was silent".
West was brought in late to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has surprised many by singing I Love it, dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the conservative TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "There is one among you who has a brave spirit: THANK YOU FOR STANDING BRAVE IN THIS PICTURE".
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "just showed what he is and it's great".
"But I choose NOT to sacrifice someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "card") who I know is carrying and saying things that are dangerous to my place.
He was free.
We are like that", he added.
Before the show, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "a man who used to be called Kanye West".
No musician is the first to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another singer, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion and musician Prince, changed his name to the former Prince logo.
A murder trial in Belfast's largest city
A 45-year-old man has been found guilty of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a Belfast pub on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The case is expected to be heard by the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The cases will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is furious at the stereotypes of women
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old, a big-time superhero, is furious at the selfish behavior of the macho hero, and this pornography means that boys must be jealous to get attention.
In her interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she thought something was wrong and wanted to find a way to end the violence against women in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, said that he felt that he had to 'work hard' to deal with the problem.
'I feel myself, that I must work harder, at this time - am I sorry that we have been so poor in our manly strength?' he said.
'What are we teaching men as they grow up, given the current crisis?'
Kit says that pornography is responsible for the problem of male exploitation due to the high number of male victims of violence.
He continued: 'What are we born with and what do we learn?
Does the television, the street, and the media teach boys that they must be men in order to be called men?
I think that this is one of the great questions of our time - can we change this pattern?
Because there is something wrong with boys.'
In the interview he also agreed that he would not be continuing production of a repeat or even one-off Game of Thrones when the current series ended next summer, and said that he had 'abandoned the toys and the horse fights'.
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a cartoonist and his brother who is a musician.
The actor has revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of the Game of Thrones franchise.
'I met my wife through this show, and so in this way this show gave me my family first, and my life from now on,' he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning show.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new HIV infections
China reported a 14% drop in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people were affected worldwide, according to health officials.
A record 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many abductees were rescued by violence, in contrast to the past.
In the past, HIV transmission in China was largely through blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has now been reduced to almost zero, health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan Province.
Compared with previous years, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by over 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in China, where there is a large LGBT community.
Homosexual acts were decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was reportedly severe.
Because of the secular nature of the culture and the scriptures, studies have found that 70-90% of homosexuals have come to the aid of their sexual partners.
Many of the unusual disseminations are due to the lack of adequate immunity in this society.
As early as 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide HIV vaccines to all its citizens as a way to combat the epidemic.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP senator's article is spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'suspicious stories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the suspicion that a member of her staff had posted the names of three Republican U.S. senators on the bill's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the suspicion was made up by "right-wing" political media and websites.
"Lies, lies, lies", Waters said in a tweet.
The advertisement reportedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The story appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on the alleged racial discrimination of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The story spread after three senators had finished their trial of Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState claimed that the IP address identifying the sender was leaked by Waters' office and spread the word about the employee, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated suspicion is a gross and blatant lie", said Waters.
"My servant - whose signs, myth, and cover you have confused with this deceit and false speculation - has not really spread this story.
"This is a suspect who cannot be convicted of the most heinous and vicious lie.
Waters' comments quickly became an Internet sensation, including by White House correspondent Ari Fleischer.
"This is a refusal to be angry", wrote Fleischer.
"This means that he did not feel that he was a member of the Sanctuary.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not be angry for self - defense.
He should not ask his accusers why he is standing there.
With all mildness and patience".
Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' anger with the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the Truth trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also made a comment on Twitter.
"If this is true", they tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had alerted "individuals involved and law enforcement officials to the suspected crime.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are caught", they said, "but also that they are held accountable for their destructive and dangerous activities against anyone and their servants".
A review of Johnny English Returns - a comedy play by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to share Brexit in all new episodes of the British series with the new Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would it bring a humorous critique of the story of our national plight over the privileged export of our goods?
In any case, the star-studded Johnny English has extended his second career as a stand-up comedian - a title that reflects his dedication above all else as a stand-up comedian for the non-English speaking world.
One user will play a few jokes that will amuse you by including the jokes of a small detective, in the style of Mr Bean and a variant of the one who adds a voice to the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
And he first relied on the traveling, international Atkinson man in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV series, who watched the trouble everywhere.
There are one or two positive aspects to the new JE simulation.
I was thrilled to see Johnny English take off in his old-fashioned suit, his wings slightly touching his tail.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is apparent, but sometimes comedy seems to be weakened by some over-the-top elements, especially when the "horror" genre such as 007 and Mission Impossible is present, and comedy is seen as an enhancement.
The proper entertainment seems to be aimed at younger than older people, and many of the Johnny English passes do not include any of the other good elements that occur in Atkinson's replacement for Bean.
The current year's theme is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The cybercriminal hacked into the British secret intelligence network, exposing the identities of all British diplomats scattered around the country, much to the surprise of someone on the job at the time - a small task for Kevin Eldon.
This is a very difficult situation for a proud and troubled prime minister, who suffers from a decline in her leadership and political prominence: Emma Thompson has done well in the role of quasi-Teresa-May but there is little in the way of a set of metaphors to work with.
The former were told that as soon as all the work of the spies was stopped, all those who had stopped should be brought back.
This includes the very annoying Johnny English, who now serves as the principal of a school, but who gives lectures on the subject of undercover work: interestingly, here, English teaches espionage at the School of Rock.
English is kidnapped and taken to Whitehall for a board meeting and meets his former partner Bough, a position also held by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, and is paired with the ship's captain, the famous local woman Vicki Pepperdine who seems to be very tired.
So the inevitable threat of a breakdown in Her Majesty's Secret Service is back in full force and Ophelia Bulletova is the newest successor to Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the prime minister is caught in the dangerous trap of a wealthy philanthropist who claims to solve Britain's philanthropic problems: the menace of Jason Volta, the man who has been replaced by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their imaginative journey: pretending to be a waiter, ordering a French restaurant; bringing a parrot on the flight aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English bringing a parrot while trying to use Virtual Reality headphones to get a feel for the design of Volta's home.
All the symbolism is removed so that the final act is performed, but while it is pleasant and fun in this way, the issues of the young are still in the story.
A slightly different situation.
And like many Johnny English films, I wondered: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would allow her to make the most of her talent?
The Labour Party has rejected the proposal that Britons work four days a week and receive five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is considering a plan to make the British work four days a week - with a five-day wage.
The party reportedly wants executives to take the money generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and pass it on to employees by giving them an extra day off.
This will give workers three days off on weekends - but four for the same amount of money.
Our presenters said that these plans would be appropriate in the economic and social context of the plan to change the world for the betterment of the working class.
The move to a four-day week has been advocated by the Trades Union Congress as a way to ease the burden on workers during the financial crisis.
A Labour official told the Sunday Times: 'A revision of this text was expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not be in the short term but a four-day work week with plans that are in line with the party's plans to improve the living conditions of the workers as well as plans to improve the economy.'
Labour will not be able to achieve these goals, as the Green Party also promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election.
However, this plan is not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not a party slogan and is not even in the party's mind.'
Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used this week's Labour Party conference to amplify his vision for economic and business power.
McDonnell said he was too busy harnessing power from "ambitious bosses" and "extreme lobbyists" in the public service sector.
The plans are shadow chancellors and mean that water company shareholders may not be able to recover their money fully because the Labour government may deprive them of some of the money for certain mistakes they have made.
They also support plans to train employees in corporate governance and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds by giving 10 percent of the company's equity to employees, who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds
The FBI investigation of suspected Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the delay of the final vote in his election to the Supreme Court within a week raises the question of whether the investigators' findings could dissuade Republican senators from withdrawing their support.
In a Sunday interview with "60 Minutes", reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find any evidence that would change their minds.
Kennedy also seemed to be more moderate than his fellow South Carolinians.
"I hope so", said Kennedy.
"I went to the trial, I went to the hearing with Judge Kavanaugh.
I sent him after the incident and asked him, 'Is the suspect here?'
He was courageous, firm, and uncompromising".
Graham's vote, however, seems unlikely.
"My attention is focused on the Brett Kavanaugh case and only the power of the media can confuse me", he said.
"I don't know what happened, Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett is a strong contender", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one can prove to you the things I am accusing you of.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new about the changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it made any impact on poverty reduction?
Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring a variety of musicians, in a continuation of the main mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to hear solo performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the potential of the festival to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a global movement that hopes to end poverty through the promotion of anti-poverty activism.
To qualify for a free ticket (only if you want to buy a VIP ticket), participants must complete certain tasks, or "tasks", such as volunteering, emailing a head of state, making a phone call, or doing any other activity that promotes the campaign.
But has the Global Citizen campaign achieved anything in the 12 years before it began?
Is giving people free concert tickets a similar way of forcing people to question the quality of the work or a different kind of click-and-click - people assuming that they are doing something by signing a social media message or tweeting a message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has received more than 19 million applications from supporters, calling for more projects.
He said that these efforts have helped pressure world leaders to announce commitments of up to $37 billion in funds and provisions that could help reach 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group reported 390 pledges and declarations regarding its activities, of which approximately $10 billion had been collected and distributed.
The group claims that the money raised has helped some 649 million people worldwide.
Among these promises is The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. corporate initiative dedicated to "helping young children grow to their full potential", which pledged $35 million to help Rwanda solve the country's food shortage after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Citizens of the World.
"With support from the UK government, donors, international governments, and other citizens of the planet like you, we can work to make food insecurity a global issue", The Power of Nutrition's Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a concert in London in September 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 appeals to the U.K. government to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition program, which will reach 5 million mothers and children with the help of healthy nutrition.
You answer the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on their website: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's a long and arduous process - sometimes we fail and sometimes we fail.
But like the rights and racial movements of the past, we will win, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's concert in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US government may use the Navy as a "barrier" to prevent Russian supplies from entering - Secretary of State
Washington could use its navy "if necessary" to block Russian supplies from reaching markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's relations with Syria - which he was apparently working on at the invitation of a sincere government - were a pretext for investigating the nuclear weapons program.
"I think they were in the Middle East to discuss the energy issues as they do in eastern Europe, in southern Europe", he said.
Then, according to the governor, there are ways to do it.
"The United States has the ability, through our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and if necessary, closed, to ensure that their supplies do not enter the countryside", he said.
Zinke was addressing an audience at a conference sponsored by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an organization that has called itself "the voice of the energy industry in the US.
They went on to compare Washington's dealings with Russia and Iran, saying that they were similar.
"The deal involved money for Iran and Russia, which are increasingly, or decreasingly, using the energy efficiency and substitution of oil", they said, referring to Russia as a "competitor in one thing" by relying solely on fossil fuels.
This comes at a time when the Trump administration is pushing to increase gas supplies to Europe, replacing Russia, to provide cheap supplies to European consumers.
In this regard, the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, is trying to force Germany out of the "unnecessary" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Moscow and Berlin "slave states".
Moscow has repeatedly called the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to supplement the existing 110 billion cubic meters of pipeline, a commercial development.
The Kremlin, in turn, has argued that Washington's refusal to accept the project is purely commercial and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we reject the idea that energy cannot be a weapon of war and that users should have the right to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US government's actions have drawn criticism from Germany, which has said it is committed to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the German trade federation, has urged the US government to refrain from strong EU texts and from negotiations on cooperation between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very difficult when a great power comes in and disrupts our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, executive director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will be seriously considered" for the 2020 Presidential Election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she should "consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made sure that he was considering running for office.
"It is time for our women to go to Washington and fix the broken government and what it means for women to be in the top leadership", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider running for president".
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a town hall rally, saying that he was "taking the world in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about the way Donald Trump is treating our basic human rights", he said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "we really need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Tuesday showed that many people including Warren's constituency did not think he should stand in the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of the Massachusetts "sceptical" voters said that Warren should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Up to 32 percent supported such a representation.
The poll showed a strong support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of his resignation and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names in the Democratic Party who could stand in the 2020 election for Vice President are Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would vote by January, reports Associated Press
Sarah Palin discusses PTSD by Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violent crime that occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, I can compare to other families going through the trauma of PTSD and the same trauma our soldiers are coming back with", he told a crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that the kidnapping was "like a lion in a room" and that her son and other soldiers "come back strong, come back strong, come back doubting whether there is any honor left in the surrender of their fellow soldiers, airmen, and civilians".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with rape, disruption of a traffic light and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 D.C. cities support the new vaccine
Eighteen cities and the District of Columbia supported a new U.S. law that prohibits the admission and protection of people fleeing criminal or domestic oppression.
Representatives from 18 cities and one state issued a friend-of-the-court motion Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who violates the provision, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case is Grace v. Sessions, whose complaint against the government's executive order was filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union.
She claimed that her friend "and the children of her gang members" had harassed her but that U.S. authorities had denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was buried in Texas.
The city's advocates for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as hotspots for asylum seekers from the U.S. government, as they were areas of high risk of gang violence and family violence.
The new U.S. immigration law superseded a 2014 law by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new law "deals with the urban, national, and global law of the past decades".
"Federal law requires that all claims for immunity be determined by the facts and circumstances of the claim, and that any objection is made contrary to this provision", the friend-of-the-court statement stated.
The defense also argued that the immigration ban was a disruption to U.S. commerce, and that the people could become business partners "by bringing in the necessary labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions urged immigration judges to provide shelter for those fleeing criminal repression and domestic violence during May.
"Asylum is available to those who have fled their countries because of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", said Sessions in his 11th State of the Union address.
The vaccine is not designed to solve all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
Search and rescue efforts continue in Palu as the death toll rises
For those who survived, things were not so good.
"It sounds difficult", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is laying her baby at a shelter for survivors in the devastated city of Palu.
"The ambulance is always bringing more bodies.
Clean water is missing".
The inhabitants appeared to be returning to their ruined houses, picking up some of the water-dwelling objects, trying to take whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were evacuated and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were filled.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and was paralyzed, were resting outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside because of the continuing earthquake after the quake.
Tears filled his eyes as he described what happened when the quake shook the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he lived with his wife and child.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was, I thought, stuck in the collapsed walls", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife scream, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my son.
I hope they're peaceful".
A U.S. diplomat suspects China of 'harassing' him by 'spreading the hard news'
Just a week after the Chinese newspaper published a U.S. trade report on the prospects for U.S.-China trade relations, the U.S. embassy in China organized Beijing to use American newspapers to publish a sensitive story.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a statement in the China Daily and the Des Moines Register - Iowa's largest newspaper - after he lobbied China for interference in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a question China has rejected.
Trump's Beijing campaign for the U.S. presidential election confirmed what some U.S. officials told Reuters as a new strategy by Washington to threaten China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign countries to place trade advertisements in the newspapers, Beijing and Washington are engaged in a bitter trade war that has resulted in increased tariffs on imports.
Taxes on Chinese goods were introduced earlier this year to curb imports from cities like Republican-controlled Iowa, according to Chinese business analysts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime Iowa governor, said that Beijing had wronged American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
"China is now adding to the pressure by publishing tough commercials in our free papers", wrote Branstad in a condolence column in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
"Through the advertising of their difficult business, the Chinese government is exposing itself to American liberal talk and the press by putting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, on a news desk in a Beijing street, you find little criticism and little dissent that the Chinese might have about China's seemingly declining business agenda, because the Chinese media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", it said.
He added that "one of the leading newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention the newspaper.
Republicans Discriminate Against Women in the Midterm Elections Because of Kavanaugh, Warns Reviewers
At a time when many Republicans were supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the alleged rape scandal, news analysts predicted a wave of attacks, particularly on women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The controversy surrounding the issue was high, and many Republicans were told that they were ready to vote.
These things are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an interview on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the recent pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would reignite the anger of angry voters.
"Mothers will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow and they will never forget November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, executive director and spokeswoman for the advocacy group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" in the Senate chamber as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee voted to move forward and elect Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"The pressure and excitement of the Democrats will come from the record", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan news analyst, told an online newspaper.
"People say it's a good idea; that's true.
But it can be a problem, especially among women and teenage voters in the communities of the Witnesses, ages 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, do not actually vote".
Even before Ford was sworn in as a witness to testify against his rape suspect and was elected to the Supreme Court, commentators warned of the possibility of an attack if Republicans pushed for his approval.
"This has become a major problem for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committee vote or whether Kavanaugh was on the bench, it's also the way Republicans handled the issue and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic election advocacy group, told a news conference.
However, the American public seemed divided over the Ford-Kavanaugh testimony and was generally supportive of Kavanaugh.
A recent survey by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents agreed with or disagreed with Ford's testimony, and 35 percent said they agreed with or disagreed with Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford's testimony.
Following the Flake raid, FIBI is now investigating the suspect who named Ford and another suspect, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was attacked while he was under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez also said that Supreme Court nominees were shown their private parts at a Yale student party in the 1980's.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a replacement for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is developing a new technology that could rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technologist's newest project was Inrupt, a new company that was working on Berners-Lee's Solid.
Solid prediction allows users to choose where their data should be stored and who should see it and when.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the main goal of Inrupt was "global coverage".
"We have to do this now", he said of the tool.
"It is a time to be foretold in the future".
The tool uses Solid technology to allow users to create a "persistent online archive" or POD.
You will find a schedule, activities, timetables, music storage and other human resources and tasks.
The tool is designed to allow Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify to be accessed on the same page at the same time.
Unlike the news feeds in this tool, it is up to the user to choose which news items to show to the public.
The company calls the tool "powering each one through my story".
Inrupt's design, according to CEO John Bruce, requires the company to integrate the functions and knowledge that make Solid available to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security contractor bought by IBM, other employees who were hired to work on the project, and others who volunteered to code.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own devices using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not consulting "Facebook and Google to develop a new version that would transform their entire business in a short period of time.
"We should not ask for permission".
In a statement on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission of the Inrupt tool is to empower businesses with the tools and services that help them protect the integrity and beauty of the new Internet tool Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the world of the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been talking about the issue of social justice.
Even before Inrupt was launched, Berners-Lee continued to serve as the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The WW1 Victoria Cross winner is honored
The only surviving Church of England chaplain to win the Victoria Cross during World War I was buried in the town of his birth 100 years ago.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the medal on the night of September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot dead by a sniper four days later and did not know that he had won the highest civilian award in Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called it a "beautiful landmark" that was to be unveiled 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on the night of September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his company through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a great silence and the sound of gunfire in the heavy trenches".
He then advanced to the next line "with great courage" as he led the advance of the gunners and fired his own shot, killing three soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German soldier on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that what his grandfather did was"something I probably wouldn't have done but it was a wonderful thing.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed flowers after the ceremony, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "they felt very honored to be part of the celebration" and added that "the glory of the great man is in the support of the many who give".
MMA fans wait all night for Bellator 206, but they are shown Peppa Pid
Imagine that you stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 but are denied access to the game.
Broadcast from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on card and broadcast throughout the UK on Radio 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, some UK viewers were surprised when the radio switched to Peppa Pig.
Some felt uncomfortable after staying awake until the early hours of the morning, or even after dark.
One Twitter user described the change of programming to a youth-oriented game as "a bad pastime".
"It is a federal policy that the program is not allowed to be shown at 6 a.m"., said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's deputy director of broadcasting and communications, when asked about the incident.
""Praying pigs", yes".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that the program would be rearranged to accommodate U.K. audiences in the future.
"I think that when I think about the repeat show, I hope we can do that", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday, and we can't do anything until our Sunday, which is on Monday.
But we are working on it.
Truly I say to you, many have come before you, but they have not come.
We fought for it, thinking that there was a problem.
But that was not the case.
I promise you that this will never happen again.
Now we're going to be playing five matches in the sixth - as we always do - and we wanted to get the audience's attention but we went too far.
It was a sad thing".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'unemployed' because of his body
Olympic athlete Tom Daley said that he grew up feeling unemployed to anyone because of his attachment to the institution of marriage - but that gave him the motivation to make a difference in the world.
A 24-year-old man did not realize until he entered high school that "other people were not crazy".
Speaking on the Radio 4 premiere of Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was speaking about the rights of couples who are seeking to give them "hope".
He also said that being a boxer helped him to reduce his anxiety about winning the Olympics.
The longtime host, Kirsty Young, is on a month's leave of absence because of illness.
Appearing as an unemployed person in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "low" in society as he grew up because "it was not acceptable for people to love boys and girls".
"To this day", she says, "those feelings of inferiority and specialness are among the things that give me the strength and motivation to make a difference in the world".
He wanted to prove that he was "in some way", as he put it, so as not to embarrass some who would not know anything about his creation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a fixture in the LGBT community and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge other countries to lift restrictions on gay marriage.
He said that he felt happy to be free from oppression and wanted others to share in "hope".
A three-time world champion said that he had "a wonderful love affair" with a young man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior this year but said that the age difference between them did not bother her.
"If you've been through so much in your youth" - she competed in the Olympics at 14 and her father died three years later - she said it was hard to find someone who was on the same day who had the same experiences, both good and bad.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his views" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my answer would always have been that I want to win the gold", he said.
"You know, there are more important things than winning gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is now Robbie".
His son bears the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father was not sure he was dying and asked questions about London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front seats.
"Did I not tell you that you would never see my Father again?" he asked.
"I held their hands until they ceased to breathe, and until they ceased to breathe, I knew that they too would be subdued".
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to stand in front of a crowd in my hometown at the Olympic Games, there was nothing better", he said.
So he chose the theme song - Proud by Heather Small - which he would sing throughout his Olympic preparations and which would give him a sense of urgency.

Mickelson is sidelined for a poor Ryder Cup game on Saturday
American athlete Phil Mickelson will make a name for himself on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup, but he has to work hard to avoid his darkest hour.
Mickelson, who is playing in his 12th double of the year, is placed next to his captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's games 4 and 4.
In the midst of all the fighting, as he does in the United States, the nine-time champion divides his day between being a champion and working on his team to solve the problems that plague him.
Never a perfect golfer at the height of his game, the 48-year-old athlete would not be able to compete on the Le Golf National course, where the length of the course often makes it difficult to dry out the dust from the road.
And if the length of the court alone is not a problem, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, has to face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with champion Tommy Fleetwood to win four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four goals in their 12-game series, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game will be even more difficult.
Furyk has full confidence in the man, not that he can say anything else.
"He knows exactly what he has to do today, he comes up to me a little later and hugs me and says he'll be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has faith in himself.
He's one of the hardest working people to be in the Hall of Famer and he's done a lot of additions to these groups in the past, and this week.
I never thought he would do it twice.
I expected more of him, but that never happened.
He was eager to be there, as were all the others".
Mickelson will surpass Faldo on the list of top players in Sunday's Ryder Cup.
It may be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been equalled by the size of his own team.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 draws, and a tie, although Furyk said his attendance brought results that are unimaginable in the crowd.
"He's funny, sometimes he talks difficult, he's funny, he likes to tell people jokes, and he's the nicest guy to have in a crowd room", she explained.
"I hope the youths enjoy it, as I did this week, which was fun.
He has more than I can give".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his legendary leadership may soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that his famous lead into the Ryder Cup quarterfinals could change his life in an instant.
The Danish star made his first appearance at the 1997 games at Valderrama, where the team captain Seve Ballesteros had to beat the Americans by five shots but in the end finished just close to the mark with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Always remember that we were way ahead at Valderrama; we were ahead at Brookline, where we won, and then at Valderrama, where we won", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and the previous day's 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So the past and all those present will prove that the story is not over.
Tomorrow will be a day of trouble.
Go and do what you can.
The issue will not be resolved until you have the necessary resolve.
We also run in a way that is not aimed at winning the prize.
As I always say, my focus is on the 12 players on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side - the strongest players in the world".
Rejoicing at the performance of his team in the exciting stadium, Bjorn added: "I can't work without preparation in this case.
Tomorrow is the night of the beast's encounter.
Tomorrow will be the day of the coming man, and this is a special occasion.
It's great to be with friends and have a good time, but when you're alone, you're being tested to the limit like a golfer.
These words should convince those who work hard, that you should be able to finish your hard work tomorrow.
But you leave behind a friend who has to work hard for his good, and you too".
In contrast to Bjorn, quarterback Jim Furyk will want more players per team than he would have if he was on the team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have three of the four.
Furyk himself was part of this final revolutionary moment, joining the winning team at Brooklyn before the European "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every word that was said about it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, led his team to the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to go to that first start like you saw at Brooklyn, like you saw at Medinah.
When such a force is confined to one side, it puts pressure on the central athlete.
We're going to arrange the players in order and put the guys in the right order, you know, and try to make a miracle tomorrow night".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the rematch and will face Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter among other Europeans on the other side of the ball.
"I joined the boys' team in this way because I thought it would do everything", says Bjorn of his team's individual selection.
The German battleship is once again extended
The new German Navy ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war ships, but was delayed until this year, due to equipment failures and rising costs.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class, has now been extended to early 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but shipping issues made that announcement a reality.
The Navy purchased four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen-class.
It was reported to have a powerful rocket launcher, a variety of aircraft and other ships as well as other technological devices, such as remote sensing, infrared and navigation instruments.
Another advantage of the long maintenance period is that the ships can be deployed from land for up to two years.
However, the prolonged buildup means that the good ships that were expected to defend Germany at sea will be out of commission by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The seemingly inoperable F125 was in port all year, when the Navy refused to unload the ship and returned it to the shipyard at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had rebuilt a ship after receiving it.
The reasons for the return were not well understood, but German radio reports cited "problems with the softs and some equipment" that would make the ship more efficient if sent to the salvage.
The softshore problem was particularly acute because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be manned by 120 men - half the number of men on the older Bremen class ships.
Furthermore, it was found that the ship was too heavy to be of much use and to reduce the Army's ability to carry out further repairs.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the size of the similar ships used in World War II in Germany.
In addition to some expensive equipment, the cost of the entire job - including the training of the drivers - was a major problem.
The price is reported to be €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - down from the original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with new ships were enormous in the wake of the current decline in German naval fleet.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German defense department, said that the Navy was "shrinking the number of ships that could be sent to the defense".
He noted that the problem is worsening over time, as older ships are being scrapped and no new ones are being built.
They complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be commissioned into the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secrets of the dark.
A study in the Scottish Highlands is exploring the use of land and volcanic activity to produce food.
It is hoped that the new findings will help shed new light on the behavior of these birds and help guide future ecological surveys.
This scientific study at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the popular variety of the soprano pipistrelle and the eardrum and the Daubenton Hills at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Recorders will be installed in the surrounding area to keep up with the regular activity of the mountains.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct the tests using the tools provided.
Red noise checks will be made on all the sounds of the dark clouds and the dark clouds doing various things.
The map and the map will be used to create a large-scale depiction of the prostitute and the dark side.
Rob Dewar, environmental consultant at NTS, hopes that the findings will reveal which areas are richest in volcanoes and how these areas are used by each type of volcano.
This report will help to understand the importance of conserving wetlands and the cost of maintaining the forest habitat and other natural resources.
The number of mountains in Scotland and the UK has declined over the past century.
It is threatened by development projects that disrupt bird habitats and destroy bird habitats.
Wind-powered electrical generators and lightning are also a threat, as are paper-based pesticides and some fireworks, as well as being eaten by bats.
The mountains are not tall.
However, because of their feeding habits, their ears are used more than their eyes when they are catching food.
They use a special sense of hearing to identify birds and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of 270 historic buildings, 38 rich gardens and 76,000 hectares of wildlife around the country, has taken special care of the mountains.
The agency has ten trained personnel, who perform research, search and rescue missions.
The Trust is also developing Scotland's first and only mountain reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which will house eight of the ten mountain species found in Scotland.
David Thompson, the park's director, called the area "a perfect habitat for the mountain".
"We have a large farm here in Threave", they said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a nice place for birds to nest.
But there are other mountain regions that are still unknown, and our work here will help us to understand more about the importance of mountains in their development".
He pointed to the value of surveying the mountains before undertaking conservation work, since the destruction of one bird sanctuary could kill up to 400 adult and young birds, destroying the entire population of the sanctuary.
Mountains are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or kill or destroy their habitat
Elisabeth Ferrell, director of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encourages the community to get involved.
"We have so much to learn about our mountains that we have no idea how many of them exist", she says.
Ronaldo denies a rape charge in a trial that was scheduled to take a German magazine to court
Cristiano Ronaldo claimed that the accusation of rape was "a false accusation", and that "some people tried to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers were preparing to take to court the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which had published the suspicious story.
The former captain of the Portuguese club Juventus has been accused of raping his American wife, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly later offered her a reward of up to $375,000 for the story, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In his video message that reached 142 million people on Instagram after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, denied the allegations as "fake".
"No, no, no, no. I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What they say today is a lie", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, looking at the camera.
"They were trying to take advantage of my name.
It does.
They want to be known by my name, but their work is not.
I'm happy and everything is going well", she adds, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are seeking to sue Der Spiegel over the attack, which they say is "a cover-up of a story that does not verify privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the plaintiff could seek compensation on the basis of "the violation of privacy in a series of violations of the law, one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in the lobby of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a bar, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the chairman's room, where he allegedly raped her from behind, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The mayor said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and said that he was "99 percent" a "healthy" person rather than "1 percent"
The papers said that Ronaldo admitted that he had actually had sex with her but only by mutual consent.
Mayorga also said that he went to the police and photographed the hospital evacuations, but later agreed to settle the case out of court for "fear of reprisals" and "public embarrassment".
The 34-year-old woman said that she wanted to appeal the case because she was still suffering from the pain of what had happened.
Ronaldo was in the process of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, at which point he signed for Italian side Juve for a fee of €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'laughs forever' at car manufacturers
The UK would 'laugh forever' if it lost its position as a post-Brexit carmaker, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "deeply disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without negotiations, it would halt car production at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need to reach an agreement", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker warned that the potential for delayed border opening due to the lack of Brexit negotiations could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - where Toyota Auris and Avensis are produced - produced some 150,000 cars that year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My guess is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of April we will see a halt in manufacturing in our region", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Burnaston executive.
Some UK carmakers have expressed concern about the EU exit issue without agreeing on how cross-border trade will play out, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini location in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The growing concern among automakers was the way sales would be if there were no Brexit negotiations.
Toyota's products are "on time", with supplies arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU dealers for pre-owned vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 April, there could be border disruption that could lead to delays and a lack of supplies.
It would be very difficult for Toyota to survive in Derbyshire for a day without the supplies, the company said, which would put the plants on hold.
Clark said that Theresa May's plans for future relations with the EU "are well-designed to avoid such border threats".
"We need a consensus. We need a good dialogue and consensus that allows us to, as I said, not only get the progress we're getting now but to get the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Toyota and other manufacturers have been pointing out that we need to add a more sustainable element to our business".
Toyota did not say how long it would take to get the buses back on the road, but over time, it has been suggested that rising prices could reduce the competitiveness of manufacturing and lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the local union, says that its members are very concerned: From what I have seen, such jobs are no longer seen as cheap.
A government spokesman said: "We have prepared a good and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be extended, White House says
The meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "extended by another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election fraud, the relationship between Trump supporters and Russia, and the presidential impeachment process.
Whether Trump will remove the attorney general or not, the potential threat to Mueller's freedom has been the talk of Washington for the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was planning to take a recorder that would record all of his conversations with Trump and see if the 25th Amendment could be used to impeach the president.
Rosenstein refutes that claim.
But on the previous Monday, when they were at the White House, the announcement of their resignation was made.
In the meantime, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, has been postponed to Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed due to the controversy over the Senate judiciary committee's ruling in which Kavanaugh and one of his alleged sexual assault victims, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both acquitted.
On Friday, Trump launched a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case, which delayed a Senate vote.
Trump correspondent Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When questioned about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date of the meeting is not fixed, it may be this week, it may be the next week because of the events at the supreme court.
But we'll talk and I'd like to keep the radio informed about what's going on".
Some media may disagree: Sanders has not spoken to the White House since September 10.
The program's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the decline in media coverage is not a "noticeable" loss of interest in TV news, although he added: "I don't deny the fact that they are".
They also said that Trump's media contacts would continue.
"Our leaders have enjoyed Q&A sessions more than any of our predecessors", he said, adding without specifying when: "We have talked about those numbers".
The conversation continues, Sanders said, but now "if the press has questions for the president of the United States himself, that would be better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you saw that last week and what happens during the press conference when you talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often answers questions on leaving the White House, either during interviews or during press conferences with invited guests.
Conversations with the media in private are not uncommon.
In New York City this week authorities demonstrated the motivation, the willing and sometimes surprising appearance of the clergy mob.
Health secretaries write to EU NHS staff in Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working on the NHS in Scotland to express their deepest thanks for continuing to work on the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent them a letter just six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made arrangements to cover all the costs of the social survey of EU nationals working in its territory.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU's representative body have continued, leading to a settlement by the autumn of this year.
But the UK government is already preparing for a possible failure to have a fair debate.
I see that this will be a difficult time for you.
So I want to talk about how I respect every worker's work, regardless of where they come from.
You, my colleagues from across the EU, are bringing the full knowledge to strengthen and improve the functioning of the health sector, and to benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your land and we want you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie Receives Emergency Care After a Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers coach Christion Abercrombie was hit in the head after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before mid-season rest.
"He went over to the side of the sword and shot himself", Reed said.
The medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie a ventilator and took him for a thorough examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had just returned from a surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the nature and extent of the wound" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine the time of the injury.
Abercrombie, a sophomore football player, was in his first season with Tennessee State after being drafted out of Illinois.
He had played five games on Saturday before leaving, bringing his team's total to 18.
International customers will be subject to higher taxes when purchasing goods in the UK
International buyers will be subject to a higher tax rate when purchasing goods in the UK and additional payments will be made to help homeless people in line with the Tory plans.
This will end the power of Corbyn to lure young voters.
This paper property tax will be paid by those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Fund expects to raise up to £120 a year for homelessness
International shoppers will be subject to a tax on their UK purchases - and the extra money will help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to bribe young voters who have promised affordable housing and fairness to the wealthy.
This paper property tax will be paid by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will help the Government work towards reducing the problem of homelessness.
This tax - which is a surcharge on the old tax, plus a higher one added two years ago for second homes and rents - would be 3 percent.
The Fund expects to generate up to £120 million a year.
Up to 13 percent of London's housing stock is owned by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for citizens to buy into the housing bubble.
Many economically prosperous areas have become "free cities" because of the long-term housing shortages of foreigners.
The new law comes just three weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to allow teenagers to own homes.
They argued that the developers had greatly increased house prices by owning but not using land, and they urged the Mays to avoid the prohibition of affordable housing so that the "disgrace of homelessness" in Britain could be reduced".
Corbyn gave a positive account of the social reforms, including the introduction of taxation and the end of "no-fault" evictions.
They also said that the governments would be given the authority to build new houses.
May said: "This year I have made a commitment to my leadership to revive the British dream - to make a better life for all the new generations.
This means cleaning the messy corners of our homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live in it.
However, it is not uncommon for UK residents, as well as international companies, to be treated in the same way as British nationals.
For many the dream of owning a house is far away, and the disrespect of not having a place to sleep is increasing".
Jack Ross: 'My most cherished responsibility is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross called his "greatest gift" to be Scotland manager for a time.
The Scottish star, 42, was excited about the prospect of taking the third-placed team in League One, the North-East, three points off the podium.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after re-establishing St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I always wanted to play for the national team.
I had a B cap and it was gone", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"But I grew up watching the Scottish team at Hampden a lot with my father, and that's one of the things that keeps me going.
However, the opportunity may come if I can do well in the leadership of the group".
The coaching behind Ross included Sunderland coaches Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic captain said he was not afraid to follow the big names after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My current performance will be measured by the question 'Can I get this club back in the Premier League?'
"Given the structure of the club, the fact is that the club should be in the Premier League", he said.
"It is not an easy task to get this group there, but I will feel satisfied if I succeed in getting the group there".
Ross spent three years in management, after serving as deputy manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in training with Hearts.
He also helped Alloa from bottom to number three, turning St Mirren from near-miss and leading them to the Championship title the following season.
Ross also said that he feels better now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Although it was time to make a strong net", he recalled, he began to support the Alloa group.
"I honestly know that I have more to gain from being a manager than from playing football.
It sounds amazing because I've done well, I've made a good living, I've been happy when I'm on top.
But playing can be difficult at times.
There are things you need to do each week.
I still struggle with the stress and pressure of this job, but the direction is clear.
I always wanted to be a leader, and today I am, and it sounds like the best thing I've ever heard in my entire adult life".

The best time to drink a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to research
The heat of summer has made British farms more efficient than the factories.
Corn sales rose 2.7 percent in July - but the situation was not good in the market, where sales fell 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA marketing agency, which compiled the figures, said: "The steady increase in the number of people playing the World Cup in England means that July followed the same pattern as the previous June, with the number of tickets up 2.8 percent, except that the number of restaurants has fallen back.
The 1.8 percent drop in food sales in June worsened in July.
All the liquor stores have been successful in comparison with restaurants.
We have also reduced the number of stalls selling cereal, but not to the point of reducing the number of food stalls.
It seems that people are just going to drink.
All-purpose beer sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales fell 3 percent".
"These trails show the same pattern that has been observed since late September", says Paul Newman, of the RSM's Research Center for the Study of Pleasure and Human Behavior.
The weather and the sporting events and mass gatherings have contributed to the rapid growth of the housing market.
It is surprising that the fast-growing retail sector continues to suffer, although the 4.8 percent decline in the number of stores compared to the previous year is compounded by the deteriorating prices.
Summer heat cannot come at such a difficult time for the food industry and it is only then that the cooler weather we experience in July will make a positive trade change".
Sales growth in the food and beverage industry, including new business, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new business.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks the UK's peach and peach markets, will collect market research data from 47 groups with a combined value of £9 billion, and set a benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a hidden account of a sexual relationship with their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have had a superstitious conversation with their parents and teachers, a survey found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a surge in "fake" instagram pages
This article has caused me great concern that the content of these pages may be obscene
20 percent of the students said that they had a large account to show to their parents
One in five children - some under 11 - have a personal account that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a surge in "fake instagram" pages - referring to the photo-sharing tool instagram.
This article has caused me great concern that the content on these pages may be obscene.
20 percent of students said they use a large clean account that they can show to their parents, and then they have other private accounts.
One parent who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found that she was pressuring her friends to "have sex with me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of 11-18-year-olds had two accounts, with half of those children reporting that they were hiding separate accounts.
"It is unfortunate that teenagers are tempted to create online communities that their parents and teachers cannot see", says HMC executive director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" under the leadership of Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the association.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most decorated track and field athletes and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those in charge of the sport to benefit from the vast experience she has been gathering around the world for the past decade.
"Eilidh is a well-respected figure in Scottish sport, the UK and the world for those running and we hope that Scottish sport will benefit greatly by bringing her to the governing body", said Beattie.
"I am ready to be the voice of the race and I hope to add to the responsibility and help to lead the race in Scotland", says Doyle.
The American athlete, Olympic gold medalist in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games and BBC correspondent, was left paralyzed after suffering a stroke.
"I have had a stroke for over a month now", she wrote on Twitter.
I could not walk.
"I'll wait a while, " he said, "and see how I get better".
It was hard work, but I got healthy, I learned to walk again, I now use my body to help myself.
Thank you for the encouraging words!"
The promotion of a milk-milk-milk formula that mimics the brothers' cow has caused a rift on the Internet
A dairy company has sparked a riot online by comparing mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what has been described as "the world's first milk-pumping garment", technology company Elvie is launching a special video commercial that showcases the freedom that milk-pumping offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four sisters are shown singing together in a cow-feeding restaurant to the tune of the song: "Yes, I want milk, but you can't see the tail" and "If you don't look, this is not cow's milk, it's human milk".
The song continues: "Blow, blow, I am feeding the children, blow, blow, I am hiding my girls".
However, this advertising campaign, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked a wave of online attacks.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reviews, many of which said it was an understatement of the dairy industry.
"It is a terrible thing to use bulls to spread this message.
Someone wrote that we women are pregnant and give birth, but that they are weaned after a few days.
Elvie's milk-sucking puppy is perfectly placed in the lap of the nursing mother (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It seems to be a confusion between the mother and the child.
But why not use it in a marketing campaign for a breast-feeding supplement?"
Another added: "Advertising from the street".
Others supported the ad, and one woman called the song "beautiful".
"I think it's a good job.
I can get one myself if I try.
The milk made me feel like a cow.
This announcement is difficult but I took it.
This is a gift of wisdom", one writer wrote.
Another observed: "This advertising is directed at women who milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "cows".
This is not a compliment or a judgment on the dairy business".
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they are all holding each other while they are about to suck milk into their mouths.
The information in this advertisement is based on the comments of many nursing mothers who say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is noisy, has no rope or belly and will sit in the middle of the pack, allowing mothers to move around, hold their babies and help out elsewhere while they breastfeed.
Ana Balarin, assistant and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is such a powerful device that it needs a good boost of energy to start using it.
By imitating mothers who suckle cows we wanted to bring the milk supply and its problems to the fore, showing in a humorous and vivid way the richness of freedom that the new tool brings.
This is the first time that the Elvie pump has appeared in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared in a fashion show with Marta Jakubowski wearing the device.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Silently Tortured to Tent Camps at the Texas Border
The number of child migrants being held has risen despite the fact that the number of crossings of the border over the past month has remained relatively constant, due to the strict policies created by the Trump administration and the tightening of child support measures.
Naturally, many supporters are also undocumented immigrants, and they fear they too may be expelled if they come forward to offer assistance to any child.
The problem was exacerbated in June, when authorities ordered that beneficiaries and other family elders bring their fingerprints, and other evidence, to the elderly who were awaiting entry into the country.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had reached a record number of volunteers to help immigrant children who were not supported by their parents.
The panel reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior convictions.
"Nearly 80 percent of the aid workers or their dependents have entered the country illegally, and many of them are legal refugees in their home countries.
So we are continuing to search for these people", Albence said.
In order to speed up the case, the synod ordered that some of these children appear in court within a month of their arrest, not 60 days after their usual service, according to the camp officials.
Many will be seen through video chat, so that they can answer their immigration cases to a judge.
Those found to be unfit will be reinstated promptly.
The children's detention in the camps will expose them to anxiety and emotional torture, which may lead to violent escape attempts, according to the workers who built the camps and the staff who were brought in to do so in the past few months.
Child advocates say that this concern is growing in large areas such as Tornillo, where signs of child abuse are often ignored, because of the size of the area.
They added that taking children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare and to visit friends can only exacerbate the suffering they have already experienced.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish soldiers to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the war now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is currently serving as Prime Minister, said that foreign military units are in his area illegally, will be charged with anti-terrorism, and will be dealt with as follows".
"Let these men go out at once, without charge", they ordered the Sanhedrin.
Moualem insists that "the war on terror is ending" in Syria, where some 360,000 people have died since 2011, and many more have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue "to wage this holy war until we had removed from the territory of Syria" all the rebel groups and "all those who had joined them from other lands".
The United States has up to 2,000 troops in Syria, providing advice and counsel to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad's rule.
France has about 1,000 troops in the war - torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the country was safe enough to return to and complained about "some eastern countries" for "spreading fear among the people" that made refugees afraid to return.
"We have appealed to the international community and aid agencies to help the return of the people", he said.
"They were putting political words in a story that could be beneficial".
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that no reconstruction aid will be provided until there is a peaceful agreement between Assad and his allies to end the war.
UN officials said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a military training center in the rebel-held Idlib region offers hope for further talks.
Russian - Turkish negotiations prevented a Russian - backed Syrian invasion of the province, which has a population of about 1 million.
But Moualem said that the agreement had "a definite deadline" and expressed hope that the military action would bring jihadists, including the Nusra Front of Al-Qaeda, "to an end".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that a new committee of government and opposition officials will be convened to draft a draft law that will work after the end of the war in Syria and allow for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government's recommendations for the committee, saying that the committee's task was "to review the texts in the existing national literature", and warned that no one should compare these recommendations.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
In light of this, Trump could only win the 2020 election, as many liberals hope, if his removal from power is swift and immediate.
In what appears to be "the most difficult story in the history of human government".
At this point, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the average viewing time has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has 2.4 million peak viewers from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" has closed to 3.5 million viewers on news days.
"This is a fire that people were afraid of because it was something we didn't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who is running for president after one of the attacks devastated the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author and performer of the comedy "Just the Funny Parts: And A Few Hard Facts About Getting into the Boys Club of Hollywood", has another story.
He recalled a car ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
What will be the cause? he asked.
"Because they make me laugh", he replied", said Mrs. Scovell.
There is a lot of fun in the countryside.
In fact, unlike other television programs, the Washington news headlines could decide the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families who entered the country could reunite and the fate of the global economy.
It is one of the finest programs that a fortunate few can afford
But it's beyond the consciousness of a citizen to find on the sixth season of the show a panel discussion on Bob Woodward's "secret" use of his book "Fear", a $15,000 leather coat by Paul Manafort ("a coat of pride", according to the Washington Post) that would be a popular reference in Stormy Daniels's commentary on Trump's designs.

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss' home this week, it was early afternoon and 80 degrees outside his home on the southern tip of Kauai, but he was crouching inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't even make a fuss, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to meet with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's agenda seemed to be on the table.
"I remember when we did programs like this in the past and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Eastern Renaissance,'" Fleiss told me.
"I was supposed to be funny, but it turned out to be true".
Amy Chozick, the Times' business, political and media correspondent, writes a timeline called "Chasing Hillary".
Foreign investment is plunging the House into a struggle for a strong middle-term.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is the most lucrative in this regard, thanks to a congressional change that saw two candidates running for the same seat.
The newly renovated Pittsburgh district is contested by Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another city in a special election the previous year.
Lamb was running against a Republican incumbent, Keith Rothfus, for Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, which is split from the 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old towns had been illegally demarcated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th District is for campaign finance in a contest between the major parties in the budget, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a highly contested special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the city by 20 points.
The media have given the Democrats a lot of power and opportunity.
The U.S. Reviews Sanctions on El Salvador for Supporting China, After It Turns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing's leadership, with a modicum of opposition from Washington.
Trump had a successful conversation with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until his colleagues dismissed the Trump administration.
The State Department decided to expel the U.S. ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for "the last remaining states that do not recognize Taiwanese leadership", said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were aimed at El Salvador, which received nearly $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including a surge in drug trafficking, development and trade aid.
The sanctions, which include cuts in aid and travel restrictions, are a major threat to the Central American country's high unemployment and murder rate.
While the talks are going on, officials from North and Central America have postponed the National Security and Economic Summits, a follow-up to a similar summit last year that was seen as a new step in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, the authorities had declared their intention to continue the conventions, effectively completing any sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the meeting, scheduled for mid-February, in the lobby of the local logistics department, the delegates said.
Three American diplomats also returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any serious news or punishment from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the discussion points presented by three senior U.S. diplomats, including two who agreed to discuss the points in a request for anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an investigator who was close to the administration and who also said under oath that his name would not be released.
Learn From the Past
The next story may be that of my lawyer Robert Mueller's attempt to confuse the Trump administration, which has a lot of documented evidence.
Mueller is reportedly revising his research to see if Trump's financial interests were complicit in Russia's election attacks.
If Congress does change the system, Trump will find himself in the wrong party, as soon as he is ready to run for re-election, or even stand for the election of his colleagues.
The uncertainty here is overwhelming, and I'm not saying Trump's downfall will happen - or that of his European counterparts.
There are limits to the extent of the war that we can all face on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officials were preparing to overthrow Hitler, so the East met him with the support of Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed, missing the opportunity to stop the next years of human death.
The old story is circulated by this change of format, and the story of the unchanging freedom of speech is either suppressed or unchallenged.
Americans are now going through these turbulent times.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who is repeating the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep trouble ever since the paper announced that, this year, he had proposed to begin recording presidential debates in secret and to argue that presidents should not be in office.
Rosenstein said that The Times' statement was not accurate.
"What if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh by the F.B.I. is not complete or fair - even if it is authorized by the Supreme Court or if there is a suspicion of coercion and dishonesty?
And most important, will we decide in a midterm vote for Congress that leaves Trump accountable?
If we fail our test, the right to free speech will be in jeopardy for a long time.
But I am confident that we will, because of the training I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that at one time occupied my embassy.
They escaped, made their way to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with the swastika cross.
But after passing through this, how can I not have hope for our goal?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers looks forward to the Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Tuesday, knowing that beating the Austrians, a hard-fought series against Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to be relegated from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing in the first game of the season until a 2-2 loss to Villarreal but he was hopeful that the Rangers could use the experience as a stepping stone.
"It was a good time for us because Villarreal is a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered this game thinking we could take something and we actually got one.
Perhaps we should return to the last call today, in which we see that the fall of the monarchy was a good thing.
They did well in the first chapter and we did well in the second chapter to be better than them.
As we head to Cine, another day will be spent with them in Europe.
Hopefully, we can take three points but it will be a tough game because they had good points in the last game today, with a bunch of supporters, I hope we will win well.
Last year was a tough one, amidst all the things that happened to me and my injuries and the changes in our squad but now the squad is very clear.
The crowd is good and the young people are good, and the discipline is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, putting the past behind us and winning".
My mother was sleepless because of the fear of retirement savings
Although the study participants had a good idea of what they wanted to be cared for, few of them told their relatives about it.
Up to half of the respondents in the Worldwide Survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said that they had spoken to their children about the matter.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance Company.
That was just the beginning.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot plan for a living if you do not know what your needs are ahead of time.
Be devoted to the family, and to the work of hospitality, which is of great benefit to all.
Involve your financial advisers: Your advisers can help you find ways to pay for your finances.
Your long-term care insurance may be covered by a well-known long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy that allows you to pay for the expenses or to pay for yourself with your own money - if you have the money.
Work hard on your paperwork: Finish the legal battle before it comes.
Keep a medical record with you so that you can appoint a trusted health care provider to ensure that your patients follow your instructions if you are unable to speak.
Think, too, of the person who will be in charge of your finances.
You can choose a reliable person to set up a financial plan for you and to make sure that all your debts are paid off in the event of a power failure.
Do not forget to include all the necessities: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a life-threatening situation and are being taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about their medical treatment and the issues that affect their health?
Give these instructions in an orderly manner so that you will be ready.
"You didn't just steal the money, but you wanted to find out who could have?" asked Martin.
"What kind of treatment?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for this".
A man is shot multiple times in Ilfracombe
One man was shot several times on his way home from a night out.
The man, in his 40s, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, having been stabbed in the chest, neck and neck.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as "a random act of violence"
The man did not see the assailant.
The officer ordered that any witnesses who could prove his guilt should be brought before him.
Earthquakes and waves in Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu on Friday killed 384 people, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
By the time the communications were broken, relief workers were unable to receive any regular communication from Donggala, a region north of Palu near the epicentre of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, some 16,000 people were evacuated during the disaster.
Here are some facts from the areas of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located on the western tip of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary of independence when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a 300-kilometer (180 - mile) stretch of coastline on the eastern tip of Sulawesi.
This area, which is the administrative center of the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala area.
Nickel mining is also rich in the province, but the largest deposits are in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the past century, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, tidal waves killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is a frequent earthquake-prone region.
The following is a list of the largest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake off the coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late July and early August.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami off the southern coast, killing nearly 700.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Up to 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck a village on the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing waves as high as 10 meters to destroy several villages and kill 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and concern as people remember the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No waves erupted during the event, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse.
2018: A major earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia's most popular tourist destination, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed many buildings and left thousands of tourists homeless.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Child Imprisoned for Violence and Oppression
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and candidate for President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of assault, comparing the penalty of a felony to a misdemeanor, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when the girl who saw it tried to call the police, Palin answered the phone.
Palin is currently being held in solitary confinement at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, truthfully, when questioned about the case, the broadcaster reported.
Palin had three Class A misdemeanours, which could mean a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
I am also charged with a Class B misdemeanour, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a fine of up to $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been convicted of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was convicted of assault, aggravated battery, and assault with a deadly weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
A friend said that he had hit her in the face with a coffee.
Sarah Palin was harassed by veteran organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son's violence to PTSD from her work in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
A total of 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Thursday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake caused waves that destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electrical wires and communications were cut and deaths were expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the coast of central Sulawesi, just east of the beautiful Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on the internet showing the extent of the destruction.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the banks of the Palu River when the waves hit the island.
Prosecutors in court demanded the death penalty for the suspected NYC attack
New York City prosecutors are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York City bombing that killed eight people - the highest execution in the country in a nationwide case since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is suspected of using a Home Depot truck to pull the trigger on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists in the summer months.
To carry out the death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov killed eight people "on the spot" and inflicted "on the spot" bodily harm, according to a death-penalty complaint filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both cases carry the death penalty, according to the court order.
Within weeks of the accident, a jury convicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with the aid of a fraudster, a commonly used term in criminal prosecutions, and one count of vehicular manslaughter.
The attack required "exceptional planning and preparation", said the prosecutor, describing Saipov's conduct as "cruel, ruthless and brutal".
"Saifullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused the pain, suffering, and loss of the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", said the report.
Five of the people surveyed were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last decided on a death sentence.
The then-prosecutor, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing drug traffickers but his sentence was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a New York state death sentence was handed down was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husbands later convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse for his actions in the months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt very comfortable with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told prosecutors that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to court documents.
He even asked to have an ISIS banner hung in his hospital room, police said.
He denies all 22 charges on the judgment.
David Patton, one of the lawyers representing Saipov, said that he was "very disappointed" by the court's decision to grant the verdict.
"We think that the prospect of a death sentence rather than a conviction and life imprisonment will only increase the suffering of those involved", said Paton.
Saipov's prosecutors first asked the prosecutor whether they wanted the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given the task of overseeing Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to 'pull the crowd' today during the Tory demonstrations.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians 'must have heard a sigh' from the Eurosceptics - as one of the MPs, Theresa May, pledged to lead the negotiations with the EU.
The outgoing Conservative leader Peter Bone made the comment in Birmingham that the UK would 'have left by now' had Farage been the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reuniting her scattered party is compounded by the pro-Remain Tories' involvement in a unique protest against Brexit in the city.
The supreme leader is confident of keeping his Union safe in the face of attacks from the Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
His allies said they would continue to seek to reach a deal with Brussels despite possible delays - forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what they had and the 'blueprint'.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave conference in Solihull that he wanted to 'get out of the Chequers story'.
He suggested that Farage be appointed as a member and be assigned to liaison with Brussels.
'The ones already involved, now let's get out of here,' they said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I am against Brexit but we must withdraw from the Chequers plan.'
In his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight a world war to avoid being taken advantage of.
We want to make our own laws as a country.'
Bone denies that public sentiment has changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British mindset has changed and they want to stay in the dark is too much.'
Tory Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was present, telling reporters: 'My message is this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers are unknown to most citizens, unrecognizable to the opposition, unrecognizable to our party and to those who speak for us in the streets and get us kicked out of our seats.
Please sign up for the Chequers and start listening.'
In words that apply to May, he said: 'Many prime ministers are long-term if they keep their promises.'
Farage told the politicians at the rally that they should feel safe if they want to override the 2016 referendum.
'The issue is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and myself as a politician,' he said.
'They are trying to confuse the Brexit issue and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow that to happen with integrity.'
Addressing a seemingly cheerful crowd, he added: 'I want you to give the politicians, who want to confuse the Brexit debate, a big bang.
'We are assembling the people who have given us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we are a free, sovereign, proud United Kingdom.'
On the other hand, the Leftists traveled through Birmingham for a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
A small group of supporters unveiled placards with the slogan Tories Against Brexit after the start of the protest this weekend.
A Labour official named Adonis praised the Conservatives for the protection they had received from the party's toolbox after the meeting opened.
'These are the people who tell us they can have the strong IT systems and technology of Canada and beyond, the seamless border, the borderless free trade in Ireland,' he added.
'The confusion is over
There has never been anything better than a good Brexit,' he added.
"Warren was preparing to consider running for president".
U.S. Representative Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she was "considering a run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat outlined his future goals during a presidential debate in an east Massachusetts town hall Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, was running for re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, a candidate for the 2016 presidential nomination in Massachusetts.
He is on the list of candidates to succeed Trump in 2020.
Saturday's gathering in Holyoke was the 36th time the group and its community have used the hall since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked them if they were planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government, which meant women were in the top leadership.
Cases in the highly publicized case of Sims of LSU
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that one person had been arrested in connection with the alleged assault on Wayde, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
Baton Rouge police said that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. ET in a news conference.
The video was removed on Friday, and people were asked to tell the story of the person in the video.
Sims, 20, was pronounced dead at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died from the wound", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
The man went to protect his friend and was then raped by Simpson.
Simpson was found at the scene, armed, and admitted to having abandoned Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and held in a cell at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and scored 10 touchdowns in his final season with 17.4 minutes, 5.6 minutes and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Drivers' Championship: Lewis Hamilton is named world champion after a jury verdict allows him to beat Sebastian Vettel
It was clear at the time of Valtteri Bottas' victory over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's "decision" would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas made a good start by almost eliminating Hamilton as he defended his place in the second round and called on Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel stepped aside and let Hamilton go inside, which was supposed to be a surprise.
Mercedes was driving in behind Vettel, but Hamilton was leading in the same direction, forcing the Ferrari driver off the middle lane after the second lap to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back and finished seventh at the end of lap one on his 21st birthday.
He then continued the long run by grabbing his tires and trying to finish faster than Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He later came in on lap 44 but failed to improve on the last eight laps as Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult night because Valtteri had done a good job on the weekend and the best man to let him go was the best man.
The team has done very well with the 1 and 2 tones", said Hamilton.
The Speech of the Flesh
President Donald Trump has criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein at a press conference on Saturday for insisting that she did not distribute letters to Christine Blasey Ford suspecting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of a power struggle.
In his speech to the West Virginia convention, the president did not mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he said that the Senate's record shows that the people are "cruel and ignorant and lying".
"One of the most likely and positive things that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is that you look at the anger, you see people who are angry, violent, disrespectful, and lying", he said.
"I'd look at the story that they'd put out and they'd say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I did not".
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you produce the report?
Remember his reply...did you take out the paper - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I did not".
Oh, wait a minute.
We've got the story", he added, in a speech to the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford in July describing all the suspects in Kavanaugh's case, and the story was leaked - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide my suspicions about Dr. Ford, I didn't spread his story", Feinsntein told the committee, according to Hill's sources.
I was asked to keep the talk confidential and I kept it confidential as requested.
But their refusal was not understood by the authorities, who said during the Saturday meeting: "I tell you, that was a bad fleshly speech.
Maybe not, but that was the most violent body language I've ever seen".
In addition to defending the Supreme Court nominees, who are accused of attempted rape and three other women, the governors said the Democrats were using the allegation to their advantage.
They were determined to seize power by any means possible.
Behold, they are cruel, they are insolent, they do not care for the wounded, they are arrogant in order to gain power and authority", the Medes quoted the rulers as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won their last Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the replay 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly added two more to the roster, with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored the same number of runs before Dwyer moved the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard was the first to compare Dundee when two boats were won by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
This was the third Elite League game of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the 4th minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford came in as Beauvillier extended the lead a few minutes later.
It was a busy opening session, with Sullivan putting his team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt made a match against Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead during the first half when he hit a second home run late in the night.
The stadium crowd gathered and Bouchard again came in to match the ball with a hardball at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give the Dundee team a first-round lead in the second set and ensure victory for his team in the fifth through final round.
The Giants, who had lost four of their five games, were to meet up with Milton Keynes for the next game on Thursday.
An Air Traffic Controller Dies to Save Hundreds of People on a Plane
A hero - lauded Indonesian airline pilot later died trying to get a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely off the ground.
About 800 people were rescued and others were missing after the earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Thursday and raised waves on the sea.
The earthquake was so powerful that many were trapped on rocks near Pallas.
But despite the desperation of his fellow workers, 21-year-old teacher Anthonius Gunawan Agung refuses to leave his workplace in the shaking tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on its way to the airport, could take off safely.
He then leapt out of the tower when he saw that it was falling.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said that the plane saved many lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have arranged for a helicopter to take you from Balikpapan Hospital in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we missed him this morning before the plane reached Palu.
"Our hearts are overwhelmed at hearing these things", they added.
On the other hand, officials feared that the death toll could reach thousands and the disaster-ridden part of the country suggested that the roads to the Donggala, Sigi and Boutong forts were impassable.
"The death toll is expected to rise because of the large number of bodies left in the rocks", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
Waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] swept over the tropical city of Palu on Sunday.

Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a car is bringing bodies.
Safe water was not available.
Small towns are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the International Red Cross's head of mission in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to pick up people but we don't know what we are going to get.
It is a serious threat, but it is likely to increase".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to finish all the work that has to do with human trafficking.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was struck by a devastating earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims one person missing after crash into a sinkhole
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims one missing person, after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the hijacked plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement Saturday evening that he did not know where any of the men who had been on the bus were.
The airline said it was working with local residents, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The company did not immediately respond to other details about the person, such as his age and nationality.
The local ferry rescued the crew and the pilot after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land on Chuuk Island.
The company said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The company said six of the men were in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the crash and the details of the incident are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both claimed that the plane crashed into the water while on its way to crash into a crowded runway.
Some witnesses reported that the plane had missed the runway.
American explorer Bill Jaynes noted that the plane was flying westward.
"That was a wonderful experience", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get to the exit of the crash while the plane was sinking.
He said the flight attendants were screaming in anger, and he said he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that dock workers also helped to rescue the victims by using a pump boat to get them across before the boat sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG registered crashes in the past 20 years.
A researcher records a time when the mother was beaten alive
A jury on Saturday dropped a case of a suspected 2014 Mississippi woman who was burned alive.
U.S. Justice Department investigator Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a witness in a criminal investigation.
He explained to the court how he used phone records to try to piece together the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the day of their death.
Rowlett said she received location data from the phone calls that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the day of his death, which was different from her initial statement, according to the Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that Chambers had her cell phone at the time she said she was with her friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford comes to his desk and denies that he was in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor whether Tellis was telling the truth about his being in the Sanford Bus that day, Sanford said that he was "just lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another variant is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks before his death.
The phone records showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted all of her text messages, phone numbers, and regular messages on her phone.
"He had to take her out of his life", Hale said.
The court is expected to begin deliberations on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be heard by the jury on the same day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists wanted to work on a soundtrack that would include a message of social justice.
High Breed, a band from Bristol, said that hip-hop music grew out of a system of social and political satire.
They wanted to restore the plant to its original state and make it a useful tool for solving social problems.
Some artists such as Fugees and Common have also been instrumental in the UK revival of the genre through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Who else is there?!
A NY City real estate agent sued a couple after being fired on "racial" grounds
A NY city housewife sued a husband and wife after being fired after receiving a supposed phone call from her mother complaining that she was "a different person".
The two men deny accusations of racial discrimination, citing the case as "a case of money laundering".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was devastated to discover that her nanny, Giselle Maurice, had passed away when she first arrived on the job in 2016.
"I AM a DEAD man", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a telephone message.
But in the process of sending this message to her husband, she was sent to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After learning of the "screaming" error, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that her African-American nanny was a violent and expectant Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid his day's wages and fired from Uber.
Maurice, however, sued the family for $350 a day for six months, which they had signed up for, even though they had no objection.
"I want to show them, look, that's not how we do it", he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's biased".
The husband and wife also deny the accusation of racial discrimination, saying that it is better to expel the Aristic, fearing that they will lose their trust after the error.
"My wife sent messages that she should not have said.
They are not partial.
We are not prejudiced", Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you give your children to the one you have chosen, even though you do not know him?
Is your baby a baby?
Think about it".
Comparing the case to "a financial scandal", Plasco's wife had just two months to conceive, and she was "not feeling well".
"Would you approach such a man?
This is not the right thing to do", the treasurer added.
While the case was still pending, the local council sharply criticized the family for their unethical behavior and lack of civic wisdom.
Paddington publishers threatened that readers would not be able to decide who was speaking, a new letter revealed
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is hard to put yourself in the shoes of a first-time reader who has not been accepted.
It is good to know now what we know about the Paddington effect".
His father, who had worked as a copywriter for the BBC before being encouraged to write this children's book and a real toy, would not be pleased to find his work censored, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was strong after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, described as "the great patriarch of our family", he added that his father was very proud of his work.
"He was a man of lowliness of mind, and he was not proud", they added.
"But because Paddington was one of his most famous, it was like having a child who did something good: you're proud even if you didn't do it.
I hope he saw the Paddington's effectiveness in this regard.
Though it was his own invention and imagination, he always offered sacrifices to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I was on the phone with her
There her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors performed a life-saving operation.
"Nad would text repeatedly saying that it was terrible", said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in the last two minutes and I told him to come.
That is what I did.
I said, "Thank you, I love you so much, my dear.
I'm with you now.
I will be with you.
The drugs given to him for the heart attack were slowly weakening and leaving his body.
For once he died, for the things that were now were made perfect.
I sat and waited, and I saw.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to be strong".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other young men - unaware of the plight they were facing.
"No one knew", they said.
"I fell on my face, my face was covered with tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was while I was flying that I felt this compassion for Nad.
That he wanted my love and respect.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide worked hard to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have started putting up cards on the Welsh Bridge with friendly messages and numbers to send if they need help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to hear what I hear every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, had a son who was a good cook and had a good smile.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile was a hallmark of every room".
However, he resigned before his death, as he was in serious trouble".
In 2014, my brother Tyler, who was 11 at the time, was reunited with his older brother after he committed suicide.
"I always worry that there may be a repeat of the story with her little sister", said Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis designed cards "to let people know that you can talk to someone, even a friend.
Don't try to keep quiet - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, also lost her friend of 15 years, Mark, not long after her mother's death.
"He never said he was feeling stressed or pressured or anything", they said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his personality.
He was the most depressed on Christmas Day - when the kids were unwrapping their presents he didn't look up to see them or look at anything".
She said that her death was a great loss for them, but they had to overcome it: "It leaves a deep wound in the family.
It is a distraction.
But we must continue to fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's motives are under question as the FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like he was asking - timely, thorough investigation - maybe we could get some consensus", Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "split" in the middle of a difficult bipartisan debate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his fellow Republicans not want an FBI investigation?
Their ignorance is temporary.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will be very disappointed in having their favorite nominee for the highest court in this country.
George W. Bush is calling the Senators, asking them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush's presidency and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its information?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh will win the 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow presidential candidate Mike Pence to cast a qualifying vote for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans leaving "decreased" under Kim
The number of North Korean migrants to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, according to a South Korean official.
Park Byeong-seug, calculating figures from the South unification ministry, said there were 1,127 foreigners last year compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the reason for this is the tightening of the border between North Korea and China and the high fines imposed on human traffickers if caught.
Pyongyang has not commented.
Many North Koreans who have immigrated to South Korea have been granted citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee to China, which shares the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers these people to be illegal immigrants and refugees and often returns them to their homeland.
Relations between the North and the South - which have been at war for much of their history - have been improving in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the issue of nuclear disarmament.
This followed the unprecedented June meeting between US Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they discussed the joint commitment to a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the delay in the process.
"If there is no trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and if that is the case, there will be no way to disarm ourselves", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York City.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "extremely unfit" to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court "a sham" and would not qualify him for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I don't know how to put it into words that even a woman has ever 'driven like that,'" Pelosi said in her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Truth.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied suspicions that he had sexual relations with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh made a strong statement, at times with a scream and a scolding, about his family and his school years.
They also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against them were "conceived and deliberately intended to tarnish their reputation" and were prepared by people angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she was convinced that Kavanaugh's conviction made it clear that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, because he had demonstrated a political aversion.
"I think they've taken it out on themselves through the language and the manner in which they've spoken to Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was adamant when asked if she was considering removing Kavanaugh from office if she was confirmed, and if the Democrats had a majority in the House.
"I'm saying this -- if they didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then they shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, but being in the court is what they are", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently awaiting trial in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about how Kavanaugh will decide the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as well as being thought of as a conservative judge.
In his convincing defense, Kavanaugh failed to answer questions about the interpretation of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the time for a man to accuse us, to go to the council and hope that we will support it", said Phelps.
Mothers Need to Work on It
The truth of anger, the fury of months and months flies, and he cannot speak without weeping.
"We always cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
"When I was a warden, " he continued", a woman helped me. She said that she would cry when she was angry, but she made a point of telling the person who was talking, "You must think I'm angry because I'm crying.
I am angry with you".
And he added:
I thought it was a good idea"
Tears seem to be partly due to misunderstanding.
One of the best memories of my first job, in a manly office, where I left in tears and rage, was when I was tortured by an older woman - a cruel supervisor whom I had always feared - who carried me up the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry", he told me.
"They don't know I'm mad.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they've conquered you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught by a woman on the Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, Schroeder, in a fit of rage, began to consider what might prevent him from running for president himself.
"It was not a well-prepared dress", he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven men sitting at a table, and they were looking for someone to eat.
One person likened it to the story "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because of the limited time available, they decided against the money, so they promised not to delay until they could raise $2 million.
It was a brutal struggle.
It turned out that some of the men who gave $1,000 were receiving only $250.
"Does he think I'm a big shot?" they thought.
When she publicly announced that she would not run, she was overwhelmed by a series of emotions - gratitude for her supporters, resentment at the campaign that promoted the issue of money and electoral justice over social justice, and anger at the stigma of being a woman - that made her feel oppressed.
"You might think that my body might be damaged", recalled Schroeder when the radio began talking about him.
"You could say that Kleenex is my support
I remember thinking, 'What will be put on my headstone?'
"Did they cry?""
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial exchange of words in the US-China trade war was intense, and while the war is still far from over, the border between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the future, the sources said.
US President Donald Trump first hit the market this year by imposing tariffs on all Chinese imports including steel, steel and panel products.
Added to this week's increase are tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), taxing half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has reversed the situation by imposing a 5 to 10 percent tax on goods worth up to $60 billion.
China has pledged to cooperate with the US at will, and the world's second-largest economy will not back down.
Making Washington flourish is a sign of submission, but bowing to the US would be the ultimate insult to Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader.
However, experts suggest that if Beijing is properly organized, the U.S. trade war could benefit China in the long run by reducing economic dependence on each other.
"The fact that it is a quick win for some in Washington or Beijing could create a series of potentially disruptive trade deals between the two countries that could pose the greatest threat ever", said Abigail Grace, a senior Asia researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said it is ready to welcome back refugees and is calling for a plan to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the world situation was improving.
"The country's current prosperity and security is the result of efforts to prevent crime", he said.
The government continues to repair the damage done by the terrorist attacks so that the land can be restored to its former glory.
There is every reason to believe that those who want to return to the country they left behind because of the violent attacks and the social problems that have affected their lives and the lives of their dependents.
The UN estimates that up to 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the interior of the country were in need of assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would accept any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But they have insisted that they will not accept any aid that will come in the next few months from the nations that supported the rebellion.
Europeans win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the USA by 16.5 to 10.5 tonnes at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US team has now played six consecutive European matches and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team was victorious when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 tons needed to beat the United States.
US champion Phil Mickelson, the winner of the event, took his tee shot in the water at the par-3 16th hole, defeated by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been one of the best players in the game, becoming one of only four players to have a perfect 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States lost 5-4 to the lowest ranked European, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World-renowned trainer Dustin Johnson lost by 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter in what appears to be his final Ryder Cup game.
One of the eight Ryder Cup champions, Spanishman Sergio Garcia, became the European record holder with a score of 25.5 tons.
"I used to cry, but now I can't help it.
This has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for accepting me and believing in me.
I am so happy to be able to lift the trophy again.
All the glory goes to the team, and I'm happy that I can help", said Garcia, who was overjoyed after winning the European championship.
He was giving strength to his friend John Ram who beat US golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in the individual all-around on Sunday.
"The biggest pride I feel, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods missed all four of his matches in France and currently has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
A difficult list for the world-famous catcher, who has won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team struggled all weekend to secure a spot except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had the best performance of the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disastrous game, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
There is a certain time in the morning when we are most vulnerable to the European.
We went upstairs.
A psalm to Thomas.
He is a powerful leader.
All 12 of his teams have done well.
We're going to work on it, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to move forward.
I am very fond of these 12 boys and proud to be their commander.
Give commendation when appropriate.
We are weary . . .
A note on the Red Tide: The low tide in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
New data from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicate a decline in the Red Tide population in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, declines are being reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - meaning that the numbers are declining.
The Red Tide runs 130 miles along the coast from the northern end of Pinellas to the southern end of Lee.
The fields can be found about 10 miles from the mainland of Hillsborough County, but they are smaller than they were this week.
The Red Tide is also visible in Pasco County.
A strong Pinellas County detection was reported last week, a low to high detection in coastal Hillsborough County, a strong detection in Manatee County, coastal Sarasota County, a weak detection in Charlotte County, a strong detection in coastal or Lee County, and a weak detection in Collier County.
Shocking reports of mass shootings have been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No collisions were reported in Northwest Florida last week.
