Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but it also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feather garment of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side, with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed coffin, the so-called spole, but instead have other features of feathers  rays and beams , the researchers concluded that the spool was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they were not used for flight but instead for temperature control or display purposes.
The researchers thought that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample on adult feathered animals shows, not young, dunes.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by forces reminiscent of tidal waters in the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Wintergate.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational force on Earth, causing tides, the Windy Road exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to find that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a kind of halo, and is made up of masses of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a crushed paper coffin with their chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the official verifies the identity of the voter, the voter shall place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voting document.
French electoral legislation codifies the approach quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot papers must be visible so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those duly counted by the competent voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process, and at night the votes are counted by volunteers under extensive supervision who follow specific procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue service cut the driver off from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be useless because her picture has been widely published.
This is common elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently and courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that ""journalists choose a dangerous line if they publish pictures etc. of suspects""".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made before prosecution.
According to the leak, the document is about the border dispute, where the Palestinians want the borders based on them before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects reported are the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel is requesting a 10-year permanent military presence in the valley after an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to leave such a presence for five years.
Hunting in the complementary pest control trial would be closely monitored by park rangers, as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, volunteers were recruited, under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS's associate director of park management and culture, the four shooters selected for the first shooting mission received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in as a new nine-member provisional electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional council election in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The violent protests were partly triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been postponed since 2011.
There have been reports of about 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (Meti) of Japan said 27 accidents related to the units were known.
"METI announced last week that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called ""fluffy""".
"The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Rescue Service said no injuries were reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by knocking down their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later switched seats with an older woman because she needed a toilet visit.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the fetal lung maturation.
"Xinhua reported that government investigators seized two black boxes" on Wednesday.
Co-defendants also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first boss, Luna died in the night with two moons, quite unique just like her, a strong woman.'"
"Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels said in a comment that ""Luna was a freak as big as I was... maybe even bigger... loves her and will miss her... hopefully she's better off where she is now"."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view that Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to have swam the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his hassle there have been doubts about his fitness.
He hasn't been able to take the medication needed to overcome his pain since they're banned from the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date, on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the earth's water resources, along with organic material, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and tramp".
There's speculation that he'll run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would mean the plane flies shorter distances, saves millions of liters of fuel each year, and reduces carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is introduced, and overland trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride stations are not available at ground level.
The fear of a lack of transportation opened the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer due to breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory Espa√±ola dairy finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire that can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
"It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called ""enlightened manuscripts"".
This is called the pH of a chemical.
The juice from the boiler changes in hue depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (since hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
You put the two dry powders together, then you shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel funny and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with drainage in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman society, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together.
When you call someone hundreds of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and field of view.
It takes a giant roof over 30 meters to get a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing that the wheel has done is give us much easier and faster transportation methods.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic animals) that eat a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job for every cat that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, and they live in large groups called flocks.
Flock consists of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and young.
The females are often closely related; a large family of sisters and daughters.
LeJob acts much like a herd of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-around athlete, the tiger can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same group (the Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but more like a phrase of roaring, screaming words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the ozelots follow and find animals to eat (change) through the smell, sniffing on the ground where they were.
They can see very well in the dark with their dark vision and also move very stealthily.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat), they often end up in a different environment than they used to be in.
This new environment has other resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population needs different functions or adaptations than they previously needed.
The indigenous population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce food by means of sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, and much of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain during his time, so it had nothing to fear except other mosasaurs.
The long jaws were occupied with more than 70 knife-edged teeth, along with an extra set of gum, meaning there was no chance of escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a cleft tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came down into the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was no match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their cut off portion of strange or unusual feasting items such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a kind of rodent called the hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor men and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked having banquets together where they could half-leap on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals may not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no cocoa, no potatoes, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which were considered to be the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to appease the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was accessible only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziqqurates, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special refuge for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outside.
Women cooked on the farm; shops were just open dishes facing the street.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was very precious.
Greenland was once the most populous, and Norse legends say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland as punishment for murder, and that when he traveled westward he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Whatever his findings, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
"Even though each country was ""Scandinavian"" there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland".
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, and even if it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears on the bottom of the document, up and down".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment (measuring 75.6 cm x 62.2 cm) was rolled together for storage early in its existence.
So it's likely that the text was just written there as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
"It was run by the French, the Vichy, who had made a deal with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and free French forces had liberated southern France and turned against Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture means knowledge being passed down through generations, a relentless cultural footprint, and a just spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it was up to the governments of the states, often unwilling to cooperate, to implement all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to abolish tax laws and customs between states.
The articles required unanimous approval from all the L√§nder before they could be added and the L√§nder attached so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
With its many islands, Japan is often counted geographically as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation of the original production of grain, and employed Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After the 1895 defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Declaration, granting sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still-image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more important is its image-to-image relationship inherited from the format of digital camera photosensors.
The 35 mm format is, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The final ratio in this format (divided by twelve to produce the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format) correspond to or are close to this image ratio.
The much-abused and often-laughed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a certain order in an image.
It is argued that the best location for the subject is where the lines dividing the image into thirds meet vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was examined.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united European states despite their differences in language and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the principal teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are for that very purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question the fulfillment of this principle.
Shortly after the conflict broke out, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in most international agreements over the past two hundred years.
Britain mined international water to prevent all ships from crossing entire areas of the sea, making it risky even for neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitude was pacifism and isolation among most inhabitants and countries.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, countries wanted to avoid a future like this.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to start working at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each stage in China's history, or each family that sat in power, was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period in which the provinces were divided, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms, which took place between the 60 years of the Han and Jind dynasties.
During these periods, violent warfare often raged between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history when thousands died in battle to take the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, the professions were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same is true of the military, where ranks within the army were now based on calibers rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to make a revolution.
"Muhammad was deeply interested in topics beyond his daily life. He often visited a cave known as the 'Hira' on the 'Noor' mountain (light) to meditate".
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave, located on one of the mountain peaks north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the kills of pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Death Valley contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tomb monuments, several temples, and the great sphinx".
The pyramid of Cheops was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The marking for ""up-line"" looks like a V and the marking for ""down-line"" like a clamp or a square that lacks a bottom side".
Up means you should start at the tip and push the beam upwards, and down means you should start at the fridge (where your hand holds the beam) and pull the beam downwards.
A high pitch usually generates a softer sound, while a low pitch is stronger and more resolute.
You may be happy to draw your own markings, but remember that the printed markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The well-known King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a pack of market women.
They returned to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their wagon windows open at the fork.
On one occasion, one of the mob participants waved his head from an imperial guard killed at Versailles, in front of the well-known frightened queen.
The war effort to conquer the Philippines by American imperialism was paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the cost and interest on bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the great gains resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the temple lords, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time period of the events is often called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 13th centuries.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the older Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many different ideas in practice, from that technology drives development or the technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is driven by a basic logic that is connected with the laws of nature and how they manifest in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a course that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are primitive, rather than socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that the motorized car will inevitably lead to the construction of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass transport of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical technologies to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of determinism originating in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, which harmonized with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily introduced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began to circulate around 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its influence declined during the 14th century, mainly because of the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 1100s and 1200s.
In the beginning, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication routes, Western styles could slow down by 25 to 30 years.
And by the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and one of the biggest developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using buttons to attach clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming carried out for the production of food sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family only.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses saved seeds originating in the ecoregion combined with interchangeability or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-employed, and so are many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society and allow them to find their identity.
Subcultures may be distinct by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be of a linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical nature, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic style choice, which includes fashion, manners, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during their upbringing.
"Such children are called 'wild.'" Some wild children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical disabilities".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wilderness on their own.
When the wild child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost identical to that specific pet, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, supporting education goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a support for individuals learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of support, but it's also the little gem-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalised in the software and is intended to challenge, guide and explain methods that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for many different reasons, from maltreatment to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring or educational, but it happens.
We believe the foster home system is a safe zone for these children.
Our family home system is to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster homes exist to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home they came from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of user theory.
"For example, ""learning"" and ""socialization"" are proposed as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995)."
"Even ""personal engagement"" and ""continuous relationships"" were identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites".
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
"Oliver Sacks showed in his book ""The President's Speech"" how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still judge sincerity correctly".
He even claims that we share such knowledge in interpreting human behavior with animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of pronounced variation.
Segregation and recombination discard variations back and forth between the two poles for each new generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from the plants available.
In addition, a lack of this has serious consequences; inhibited growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins found in leaves and bark, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are prepared.
By comparison, animal foods ( ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also offer high-quality proteins containing all essential amino acids.
"After all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today".
Sleep deprivation is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (1060 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you closer to consciousness without awakening you completely.
If you usually turn off the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other end of the room, so you have to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known liquid driver) before bed, which means having to get up and pee.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality of the present.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has expanded with the path of love in the Mahayana and many techniques in Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga is used to awaken kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The divine breath is central to Tibetan meditation, where the visualization of different gods cleanses the energy channels, activates the chakra, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, leading to a cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be physically fought by contract armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland and at the same time violating the Peace Agreement of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The most effective way of transporting large quantities of people and goods overseas is by using ships to transport goods.
The task of the fleet has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain in the same way as the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated only about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used them to produce milk, fur, meat and skin.
Tamets were usually kept in shots that roamed hills or other pasture areas, often chosen by shepherds who were often children or youths, similar to the more well-known shepherd.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, the horses that pulled them could reach higher speeds and carry greater loads than on slightly rougher roads at the time.
Sliders were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but gradually they realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a practice, but the iron was more on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago when Homo Erectus (meaning the upright man) saw the light of day.
Their predecessor, the australopithecus, was not used to walking upright.
Bipedal specialisations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have gone on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can get involved in the environmental movement, and we can also become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and disable it.
It is evident with all the desirable clarity that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have worsened because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
"Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon on the farm at Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 pages of Dunlap that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exist today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet of fleece and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their back legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers - or bits to use computer jargon.
Inner intoxication is not always immediately noticeable, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of poisoning could be an open jar of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bagger is used in formal sense by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient kinship with wall lice, insects that are sharply adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predatory bats and wall locusts are resident, adapted to live in their host's home or home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or for the benefit of their children, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to establish an adoption plan for their child.
During an adoption, the biological parents renounce their rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by the scientific method. In fact, this method is a guide in almost all research.
But it's not alone. Experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions and make observations, also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world found itself cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
A biological clock is a self-propelled oscillator that repeats its cycle for a period even in the absence of external influence.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They did two experiments that marked either the DNA in the substance with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the substance with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are sex cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of experiencing the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning more about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work and are passed by others whose destination for work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private transport.
Science now shows that this massive collectivity has disrupted the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human development for the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and uses transportation systems, and basically everyone complains about transportation systems.
In the developing countries, similar complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more basic happening?
Traffic flow is the study of how individual drivers and vehicles move between two points and how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the preparation of the traffic cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
As is well, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; thus traffic tends to flow somewhat consistently and can be largely presented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, three main variables have been linked: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful for the planning, design and operation of roadside installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid the enemy more easily and to find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't drop their wings are the wizarding lands and the day lands.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and the other stars).
This seems reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the world's largest river and the second longest river, with a water flow more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, 9 km wide in some places.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main course is 6,387 km long, and its water supplies thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and construction techniques of Giza never exceeded those of the pyramids.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican State are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemicals such as gold, silver, and copper, which can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four phases of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had theories that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Substances like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic substances such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit into the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a faithful companion to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pencil has been given a lower status and less use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, and they never have to get near a pencil eraser.
You can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to produce a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy carriage up a ridge, cracking the core again, releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and it doesn't take much to break down.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust, and the outer layers of the moon are called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick on this side and 100 km thick on the other side.
It's thinner under the moon and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner there, which made it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories revolve around finding out what motivates people or what appeals to them.
Theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they want and what their environment is that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's need hierarchy and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when bosses start to lead their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unknown person who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams hold the same high standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members tend to act as a point of contact for the physical group.
They often have more to say about than conventional team members, as different time zones can affect when their teams can meet and this may not be understood by management locally.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The invisible team is the management team that all members report to.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively in an organisation's functional departments, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a methodology used to support organisations in achieving higher performance.
Neurobiological information provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, making the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior supports researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, trauma, diseases, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have not seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that includes machine behavior, learning and intelligence.
AI research is about getting machines to automate data that requires intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and also hand gesture, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now widely used in economics, medicine, technology and the military, and has been built into several home computers and television game software applications.
Field studies are a major part of teaching in each classroom, and often the teacher wants to take the students to places where there are no buses.
Technology offers virtual study visits, allowing students to view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a study trip virtually is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital each year; the website is updated each year, but earlier versions may remain online as a book clip.
Blogging can also help improve student writing, and students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, which is generally improved by the presence of readers.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to write better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to become more aware of the world.The requirement to satisfy readers' interests stimulates students to be clicky and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet material, students can define their positions in relation to what others have written, as well as present their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital city and offers a range of galleries and museums that showcase Canada's present and past.
Further south lies Niagara Falls and to the north lies the beautiful, pristine nature of Muscovy.
All of this and more distinguishes Ontario with what outsiders consider to be the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are very sparsely populated, and some are nearly uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and most diverse continent in terms of fauna.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or part of France, and are known for their luxurious bathing grounds.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to the area, which had a major impact in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama circumnavigated the Godahoppsudden and thereby found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for someone to follow you, grab your arm, etc.
Be firm when you say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 1000s BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenians as a strategic port with the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city of Daru l-Badya, which was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a full range of creams, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located at the far easternmost point near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the central parts.
Goma is quite safe, but if you are visiting outside Goma, you should examine the situation in the northern province of Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest tracks of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to take a tour of Goma.
"Combined with its relative unavailability, ""Timbuktu"" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, remote places".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the biggest hits of the Henry Louis Gates PBS program Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country, with an atmosphere that is Arab rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which houses different wildlife.
It is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all other South African national parks, the park charges daily nature and entrance fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which either provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong have been likened to a glittering stack diagram reinforced by the water in Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the seafront of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's population is concentrated on the former seabed along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world and extends 80 km into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
However, the forests are not just mangrove forests  they contain some of the last remaining stands of the large jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is wetland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis shorts in the area.
Buses leave the district bus station (over the river) all day long, but most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
Bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and have two aisles that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free-standing height under the bridge is 15 metres.
The bridge is planned to be operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs stations are expected to be ready.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous people inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chacoregion was inhabited by other groups of native tribes such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived as hunters, gatherers, and fishermen.
"In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called the 'Great Province of India', was born as a result of the meeting of the Spanish conquerors and groups of the native indigenous people".
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is taking place in December at the Las Ca√±itas polo courts.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news and where you can buy tickets to polo matches, please contact the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
GBP is normally accepted throughout the islands, and within Stanley it is often convenient to pay by credit card and USD.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted in the remote islands, but British and American currencies can be accepted; contact the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; temperatures above +30¬∞C are common during the summer months
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
"There are no special ""rain"" and ""dry"" seasons: the rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year".
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wildlife!
No matter how delicate they may appear, bison, elk, candy bear, bear, and almost all large animals can be attacked.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep enough distance.
Also, consider that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been Samoa's official capital since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of the supreme commander Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because of Auckland's location between two ports.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most are shaded by the Maori.
Tamaki Drive's beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes well-attended family trends with a good selection of shops located on the beach.
"The main local beer is ""Number One"", which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for the trip.
The local drinking water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're concerned.
"For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is unknown. A 'short black' is 'espresso', a cappuccino has a heap of cream (not foam) and tea served without milk".
The hot chocolate milk meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made year round and damage from any of these causes on the reef is rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, listen to all signs and pay close attention to security warnings.
Kubmanets occur near beaches and near river mines from October to April 1770 in the north of the country.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The saltwater crocodile's main habitat is in the river mines north of Rockhampton, so they usually do not live in the sea.
Booking in advance gives the traveler security and assurance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, transfer to and from the airport, and even package travel that combines flights and hotels.
They may also reserve your booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain additional documents required for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, all changes and requests must first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors decide to camp on site, and most visitors see it as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be near where things are happening, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music performances on the main stage have ceased, parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campsites for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, because walking through ice causes really terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city.
Casinos usually do their best to get their guests to spend as much time and money as possible, often without windows or clocks, and often with difficulty finding the exit.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests cheerful and stay in the room.
Some establishments offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness makes people's reputations worse, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should be aware of the possibility of snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive the same way you can on bar asphalt.
In a very short time, during a snowstorm, there can be enough snow to get you stuck.
The visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowfall or by condensation or ice on the vehicle window.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues almost continuously year round.
Safari is perhaps the largest tourist industry in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling across the country to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to come close to cars, and with standard equipment, they can be seen well.
Lions, ducks, and leopards are sometimes shady and are best seen with a gazebon.
"Walk safari (also called a "bush walk" or "hiking safari") consists of walking for a few hours or for several days".
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place at other venues around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policies due to the coronavirus look different, but by the end of March most will not extend as far as July 2020, when the Olympics were supposed to have begun.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a typical ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a sewing machine and a sewing board that can be borrowed even if they do not have it in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you do not want to wear stretched socks, try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases sweat).
There are different sets of water purifiers, and some are more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters can vary in efficiency, and if you're unsure, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from an established company.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by violence, are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the ability to buy goods without taxes or other supplements in certain places.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable sum, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh National Road, which often passes through isolated woodland.
If you are not used to driving on the highway, drive with reason: slopes, narrow driving fields, and curves are common.
The speed limits set are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph) - and their compliance is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely enough, mobile coverage is much better here than along many other tracks, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are really good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, similar to those from their neighbor in the south, Austria.
Fruit baked goods are common, with apples baked in baked goods all year round, and cherries and plum in summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want small but powerful pastries, try what is known as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either ""dry"" or ""wet"" depending on the amount of liquid".
In the northern Indian and Pakistani inland regions, yogurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a collective name that includes a wide variety of regional dishes spread across the country.
However, when used without a noun, the term tends to mean food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the region, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the most commonly used flavoring ingredients being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stairs support the rider's feet, which hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but can pose a safety risk as the rider's feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown by a horse but is stuck with one foot in the stairwell, he may be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English ones, have safety bars that ensure that a saddle slide is detached from the saddle if pulled back by a rider falling off.
The Cocham√≥ Valley, Chile's main climbing destination, is known as South America's Yosemite, and has a number of large rocks and granite walls.
Mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all corners of the world are constantly creating new routes among the countless mountain walls.
Outdoor activities, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which skis or snowboarding are used to glide down a snow-capped landscape.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiasts, sometimes called "skid lovers", who plan their entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular area.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5,000 B.C.!
Exercise as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was opened by Norsemen in Australia.
Ski backpacking: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or ski hiking.
It is related to but usually does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being done in steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a slightly greater distance than on walks  but you will rarely reach speeds like long-distance skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries, and under normal circumstances travelling through several countries would require a number of visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions roughly like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without passing through multiple checks.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen Member State separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques, and some tax authorities define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where age limits may be shorter in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are not as old as similar mass-produced goods.
The clean-meat industry is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other occupations.
Historically, however, not all Samis have been involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using the reindeer mostly as reptiles.

For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may have different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
A travel advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The image presented is often fast, general and simple compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause harm, serious social disturbances or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are variations depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and flashes of lightning are the types and consequences of extreme weather, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe snowstorms, professional weather, ice storms and sandstorms.

Transgender persons who have not undergone surgery shall not expect to be able to pass the X-ray with integrity and dignity preserved.
Rip currents are the recurrent flow of waves breaking off at the beach, often at a reef or similar.
Underwater topology allows the flow back to concentrate into a few deeper parts, and strong currents leading to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion after trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get stuck again or, depending on your skills and whether you've been discovered, wait to be rescued.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (there is not as much of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have had a difficult time adjusting to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adjust to their original culture.
When you return from abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramid Sound and Light Show is one of the most interesting things for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.

The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula, the largest island being King George Island with the community of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded crater of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth's land is the region south of the peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merge here with the plateau and then return to form the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, which is shared across the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif, with a summit of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.

Finland is very boat-friendly, and the country of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the archipelago.
In the archipelago and the lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelago and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any pleasure hunt, smaller boats or even a kayak can offer a different experience.
Boat life is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seventh or eighth person.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most specific Baltic cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days while returning to sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fear and reluctance to do other things that a lot of people have.
Understanding how airplanes operate and what happens during a flight can help some people overcome a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly, and often time is very important when it comes to business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If they have sent goods by air, it may have taken several days on some routes to go through unloading and customs.
The only way to get there faster was to send the checked baggage, because airline rules don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you get the picture.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to spend a lot of money on the privilege (or even better, let your company do it for you).
However, this does not come at a cheap price: as a gross rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy price for business and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is not even a good idea to look for discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travellers who are willing to pay well for the privilege of travelling anywhere quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is common.

Rare animal species such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, rhinoceros, wildcat and thistle are found there, along with many more common species
When visiting the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees, and also have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries give scarves to women who have not prepared in advance, but if you bring one of your own, especially one of bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
The same logic says men must wear pants that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the warehouse in the entrance but the clothes are not washed after each person so you may not feel comfortable wearing these dresses.
Mallorcan food, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially beef) and uses olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and optional accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the pronoun Sie, are written in capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
