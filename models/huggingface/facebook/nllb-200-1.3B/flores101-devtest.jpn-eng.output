When a small group of living things (a small number of individuals) are separated from the larger group to which they belong (e.g. by moving across mountains and rivers or to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
Because different resources and different competitors exist in this new environment, new populations may need different characteristics and adaptations from those they previously needed, and may become powerful competitors.
The original population is not quite the same, and still needs adaptation as much as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to a new environment, over time, it begins to show a different appearance from other populations.
Eventually, thousands or millions of years later, two different groups will look as different as the same species.
This process is called species formation, which simply means the formation of a new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

Japan has about 7,000 islands, the largest of which is in the state of Honshu, and is considered the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is a collection of islands, so it is geographically often called "群島".
The origin of Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors called the island "イルハ・フォルモサ" ("美しい島")
1624 The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the native grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
1683年清朝 ((16441912年) the army occupied the coastal parts of western and northern Taiwan, and declared that Taiwan would become a province of the清国 in 1885.
1895 year, after the defeat of the first daylight war (1894-1895) the Qing government signed the Treaty of the Downward Relations and ceded Taiwan to Japan.

For example, the most popular still photography film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the mainstream film size at the end of the analog film era.
They are still in production today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio inherits the image sensor format of digital cameras.
紛らわしいですが、35 mm判は実は幅36 mm、高さ24 mmのサイズである。
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this form (12 in divided by the simplest integer) is 3:2.
Most of the generic records (e.g., APS systems records) are either equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
"三分割法" (三分割法) is a simple design that creates dynamics while preserving the order of the images, as some people may dismiss it as trivial.
The most effective position for the main subject to be positioned is the one in which the image is surrounded by the intersection of the divided line, divided into horizontal and horizontal sections of 3/1.
The Catholic Church, which had become a powerful and economically rich force in European history, was likely to be the target of a severe eye in this era.
Christianity has for over a thousand years united the nations of Europe with different languages and customs.
Its universal power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the purpose of alleviating suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are a special existence for that purpose.
The central power of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money had led many to question whether its doctrine was being fulfilled.
Soon after the start of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was effective, blocking the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
The British even threatened neutral ships in the open sea to prevent ships from entering the entire sea area.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany assumed a similar response in its unlimited water battles.
The ideas that were prevalent in most citizens and states in the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
Countries that witnessed the tragedy and cruelty of war during World War I hoped that they would not be in a similar situation again in the future.

In ancient China, there was a unique way of showing the time difference, and the various stages of Chinese history, or the dynasties that held power, became the distinctive dynasties.
There were also unstable periods of unstable, divided territories between the various dynasties. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years.
In these times, many noble families were waging a fierce battle for the throne.
三国志は, was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people fought in the struggle for the highest position in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
The adoption of the Metrology, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, the love of country, and the belief that the state is not the sole ruler but belongs to the people, had many social and political effects.
After the revolution, the profession and the public recruitment system became established, with all men eligible to apply, and the most ambitious and successful were allowed to take up the position.
The same can be said of the army; for if so, then the army has become a class based on ability rather than a class based on rank.
The French Revolution stimulated many of the oppressed working classes in other countries, and revolutions began in other countries.
ムハンマドは, was deeply interested in issues beyond the everyday life. He frequently visited the cave called "ヒーラ" in the mountain of "ヌール" (光) for meditation.
The caves that have survived beyond the ages clearly reflect the spiritual decline of the muhammad.
The cave is located on the top of a hill in the north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy to find a cave even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, it is a completely isolated space.
Nothing is visible except the beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, the outside is barely visible and the outside sounds are not heard.
The Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still extant.

On 6 October 1789, the fearful King Louis XVI, the Queen, Marie Antoinette, and two young children, and the King's sister, Princess Elizabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from the Palace of Versailles by the women of the marketplace, who had become thugs.
They rode back to Paris, surrounded by a mob, which shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd of people, which was made up of thugs, forced the king and queen to open the windows of their car.
Once, in the presence of the terrified queen, one of the mobs shook the heads of the Royal Guard, who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The cost of the conquest of the Philippines in the American imperialist war was borne by the Filipinos.
They were forced to withhold taxes from the American colonial government to cover most of their spending, and to pay interest on bonds sold in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
Of course, the surplus profits from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would have been the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand テンプル騎士団, you need to understand the context in which the order was born.
The period in which this event occurred is called the Middle Ages, and is generally considered to correspond to the period of 11th century (12th century) and 13th century (1300) in European history.
The Middle Ages are considered as a historical epoch-division between the pre- and late medieval periods, and it is customary to consider the late Middle Ages as ending by 1500. 
Technological decision-making is a term that actually encompasses a wide range of ways of thinking, from the beginning of technological advancement or the technological norm, to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological decision-making theory share two general views: one that the development of technology itself has gone beyond cultural and political influence, and the other that technology is not socially conditioned, but rather "influences" the society within it.
For example, one might say that 自動車 is inevitably linked to the development of roads.
However, since a handful of cars alone cannot account for the entire national road network, new production methods have been developed to lower the overall cost of cars.
The increase in car ownership will lead to an increase in road accidents, and as a result, new technologies for treating injured bodies will be developed in the medical field.
Romanism had a large element of cultural determinism, which was formed by the writers of the ゲーテ,フィヒテ,シュレーゲルらの 『Romanism』.
In the Romantic context, geography formed the individual, and over time there arose customs and cultures connected with it, which were superior to the laws imposed by society and its institutions.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, so too was Constantinople the fashion center of Europe during the feudal era.
The reputation as a center of 豪奢的服装的名声は、紀元400年起開始、紀元1100年頃まで続きました。
By the 12th century, its status declined, mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, more valuable than in the Byzantine market.
It was during this time that the prestige as a center of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The most important period of Gothic style was the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
The original appearance was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of the slow pace of communication, Western European styles may be 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own distinctive style.One of the greatest advances of the time as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to wrap clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a form of agriculture that produces only the food necessary for the subsistence of the agricultural worker and his family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple system that maximizes yields by combining conserved seeds, round crops and other relatively simple techniques that are self-sustaining in the ecosystem area, and in many cases organic agriculture.
Historically, most farms have been self-sufficient, and this trend is still evident in many developing countries.

One of the most common ways of showing the importance of socialization is to cite a few unfortunate examples of children whose social adaptation was hindered by adults during their growth by: 育児放棄、不運、 or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "野生児" or "フェラルキッド". 野生児は人 (((usually by their own親) are sometimes imprisoned, and sometimes the reason for such abandonment is the refusal of the parents to foster children with severe intellectual・physical disabilities.
野生児は、捨てられたり、逃亡する前、重度の児童虐待やトラウマを経験している可能性がある。
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and others are said to have lived independently in the wild.
Wild children raised and raised by non-human animals, such as those who are afraid of humans or indifferent to humans, show almost the same behavior as the animal within the physical range.
Learning in project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, but scaling is 1 step ahead.
スキャフォールド is not a learning method, it is meant to support people using new computer programs, starting new projects, or having new learning experiences。
スキャフォールディング has both virtual and real modes.言い換えに,、教師はスキャフォールディングの形態の一形態であり、Microsoft Officeのクリップ人形も同様である。
The Virtual Scaffold is integrated into the software and is intended to enable students to ask, instruct, and explain procedures that may be difficult for one person.
The reasons why children are placed in the foster care system are varied, from abandonment of the child to abuse and even intimidation.
Any child should be raised in an environment with proper care, education, and nurturing, but wild children are raised in an environment without it.
We recognize that the 里親制度 is a safe haven for these children.
The 里親制度 is meant to provide a secure family、 a loving childbirth、 a secure education、 a reliable healthcare.
The 里親制度, or the 里親 system, is meant to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the household before the withdrawal.
The Internet is a combination of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to a further dimension from the point of view of the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been suggested as important motivators for Internet use. (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as a new aspect of motivation when Eighmey & McCord (1998) investigated viewer responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has been linked to important discoveries in interpreting facial expressions, which last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, they claim that by correctly interpreting a facial expression, one can tell whether the person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", points out that people with brain disorders who cannot understand speech can correctly evaluate honesty.
He suggests that such a capacity to interpret human behavior is also common to animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two gene pools between hidden and expressed genetic variation.
By sudden mutation, the addition of a new genetic mutation, or elimination, is removed from the pool of mutations it has manifested.
Inhabiting and conversion, we shed the variation, moving back and forth between the two pools in each generation.
For primates with a human-like digestive system, it is difficult to obtain essential amino acids from plant resources available in savannah environments.
And, neglect of it can lead to serious problems such as growth suppression, malnutrition, etc., and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources were the proteins found in leaves and beans, which are nutrients that are difficult for primates like us to digest without cooking.
Whereas, 、動物性食品 ((アリ、シロアリ、卵) is a good protein source that contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it's no wonder that our ancestors might have solved the "protein problem" in the same way as today's savannah-dwelling chimpanzees.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time for a short period of time and then falling asleep.
This can be facilitated by using a relatively quiet alarm clock and returning consciousness without waking up completely.
If you notice that you are unconsciously stopping the alarm, there are ways to put the clock on the other side of the room or make sure that you can't stop it unless you get out of bed.
Other measures based on the biorhythm are to make the situation that you cannot get up before urinating, etc.
The degree of tension of the human mind, or the degree of mental or physical tension, is in the opposite relation to the degree of tension of the body or spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is born. Everyone has the potential ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can develop enlightenment. The only thing that can prevent this goal is one's own anxiety or negative feelings.
Although Tibet Buddhism is a belief based on the teachings of Budda, it has been expanded to incorporate many techniques from the compassion and yoga of the Great Buddhist Order and the Indians.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the Kundali-ni-yoga, meditation, and the path of love.
クンダリーニヨガは、ヨガのポーズ、呼吸、マントラ、ムードラ etc. combined withクンダリーニ ((自己の魂) さんの覚醒を狙うもの。
The center of Tibetan meditation is the divine yoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channel is purified, the chakra is activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, and the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated; after the war, the two countries became antagonistic, due to conflicts of institutions, processes, and cultures.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It then continued for 40 years, and real battles were fought by proxy armies in the battlegrounds from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, etc.;
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the route of the Hagia Sophia in Romania.
However, these plans almost overnight became a thing of the past. More than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army, after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Rigaga講和条約, ソビエト・ポーランド不可侵条約, and other international treaties, formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian lines.
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport people and goods in bulk across the sea.
Traditionally, the Navy's task was to ensure that while maintaining its ability to transport its own nationals and supplies, it would also effectively interfere with the ability of the enemy to transport its own nationals and supplies.
The most notable recent example is the North Atlantic Operation of World War II. The United States attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was primarily using Uboats to try to prevent this transportation.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would probably have been able to conquer England as well as the rest of Europe.

The direct ancestors of the Australopithecus did not have the habit of continuing to walk upright for more than a certain time.
サヘラントロプス may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the characteristics of the two-foot walk are confirmed in the fossil of 390-42 million years ago australopithecus.
You can start a more environmentally friendly life, you can join an environmental movement, you can become an activist to alleviate some of the future suffering.
In many cases, this is like a counter-therapy. However, we need not only to seek a temporary solution, but also to identify the root cause of the problem and deactivate it.
It is a sufficiently obvious fact that the world has been greatly changed by the advancement of humanity in science and technology, and that the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and luxurious living.

The main purpose of science is to explain the workings of the world by scientific methods. Indeed, this method has been the guideline for most scientific research.
But, this is not all. Experiment is a test used to rule out more than one possible hypothesis, and asking or observing questions can also be a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid particular attention to classical books, especially the Bible written in Latin.
The accepted view was that Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were the same.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western nations realized that they were cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are often decisively dependent on the existence of an endogenous cycle and the patterns that are recorded through the body clock.
The cyclical rhythm is not merely a response to cyclical patterns from outside, but is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, etc.;
A body clock is an independent amplifier that circulates freely for a certain period of time without any external signals.
The Hacey and Chase experiment was one of the most powerful experiments to suggest that DNA is genetic material.

They tried two experiments, one to mark phage DNA with radioactive zinc, and the other to mark phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
A sudden mutation, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the missing part of the affected genetic material, whether the affected cell is a reproductive cell, may have a variety of different effects.
Only mutations in the reproductive cells are passed on to the offspring; mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism focused on contact with nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying landscapes including wild fauna and flora.

In this dynamic back-and-forth transport, everyone is connected in some way to the transport system based on their own cars and supports it.
Science has shown that the biosphere has now been pulled out of one of the stable states that have supported human evolution for the last two million years by this massive carbon economy.
Anyone who lives a social life uses transportation. Almost everyone is dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In the advanced countries, we hardly hear complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why does the transportation system create such complaints and breakdowns on a daily basis; is it just the transportation engineers who are incompetent; or is there a more fundamental problem?
交通流研究 is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles and their interaction between them in the period between 2 point.
Unfortunately, because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% probability, it is difficult to study traffic flow.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency, which can be expressed mathematically roughly.
To more accurately represent the traffic flow, a correlation between the three main characteristics of traffic flow, namely, (1) flow, (2) density, (3) speed, has been established.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and operating road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly in the air helped them avoid enemies and find prey and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are able to fold their wings along their body.
This widened the scope of narrow places to hide from predators.
Now, the insects that cannot fold their wings are only in the form of a tongue and a tail.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Aristotle said that the solar system moves around the sun.
While some accepted his theory as correct, many believed the opposite, that in the solar system the Sun and other stars moved around the Earth.
I don't feel the earth moving, so this seems logical to me 😉

The basic chemical elements, such as 金,銀,銅, are known to have been prized by humans since ancient times, and both can be found in nature in their natural forms and can be relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, fire.
This is close to the 4態 (この順) of solid, liquid, air, body, and plasma, but his theory also held that they change into new matter and form what is seen in this world.
