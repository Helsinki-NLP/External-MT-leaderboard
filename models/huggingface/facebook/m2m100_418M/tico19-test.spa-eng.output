Incidence of rapidly increasing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulated incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) demonstrates similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the UK, which confirms that, although in different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention that the causing agent was a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined the trends in the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (RU) and compared them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with the case in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5th Eurosurveillance 2020 edition, Spiteri et al. the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
By March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the UK (RU), according to which between December 31, 2019 and that date even, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths were recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and accumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the reports of COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to examine the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the accumulated incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated at 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases in each country by 15 March 2020, at 8:00 p.m., compared to that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The trends in the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then increased considerably close to February 28 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all the other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed upward trends of the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 similar (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK, compared to that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It emphasizes that on March 15 at 8:00 p.m., another 15 EU/EEA and UK countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is the case despite the different stages in which the countries are located, the variations in national public health answers and, possibly, the different case definitions in the countries and the different protocols to select the patients to submit the test to confirm the COVID-19, including the delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (the data is not shown).
However, it should be systematically collected to complement the current surveillance data that focus on the number of cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a great variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12,5 intensive care beds and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of the medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk of >90% overcoming of the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s fast risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, cases have been formed in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the UK, and that hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional capture population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as what is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC’s quick risk assessment, it is essential to adopt a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to one mitigation approach, since the expected rapid increase in the number of cases possibly does not give the decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The quick risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients who need intensive care over the coming days and weeks.
The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the deaths of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homological virus, the SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the mucus and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmitted and affects more older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and complete analysis of the research topic, which is developing quickly.
We will treat the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have no answer yet, we hope this analysis will help understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard and unbeatable memory for all Chinese, who were instructed to stay at home throughout the festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to 50 more countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients given high and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number one” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report of January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the advances in research on this new subject that is developing quickly.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronavirus has traditionally been considered non-letal pathogens for humans, which mainly cause around 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we’ve met twice with highly pathogenic coronavirus in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible mortality and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus that has been recorded in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, unknown-born pneumonia conglomerates were first on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was announced.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, the infection was from healthcare providers, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was put into quarantine and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the source of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries around the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic that is described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but primarily people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0,31/100 000) than women (0,27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (IC of 95 %: 3.51-4,05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 % (IC of 95 %: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of the total of patients was 3.06 % (IC of 95 %: 2.02-4,59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large and surrounded viruses that contain a single-sensitive chain ARN.
They can be divided into four genes, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alfacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope connects to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converter enzyme and the dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membran fusion occurs.
The genome of viral ARN is released to the cytoplasma; after the replication of the viral genome, the genome of ARN, along with the glucoproteins of the embrace and the proteins of the nucleocapside, forms vesicles that contain virions, which then fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered as a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan sea market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-long sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was determined that human ACE2 is a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 connects to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is congruent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secreted protein coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 electronic cryomicroscopy structure in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the carrier amino acid B0AT1.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, assembled as a dimer, and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can combine two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic diana for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Origin and the Intermediate Guest
It is known that the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV originated in murciellages and were transmitted to humans through the civets and camels, respectively.
In a philogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in a 96% to two coronavirus similar to the SARS of coronavirus called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate guest helped the virus cross the barrier of the species to infect humans, and remains diluted the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed the serpents as the carrier of the worms virus to humans, which implicated the homological recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-hoc mammals that are feeding from worms and commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference spread by the whole of two genoms remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, ethanol at 75%, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloropharm and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
Until now, no detailed study on the immunity response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognized by the guest's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectine receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturity of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptative immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies for the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
Cooperative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytocins to help defensive cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T cells by inducing apoptosis of the T cells.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system generates locally a lot of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst of the cases, multiorganic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbilities and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a lot of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to get infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average and oscillated from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarentine time depending on the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected normally should stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine extend to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia a week after the occurrence of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung anomalies in image studies, should be tested for a early diagnosis.
A demographic study of late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dysnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparable, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98 %), dry cough (47 %) and dysnea (55 %) as main symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them needed respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in consonance with the highest MERS mortality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dysnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed approximately in 14% to 20% of patients.
For February 14, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66.576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10 percent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and elevated to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only oscillated between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
Previous figures suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of these two latter.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise.
Patients usually have history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to the appearance.
However, it has been that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospitalized patients can regain the virus, a alarm signal that the quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cells count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocytes count of <1×109/l, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and reactive C protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the degradation of the fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the count of lymphocytes was gradually reduced.
Abnormalities are detected in the chest radiographies of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in smaragd glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes disfunction decrease the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in the chest radiographies are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the discamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hialine membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstice, and multinucleated sintial cells in the lungs of a patient who died due to the disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral and SDRA infection, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection by a chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlite of sample) using a graduated vary in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was also proposed to use the plasma of recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, in a smaller degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the greatest threat for patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorpore membrane oxygenation assistance (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used for the treatment of potentially deadly heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organs functions are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytocin storm is the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytocin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytocins, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of SDRA and multiorganic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of citochin storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 monoclonal anti-receptor antibody, have been used to treat the citochin storm.
Other immunosuppressing treatments for citochin storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a suppressor of path 4 of citochin signaling, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressors, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lungs in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis notably.
However, prudent use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses for a short period has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the date of this analysis, the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, intraveneously administered, has been proven to a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary ARNs, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China for a couple of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, alpha interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirine have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combined lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibodies generation
Blood extraction from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contrae the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for its large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate the immune response and cause cytocin release syndrome, which possibly produces a deadly toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with the fast enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of the recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that codify effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects greatly depend on a combination of several components in a formula that vary according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of the MCT.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that the capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and the capsules of Lian Hua Qing Wen are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used MCT in 87 % of their patients, among them, Gansu (63.7 %), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT in just around 30 % of their COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 %).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study in which Western medicine treatment (MO) was compared only to combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They discovered that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were notably smaller in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising, the rate of symptoms worsening (from mild to severe) was notably lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% against 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (8.8% against 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT are still waiting for more well-controlled trials at greater scales and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of the MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of the highly contagious and even mortal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities were, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health answers to COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health should be paid to patients with COVID-19, people with suspicion and people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public who needs it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
They are essential effective vaccines to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible guests, and usually complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with alienated living viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these possible vaccines in older people and the lethal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic viral infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS was extinct 17 years ago and no new case has been recorded since then.
Instead, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months in average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and to the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As it is a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequences.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease forecast model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (table (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also suitable for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years old in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbilities and complications and were considerably larger than those who did not require them (with an average age of 66 against 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor of the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0,31/100 000 against 0,27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbilities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arithmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been to be associated with ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Anormal laboratory results: the level of reactive C protein (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It has also been proposed the correlation between the level of PCR and the gravity and forecast of the COVID-19.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine cinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's evolution.
These enzymes are expressed intensely in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: thorax radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical developments and complications of COVID-19.
Using steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered an extraordinary stress, as they generally suffered long periods of quarentine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close family members and other patients.
It is indispensable to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to demographic studies done so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than that of the SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection, as is the case with other coronavirus that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in early stages or in incubation period can produce a lot of viruses during their daily activities, which greatly makes it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while the transmission mostly did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, which include the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost all the population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are generating a remarkable damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the slowdown of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the descending phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not be completed in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the recently identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the flu.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies might be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through a strict quarent and isolation, the disease has been managed to be controlled.
It is possible that, like the SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infectiousness and eventually extins or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted through cough or stroke, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the feces, which poses a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases that 41% of the cases were likely to have been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even transitors in contact with patients or people infected.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (serious number 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgery masks prevent a potentially infected person’s fluid drops from being transmitted through the air or attached to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (serious number 1860) can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of virions can completely penetrate them; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five applied surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (serie number 1860) and not the surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, health care providers should use custom-made insulation paths in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected himself with SARS-CoV-2 despite having used a N95 mask; it is possible that the virus has entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective carets or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with desinfectant soap more followed than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit the contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with the SARS-CoV, as on January 7, 2020, should have caused great warning in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center calmed citizens saying that the new virus had a low contagiosity and a limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain the disease.
This message notably relieved the alarm of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Party, and the critical moment was missing to contain the disease at a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public advertisements, since each word matters to citizens and can make them change their attitude or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinics, instead of waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in its early stage, instead of trying to calm the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulacros to increase the public awareness about epidemic diseases and test and improve the society response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of the COVID-19 and the SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the feeling of reappearance of the SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women, and gravity and mortality are also higher in older people than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% against 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they do not present any symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do it when they are seriously sick, which generates a much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may give negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can give positive on the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spread.
Given the rapid advances in the research of COVID-19, several important issues remain to be solved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between the SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus, it is not yet possible to conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 comes from the SARS.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, let’s say, the worms, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to efficiently stop the transmission, and the outbreak can resurrect at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how exactly the virus enters the respiratory cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also connect to the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment cannot be achieved.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it is transmitted among humans?
Will it become a world pandemic, extinct like SARS, or recur periodically like flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, as much as it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronavirus and its guests, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus caused mild diseases, such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have invested the currency in revealing how devastating and deadly a coronavirus infection can be in humans.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put coronavirus at the center of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and a reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, the SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most coronavirus in humans have their origin in myrsels, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reserve guests of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications in the prevention of diseases in humans.
Researching the interactions between coronavirus and guests in animals could, in addition, throw important information about the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven coronavirus of humans, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and on the transmission between species.
Noteably, we compare and contrast the different coronavirus of humans from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the virus's evolution in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of positive monocatenary ARN viruses with embrace.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, of 26 to 32 kilobases, among the ARN viruses, were named “coronavirus” due to their morphology, by the form of the crown they have under an electronic microscope.
As for their structure, coronavirus have non-segmented genoms that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicase polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are processed even more to generate 16 non-structure proteins, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), embrace (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins of each line are also coded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronavirus is classified into four genres (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genres of the betacoronavirus contain most human coronavirus and is subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The philogenetic evidence has demonstrated that worms and rednesses are the source of genes for most alfacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reserve for gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronavirus has constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, seven coronavirus are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 normally cause mild symptoms, such as common colds or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through exhaustive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a raw mortality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to a persistent epidemic on the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which has covered more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is approaching.
The seven coronavirus of humans have a zoonotic origin in mushrooms, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all coronavirus in humans, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogenic, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the driving force and the restrictive factors of the jump between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate guests and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which would have significant implications in the prevention of spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenesis of human coronavirus.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common topic that human coronavirus parental viruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but they become pathogens after the transmission between species to a new guest.
We also examine the evolution trend of human coronavirus, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E’s B814 strain was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals, such as spider, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first species of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966 and, subsequently, adapted to grow in WI-38 lungs cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented common cold symptoms, such as headache, turmoil, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and the subsequent serial pass in breast mouse brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other pathogens of the respiratory tract, such as the influenza A viruses and the rinovirus.
Both the HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immune compromised patients had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as “atypic pneumonia”, caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first SARS case dates back to late 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from superpropagators, it was calculated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and colds, followed by dysnea, cough and breathing difficulties as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and high levels of creatine quinase are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytocin storm, which could be fatal, in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was isolated for the first time from the open-air lung biopsy of a family of the initial patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to the research of human coronavirus.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month boy from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immune-compromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corrose, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from a 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in the early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, the HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in the community, it was that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found around the world and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronavirus acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred by unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been to have caused serious infection of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when these human coronavirus acquire the ability to be effectively transmitted and continuouslyined in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, cases imported with occasional contagion to close contacts have been recorded in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
Clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal insufficiency, which so far only is given with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were recorded, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans of which it is known.
From mid to the end of December 2019, conglomerates of pneumonia patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and, in addition, called the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a raw mortality of 3.4%.
Notoriously, the mortality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly evolve to acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotid sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized in different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been, which could contribute to their rapid spread around the world.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six coronavirus in humans, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is located between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronavirus acquired in the community (i.e., the HCoV-229E, the HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 and the HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, which includes the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as it happens with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic both of human coronavirus acquired in the community and of SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmission of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like with other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fulfills an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still dilute in future studies.
It is also of special interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 could show seasonality, as is the case of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after passes among humans, will have an influence on the final development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronavirus acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronavirus.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemies.
Human coronavirus that causes serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases by human coronavirus have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, human coronavirus must be replicated in humans in a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptative mutations that contradict guest restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infect, the greater is the likelihood that it completely adapts to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop through quarent or other measures of infection control.
For many years, the four coronavirus acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unstable.
They need to keep and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human goals, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as the four human coronavirus acquired in the community.
It is highly transmitted as human coronavirus acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronavirus acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, it will be useful for us to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reserve guests, intermediaries and amplifiers of human coronavirus.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a coronavirus of humans if it houses a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reservoir guest hosts a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of human coronavirus or their parental virus.
Instead, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate guest just before or almost at the same time as it was introduced into humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the amplifier guest function by allowing the virus to transitory replicate and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal guest if it cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the contrary, human coronavirus can also adapt to the intermediate guest and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial SARS case had been in contact with hunting animals.
Later research on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Paguma larvata and a mapache dog in living animals markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets of the markets.
However, it was that wild or farming palm coves without exposure to the markets of living animals were mostly negative on SARS-CoV, suggesting that palm coves only would act as intermediate amplifier guest, but not as a natural reserve of the SARS-CoV.
Noteably, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as SARS-CoV amplifier intermediate guests cannot be discarded.
They all seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of the SARS-CoV revealed a closely related worm coronavirus, called Rhinolophus worm HKU3 related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese worms.
These worms are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other worm coronavirus share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with the SARS-CoV.
These studies have set the basis for the new concept that murciellages host emerging pathogens in humans.
Various coronavirus similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in worms, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converter enzyme is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of mushrooms uses the ACE2 of mushrooms, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Surprisingly, serums of convalecient SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
Until now, the WIV1 represents the closest-related ancestor of SARS-CoV in murcilages, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of the SARS-CoV and that the worms are not the immediate reserve host of the SARS-CoV.
According to the philogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the MERS-HKU4 and the MERS-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, the dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
MERS-CoV's ARN-dependent polymerase ARN sequences are philogenetically closer to their betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, a MERS-CoV can not be found alive in wild wheels.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the MERS-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of just 87%.
Therefore, the murciélago might not be the MERS-CoV’s immediate reserve guest.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, just like camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedarians, which supports even more that the camels act as MERS-CoV's bona fide reserve guests.
Also, it is worth noting that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notoriously, infected camels spread the viruses not only by respiratory, but also by fecal-oral, which is also the main pathway of spread of viruses from the worms.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the appearance of the symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to transmission between humans or to unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that host the MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a rhinolophus affinis coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence divergence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, worms may not be the immediate reserve guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future coronavirus of virtually identical worms.
Presumably, the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal guests should be among the wild species that are sold and killed on the wholesale market in Huanan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of transmission from animal to human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals in danger, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomas of this new pangoline coronavirus share a 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like viral sublines in the philogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor connection domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In marked contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study on sick pangolins also the detection of viral contiges in lung samples, which appear to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised around 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot discard the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of the SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin due to the sequence divergence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin beta-coronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin beta-coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of the SARS-CoV-2 in worms, pangolins and other mammals is still to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin, the betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 share the highest full genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the pangolin beta-coronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between the beta-coronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wildlife.
As an impulse force in evolution, recombination is spread among the betacoronavirus.
No conclusion has yet been made about the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronavirus, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
The philogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from coronavirus, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses have been found in roots.
It was that a coronavirus named ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches mountains) detected in a tricolor mountains in North America had a close relationship with the HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to another coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camellids as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge you have to date of the animal origins of the known human coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of transmission of coronavirus from humans among species in history.
When the HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The background of transmission between species of the HCoV-229E is not so accurately known.
Alfacoronavirus has been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is a alfacoronavirus of alpacas.
Various lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from worms to humans directly.
First of all, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with murciellag in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, the HCoV-229E-related alfacoronavirus are diverse and non-pathogenic in the alfacoronavirus, while the alfacoronavirus of the alpacas caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alfacoronavirus of alpacas has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be discarded the possibility that alpacas acquire the alfacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, worms are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as anger virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising that the worms transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while the alfacoronavirus of murciellae act as the genetic asset of HCoV-229E, the alpacas and dromedarians could act as intermediate guests that transmit the viruses to humans, in particular in the case of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from murciellages to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV in the murciellages, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that the murciellages contribute, with a profound acervo of viral species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
The longevity, densely populated colonies, the narrow social interaction and the great ability to fly, are all favourable conditions that make murciellag the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced in the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have passed from being an intermediate guest, to being a stable and natural reserve guest.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease andins a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal host of the MERS-CoV, since the transmission is unstable.
Compared to the role of the camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolines, if there were, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolines beta coronavirus are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They may be a terminal host of the betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2, as are the civetas in the case of the SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities of transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First of all, worms could be the reserve host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with murciellages, through killing or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers guests in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contain the virus through the killing and the consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An anticorps study on domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both myrs and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three major viral factors also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of the species.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in the replication of the ARN.
Compared to other monocatenary ARN viruses, estimated coronavirus mutation rates could be considered “moderate” to “low”, with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the coronavirus adaptation phase to new guests.
Coronavirus has an exorribonuclease of reading check, whose elimination leads to extremely high mutability and atenation or even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotidic analogo remdesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and the ARN-dependent ARN polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronavirus are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the coronavirus is not well adapted to the guest.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 apparently is lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is expected that it has already adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic derivation will cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antiviral drugs to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long ARN genome of the coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the probability of co-evolution between species, which facilitates the appearance of new coronavirus when the appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique copying open reading frameworks and the functions of the coded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Thirdly, coronavirus changes randomly and frequently templates during the replication of the ARN using a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change occurs frequently during the coronavirus ARN transcription.
Full-length and highly homogeneous subgenomic ARNs could be recombined to generate new coronavirus.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as the SL-CoV of murciella and the CoV-HKU9 of murciella.
Interaction virus-host in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in transmitting events between species.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated SARS-CoV species of humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences rapid adaptation in different guests, with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensively selected by the guest’s antibodies response.
In the SARS-CoV, the RBD is found in the amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 and its corectors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including mouse, cybeta, mouse and mapache dog, allowing the transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acids were different from the isolated spheres of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the motif of connection to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Cybeta SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of spiga protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the S protein’s association affinity with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates the affinity of this union 10 to 20 times greater than that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine if any other corrector could be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also connects to the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans, after the transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other guest dependence and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir guests of humans coronavirus, such as worms, dromedaries, and roots, could constitute an obstacle to the transmission between species.
Human coronavirus must usurp the guest dependence factors and subvert the guest restriction factors so that the transmission between species is successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A complete genome objective research of guest dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronavirus appearance: we start from zero
The diversity of coronavirus brings numerous opportunities for the appearance of new coronavirus in humans.
Coronavirus in this sense acts as the genetic asset of coronavirus in humans.
Furthermore, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronavirus and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coders genes have the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related worms virus have been isolated, but it has been determined that they codify divergent ORF8 proteins.
A elimination of 29 characteristic nucleotides from SARS-CoV was found in isolated spheres at the beginning of the epidemic in humans.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptative mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, the SARS-CoV has possible recombination backgrounds with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the ARN-dependent polymerase ARN.
Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronavirus, in which human coronavirus is recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-structure genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genoms, which most likely results in releasing viruses from the selection pressures exercised, for example, by the guest’s immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype HCoV-229E strain, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intacta ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-related worms and camellus viruses, the alfacoronavirus of alpacas presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, causing a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also driven by the selection pressure on its reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when coronavirus was infected, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and coronavirus.
It appears that the worms are well adapted to coronavirus anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in mushrooms efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in the murciellages is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the inhibitor receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major complex of histocompatibility.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive species (ROS) generated from the elevated metabolic activity of the worms could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of the exorribonuclease, which brings the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic viral species when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus spots could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for guest adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronavirus are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reserve guests, such as mushrooms and camels.
They are replicated energetically without provoking a strong immune response from the guest.
In this are the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytocin storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lungs damage.
Instead, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of disinfection of the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in myrsels.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflamasome NLRP3 in the mushrooms is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of the inflamasome NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus is found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with the SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with the SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that cattle and other animals on the market hosts SARS-CoV identical viruses, no immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Betacoronavirus of pangolines has been found notably homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangolines betacoronavirus could bring fragments of genes to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by man, either deliberately or by accident.
The coronavirus has recovered due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronavirus in mice and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human coronavirus in transmission to humans.
Solid evidence has shown that the SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 originated in the worms and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets that had in them could have been effective in stopping the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should withdraw from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of pangolines beta-coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through the pangolines and other mammals remains for diluted in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transportation tool as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it was done in China with wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurring MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus, are circulating in wild state.
Coronavirus with zoonotic potential is very diverse.
There are great chances that these zoonotic coronavirus evolve and recombine, which would lead to the appearance of new coronavirus that are more transmissible or more mortal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although myrtles have many characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, the opportunities of contact of humans with myrtles and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to get away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and its natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
There are still several pieces missing in the puzzles of the zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the worms transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances the worms and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if mushrooms have a more direct role in transmission in humans, it should be determined how humans get in contact with mushrooms.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate guest, it must diluce how it interacts with the different species, including humans, myrtles and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it’s a worm, a pangolin or another mammal, the SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in its natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will dilute the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnosis criteria for the “ suspicious cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the results of the ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we answer a comment on our guidelines and provide the latest diagnosis criteria for “such case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it must be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and our knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the results of the ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, your work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version of the test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological backgrounds with two points of clinical manifestations to do a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological backgrounds: (1) travel or residence backgrounds in the city of Wuhan and neighboring areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases have been in the last 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (2) contact backgrounds with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) contact backgrounds with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and neighboring areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases have been in the last 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (4) contact backgrounds with confirmed groups of cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring in the period of 2 weeks in a small area, home, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in images of COVID-19 infection; (3) total count of white blood cells that show a normal, decreased or reduced count of lymphocytes in the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) real-time positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing that shows a high homogeneity to the recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or title increase ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

Moreover, there are more and more evidence that remind us that we should be cautious with the symptomatic and atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The score system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope more direct evidence will arise and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of “ suspicious case” and “confirmed case”, we recommend searching and complying with the newest guidelines of your country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines timely to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest number in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to the COVID-19 in one day.
It is the highest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been.
In an online informative session, the IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news media, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, whom they were treating at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until this next Saturday.
This public transport suspension had initially started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, it was two men who returned from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
On the 19th of March, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The hit took place the same day Malaui confirmed his first coronavirus infections and Zambia had his first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
On Thursday, the World Health Organization 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), of April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from the Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city closure until May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin said the Russians would continue to perceive their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved with 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the drop touches in the holy cities of Mekka and Medina throughout the day; previously, the drop touch only wasined between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a drop touch between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Australian supermarkets lower hygienic paper limits by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase limits of hygienic paper to two and one package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were posted as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
According to the report, consumers were suppliing COVID-19 for fear in case the people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of hygienic paper for home delivery to a package by order.
These changes were introduced after the previous four-pack restriction per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within an hour of delivery," and said the demand "there had no precedents," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unforgettable".
Sales rose with a "strong rise" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further relieve the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI put stocks available for a special Wednesday offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase the stocks, but local municipality’s restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
I predict an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and less offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the anticipated release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that supermarkets supply the stocks every night.
He highlighted that the hygienic paper is a voluminous item, which causes a low amount of existences in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of shortage.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that [that] if there was an abundant amount of the item in the shelves, if products such as hygiene paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large amounts, the panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled hygiene paper Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex hygienic paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, that some real estate sellers offered free hygiene paper to the first tenderer at the auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time the long weekend of the Workers' Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin-printed newspaper, included an eight-page entrance designed to be cut and used as hygiene paper.
The supermarkets initially showed themselves unwilling to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report, in which they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectants, dried products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres hygienic paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the ongoing outbreak of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO highlighted the need to encourage governments to take measures:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General said.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, as well as by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "have no precedent."
In a statement published by CNN in February, he said, "Addition to the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic condition arises after the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it will worsen."
Until Thursday, Associated Press that there were at least 126 000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it was declared a public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, and it was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
Around 364,000 people were recovered.
It was estimated that the case-by-case mortality rate is 4 percent in China, while, worldwide, it is between 13.04 percent in Algeria and 0.08 percent in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from other people and control and self-isolation of people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, drop touches, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic alteration, the delay or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread supply shortage aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Faulty information about the virus was spread through the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of ascendence and appearance in Eastern and Southeast Asia, and other areas with significant cases of viruses.
Due to the reduction of travel and closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of the province of Hubei) a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and at the beginning of January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
The cases, mostly, were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronavirus of the worms, the coronavirus of the pangolines and the SARS-CoV. Later, it was discovered that the first person who was known to manifest symptoms was sick on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, a non-verified South China Morning Post report suggested that, a case that dates back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from the Hubei province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO that, as the new cases, according to the reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of uninformed cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases were in young people, and those aged 19 and younger represented 2.4 percent of the cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK’s leading scientific counsel, estimated that 60 percent of the British population would have to get infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who submitted COVID-19, and who obtained a positive result confirmed according to the official protocols.
On March 23, no country had done tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies of not performing tests in people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that, in China, until January 23, an estimated amount of 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of the cases registered.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time spent from the development of the symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to the COVID-19.
In China, on February 5, around 80% of deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refer to the people who died who gave positive in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of real deaths due to COVID-19 is much greater, as it may not include the people who died without having done the test, for example, in their homes, in elderly homes, etc.
Parcial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States admitted "We know that [the number of declared deaths] is a subestimation", an affirmation corroborated by the anecdotal subcounting reports in the United States. This subestimation is frequent in pandemies, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside of continental China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had deaths, in all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to the region and time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health. The proportion of deaths per case reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to the statistics of the Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths on cases is from 6.0 % (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the region.
In China, the estimates of the percentage of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3 % (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 % (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other indicators include the percentage of deaths by cases, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died due to a disease, and the percentage of deaths by infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a fixed deadline and consider a specific population from the infection to the case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the total pandemic infection mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the mortality rate by case.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the end duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of the Pennsylvania State University said, “Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without guests available.
But at this time, it is almost impossible to make some reasonable forecast of when that will happen.”
China’s chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it could “end in June” if it could mobilize all countries to follow WHO’s recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that the SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulating, possibly for one or two years.”
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt expressed, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, since it's transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "it could become a seasonal disease, which reappears every year."
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the respiratory tract (flame), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cianosis. The WHO says that approximately one in six people are seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pressure or pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty awakening and blue color on the face or lips; before the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, so the researchers advised to carefully monitor and examine those who have a close contact with confirmed infected people in order to discard the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people oscillate from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the infection and the appearance of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details are still being determined about how the disease is spread.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during the narrow contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, snoring or speaking; narrow contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth the drops can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking.
The drops can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or, possibly, inhale to the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RCP), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, therefore, aerial spread.
It can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then you touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the appearance of the symptoms, although spread may be possible before the symptoms are manifested and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms were developed.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but, some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that, although it is not completely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, usually one person infects another two or three.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel 304, a day in carton and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, vary depending on moisture and temperature. positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronavirus related in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective embrace. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically aggregated with the gender betacoronavirus, its subgender sarbecovirus (linea B) along with two spheres derived from the worm.
At the level of the full genome, it is 96% identical to other coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangoline viruses and those of humans.
Until now, the full genome comparison indicated that the pangoline coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 share, as maximum, 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that the pangoline are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be diagnosed provisionally on the basis of the symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed through the chain reaction of the polymerase with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by imaging by computerized tomography.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which polymerase chain reaction was compared to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO has published several ARN test protocols for the SARS-CoV-2, the first of them published on January 17.
The test uses the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hypop, although a hypop for the throat can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of these showed to be accurate enough to approve their widespread use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in computerized radiography and tomography (TC) images of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral dislustrated glass opacities and absent pleural spills.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to superposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis by unconfirmed images by chain reaction of polymeras has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study conducted in China compared the results of computerized thorax tomographies with those of polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that although image diagnosis is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect viral characteristics in images, both with radiographs and with computerized tomographs.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease includeining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and snoring or coughing on a dischargeable towel and throwing the towel directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Many governments have restricted or disadvantaged all non-essential travel from and to the countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the Community phase of spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community don’t know where or how they’ve been infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who might be infected take the standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent greater transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement to demand limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on privacy-respective solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19.They are circulating erroneous ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and gargares with mouth swallow are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDCs recommend that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have their hands visibly dirty; before eating and after sounding their nose, coughing or snoring.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDCs also recommended to use a hand-based alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60% alcohol in volume when no water and soap are available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions ( within a minute after exposure to the desinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropanol at 50–100%, sodium hypochloride at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and povidone iodate at 0.2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or gardener, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touchscreen, keyboards, remote controls and automatic casinos that have been used by the sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed neck or with a dischargeable tooth for coughing or scratching, and that they discharge the tooth immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the respiratory drops that are dispersed when speaking, stunning and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without adequate hand hygiene."
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made with fabric. China specifically recommended the use of removable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transportation or be in competitive places.
Thai health officials recommend people to make fabric masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbidden to go out to public spaces without using a mask or without covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask while in public spaces to be able to protect themselves and protect others.
The government of Austria demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel has urged all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded the use of masks by passengers in interurban trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go out, while it also recommends the manufacturing of home-made masks to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to stop the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and school closure, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping centers.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding disputed areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact and physically distant from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and, subsequently, to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommend that they stay in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact whileining social connections, whether virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had a impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation, instead of encouraging them to stay in contact with other people through alternative means.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation was recommended at home for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on adequate self-isolation.Many governments have required or recommended the self-quarentine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The most strict instructions on self-quarent was issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to do self-quarentine for 14 days from the moment of the last possible exposure.
The strategies to control an outbreak are the contention or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the first stages of the outbreak and has the purpose of identifying and isolating the infected people, in addition to introducing other measures of infection control and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are transferred to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to stop the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of retention and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through the reduction of the basic number of reproduction to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarentene; Community measures oriented to physical distancing, such as school closure and annulment of mass competition events; Community commitment to foster acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection assessments and localized quarentines, and issued warnings about the movements of the infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected people who decided to make quarantine and imposed large fines to those who did not.
The simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Removal may be preferred, but it should beined for all the time the virus circulates in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if that happens first), since otherwise the transmission reacts quickly when measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eradicate the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, which includes testing of existing drugs.
Taking free-sale medications for the cold, drinking liquids and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Using steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds are being investigated that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also indicated that some “home and traditional remedies” can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines aimed at hospitals and primary medical services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures when possible, separating and isolating positive patients on COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may date on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were primarily linked to the Huanan seafarer market, which also sold living animals, and a theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed from which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who to the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police demonstrated eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for disseminating false rumors, and another physician, Ai Fen, was arrested by their superiors for giving the alarm.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed the WHO.
In early January, enough cases of unknown cause pneumonia had been to the health authorities in Wuhan as to begin an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport center and an important rail cruise.
On January 20, China about 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Following official data show that, on 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. on 26 March, the United States has overcome China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. on 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen space have restricted free movement and established border controls.
On April 2, around 300 million people, or approximately 90% of the population, meet some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, around 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 1300 million people are confined in India.
On March 26, 1,700 million people around the world suffered some kind of confinement, which increased to 2,600 million people two days later, around a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and her hospital to the Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
It was to the WHO on the same day.
As these notifications were made, the police warned the doctors in Wuhan for "disclosing rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission among humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a "People's War", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", on January 23 a health cord was announced that banned travel within and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the Government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included the issuance of health statements for travelers and the extension of the Spring Party holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transportation was changed and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor outlets. After the beginning of the world phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities adopted strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, in continental China only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveller who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang that the spread of cases transmitted nationally was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On March 26, 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa carriers or residence permits would be suspended from March 28, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassy or consulates.
The State Council declared a sad day that will start with a three-minute national silence moment on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked the families to present their respect online to comply with physical distancing in order to avoid the COVID-19 breakdown.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that the COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health agency a significant increase in confirmed cases, primarily attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devots who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% symptoms. on February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases remained in quarentine after tests confirmed that three soldiers gave positive to the virus.
South Korea presented what was considered the wider and best organized program in the world to test the virus in the population and isolate the infected people, in addition to identifying and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
Detection methods included compulsory self- reporting of symptoms by newly arrived people from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with results available the next day and increased diagnosis capacity to be able to do tests on up to 20,000 people every day.
The South Korean program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting the quarantine in whole cities. South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon's withdrawal so they considered a bad handling of the outbreak by the government, or, to praise his response.

The Shiite sanctuaries in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.
In the midst of the claims of a coverage of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran for February 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases by the Iranian government for that date.
The Iranian parliament closed, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members that they obtained positive results in the virus test.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the spread of the outbreak was confirmed to Italy, when two Chinese tourists gave positive in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The cases began to rise rapidly, leading the Italian government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Later, a group of unrelated cases of COVID-19 were detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new law decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantineing more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy of a large aged population and the incapacity to do tests to all people who have the virus so far could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first arose as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any kind of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of rapidity and intensity in its response to the concerns faced by the public.

The WHO praised the efforts of Chinese authorities to control and prevent the epidemic.
The WHO pointed out the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when the Chinese authorities were accused of secretism that prevented the prevention and contention efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government “has provided periodic updates to avoid panic before the Lunar New Year holidays.”
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to implement a transport prohibition in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea pointed out that, although "definitively it was not a recommendation that the WHO has made", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "there was no precedent in the history of public health."On 30 January, after the confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since the measure was initiated for the first time during the 2009 influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the ESPII was due “to the risk of worldwide spread, especially to the low and medium-income countries without solid health systems.”
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel” and that “the WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the world community for a $675 million contribution to fund a strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries "who don't have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if there are."
Tedros also made statements in which he said that "only we are as strong as our weak slope" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future."On February 11, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros said that the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to bring “the power of the entire UN system in the response.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to the WHO, will allow them “to focus on the health response while other bodies can provide their specialized knowledge to address the wider social, economic and developmental consequences of the outbreak.”
On February 14, a joint mission team led by the WHO with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to help in national management and evaluate "the severity and transmission of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at national level and to make visits to the site in order to evaluate the "impact of response activities at provincial and county level, including urban and rural environments."On February 25, the WHO declared that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," and pointed out that, although it was still very early to call it a pandemic, the countries should not yet be "a preparation phase".
On February 28, WHO officials said the worldwide coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, WHO’s health emergency program executive director, warned in a statement that “This is a reality verification for all governments on the planet: they wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared,” insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world to avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also said that the current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and said that such declaration would mean that "basically we are accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus pandemic.
He said the WHO was "very worried, both for the alarming levels of spread and severity, as well as for the alarming levels of inaction."The WHO has received significant criticism so it is considered an inadequate pandemic management, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom's resignation request, signed by 733 000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized that the rights of all people are respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts indicated that everyone has the right to the interventions that save lives and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group highlighted that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification of discrimination against a specific group.
Experts highlighted that all people have the right to health, including people with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older people, internally displaced people, homeless people, those living in extreme poverty conditions, people detained, as well as refugees and other non-specified groups that need government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide complete and timely information on political answers in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for their handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were dismissed due to their handling of the quarentine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from the public anger for the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed a previous recognition of the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favour of conspirative theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "China virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and said that "China censorship overheated a virus that has now become a world pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distracts [the] failure of its administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. Government that described an apparent-origin communication scheme in the National Security Council, and the strategy was quoted as "Everything About China".
We have been told that we are trying to transmit this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. ”Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China’s efforts to send help to the countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The EU’s foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also asked the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to reports, sent aid to these last two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
They also accused the U.S. authorities of shifting aid to other countries to their own country.
And disputes related to the masks have been between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of respirators destined to Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that “only China responded bilateral.
This is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided that the Russian army would send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” that claimed that 80% of Russia’s aid was “inutile or useless for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of undertaking an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “With offering assistance to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and equipment charge, they will also be able to respond if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic Countries, NATO’s largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a small scale.
Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Secretary-General Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, it puts in danger the lives not only of the U.S. troops and the different European countries that participate, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate.”
On March 14, 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, and said his country is having difficulties to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to the international markets as a result of the U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the demand that the U.S. adopts common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's possibilities of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will stay in quarantine for two weeks on sites designated by the government.
South Korea’s society was initially polarized with respect to Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand Moon's withdrawal so they considered a bad handling of the outbreak by the government, or, to praise his response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree indefinitely, suspend the Parliament and elections and punish those who are considered to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
He was guilty of the coronavirus outbreak of several cases of supply shortage, as a result of the worldwide increased use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and interruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medications and medical equipment due to the increased consumer demand and the disruption of suppliers.
Several locations also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, hygienic paper and bottled water, which caused the lack of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in the shipping of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated a rise in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused four to six months delays in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and the WHO warned that this would put health workers in danger.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy’s measures against the accumulation and illegal trade of essential products have been successful, and prevented an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not had a considerable decrease, but prices could rise, according to sector representatives.
Food stores were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to keep reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 journalistic report, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been considered a considerable threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences arises.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
According to the report, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was “revolved” after a strong fall in oil prices due to China’s lowest demand.
On February 24, the world securities markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside of continental China.
On February 27, due to the growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock exchanges, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, published their most prominent falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the highest fall in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with decreases of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, butined a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears for the coronavirus, the greatest fall occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a economic recession.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the state and central banks’ timely emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel prohibitions, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have canceled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the sector of cruise companies reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and transborders terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events in which large crowds participated were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year's Festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including Beijing’s Forbidden City and the traditional temple fair.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, authorities extended the New Year's Holiday until February 10, and ordered most jobs not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of GDP and 90% of the country’s exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a decrease of 50 to 60%.
This also caused a decrease of 33 to 43% in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world imposed additional measures, such as greater hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than those who would have stayed in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s almost 300 million migratory rural workers were stunned in their homes in domestic provinces or trapped in the Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government aid.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. Around 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in the middle of March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers requested a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term government-subsidized work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term labor compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The scénic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which impacted the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Organizations in the culture and arts sector tried to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the security of its employees and the public, and support artists when possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and at different degrees, museums, libraries, spectacle sites and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were canceled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence and that increases at an accelerated pace of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. important sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Quarter Penitentious season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of taking part in the Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcast via the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the Plaza de San Pedro empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their services and restricted public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayer in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the sanctuaries, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mekka and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most important sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans for the 2020 Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "reprogrammed for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021".
This caused many gamblers to resort to the Internet, many online betting sites significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those of Broadway, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and share their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous memes on the Internet have spread about the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and Eastern Asian descendants, and towards people from the regions of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Fear, suspicion and hostility incidents have been observed in many countries, in Europe, Eastern Asia, North America and the Asia and Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world that expressed that Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair repression.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside of it.
After the advance of the outbreak towards new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe that experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to the prohibition of Chinese entry to their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the UK and the United States, have higher levels of racist insults, in addition to aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "China virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuated people from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and who study in the major Indian cities, suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unity of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "this is why God revenge from them."
In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign laundry" and intended for the "release".
Many newspapers with payment walls removed them for parts or the whole of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus ARN.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the ARN of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Anticorps detection (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for population surveillance.
Anticorps tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms to report them or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to the limited evidence, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are great variations in the number of tests performed in the different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting the mortality rates by cases, which are likely to be very overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopaths or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hisopaths is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people to whom the test is performed in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract by means of a suction catheter, or the material that is expelled to the cough (sput) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical-degree polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China from a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their real-time polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel with reverse transcriptase for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories by the International Resource Reagent.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unfinished results due to defective reactors, and a break in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples were satisfyingly processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests that use two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only from then it was allowed to state and local laboratories begin to perform tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use permit. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the COVID-19 tests based on the reverse transcriptase polymera chain reaction.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available tests for COVID-19 at the national level.
No quantity limits have been announced; the collection of spices and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for the COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, it was that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be done within a period of 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a period of 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the FDA emergency use authorization for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the isothermic amplification technology of nucleic acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a number of varied temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the new coronavirus nucleocapside protein (protein N), with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a quick flu test.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that “torax radiographies have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while TC results can be obtained even before the symptoms appear.”
The typical characteristics of the TC include bilateral multilobary opacities in dislustrated glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease advances, subpleural domination, pattern in empedrate and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the chain reaction of polymerase was compared with computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computerized tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
Part of the immune system's reaction to the infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately from the 7 days after the appearance of the symptoms, to determine immunity and in the surveillance of the population.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analyses in central laboratories, only one sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single blood sample is generally obtained by a skin point.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as it corresponded and, therefore, now can distribute their antibodies tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect the IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is of several hundred samples within hours and, therefore, is much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of the viral ARN polymerase.
In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibodies test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for a sample", the patient escape in the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infects others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In tests at drive-through centers for the COVID-19 of suspicious cases, a health professional takes the samples having the appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutary Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several major cities.
On March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only the positive results were.
A first laboratory survey revealed that at the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed in total, including and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) threw positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists in grouping the samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47% greater and that the corresponding cost to face the quarantine had doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, immediately Huo-Yan laboratories were built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reactors affected mass tests in the European Union and the U.S.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genoms to make more tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in their population than any other country, and was directed to increase the level of tests to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI population level (which was based on their “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas have been developed to address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that sent to low-income countries that didn’t have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, which delayed the tests available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the large availability of tests from South Korea helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean government has achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programs as the best way to reduce the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the wide spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests delayed in U.S. private laboratories, and the supplies of hisopaths and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then eliminated the bureaucratic barriers that had avoided the conduct of private tests. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to the incorrect sampling of samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the kits that threw incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results.
Atheş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and didn't "put them into use."The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, it announced that they didn't serve.
The conduct of tests, complemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of the people with whom they had been in touch who gave positive on SARS-CoV-2, caused satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Voi, the place where the first death of COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in the entire population of around 3,400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were placed in quarantine.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus 2020 pandemic in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but that did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began to recommend residents to stay in their homes, but schools opened back in time after March 23 holidays.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less strict confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates by cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who only have mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity for testing and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to make confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following tab, the column “Positive as % of tests” is influenced by the country’s policy for testing.
A country that only performs tests on people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positive as % of tests than a country that performs tests on all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands with the purpose of eliminating dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if you don’t wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing pants, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or manipulating raw meat, fish or bird.
If no water or soap is available, your hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose is sounded, coughing or shrinking.
After touching animals, food for animals or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medications or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or illness.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or who work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
Reduce the rate of child mortality in births at home.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can generate small improvements in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by approximately a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
The 48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. handwashing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under the age of five, and the lives of an estimated amount of 1.8 million children per year are charged.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bath into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce to almost half the deaths from diarrhea and to a quarter the deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Generally, handwashing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against impety, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of handwashing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin resecurity.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive handwashing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and causes the skin to become scamosa known as hands eczema or hands dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (oring, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing pants), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or manipulating raw meat, fish or bird.
Other occasions in which a right handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cutting or a wound; after snoring, coughing or sounding the nose; after touching animal waste or manipulating animals; and after touching waste.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, in average, 38.7 percent of families practiced handwashing with soap. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with a 97 percent; the United States was close to half with a 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate with a 23 percent. Currently, there are several methodologies for behavior change, to increase the adoption of the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a custom action to promote the health and education of children.
Disparasizing twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin improves by adding to the water soap or detergents.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because the fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are swallowed with the foam.
However, the CDCs say that “the liquid soap with dispensation controls that do not involve the use of the hands is preferable.”
Antibacterial soap has been promoted intensely for a conscious public of health.
Currently, there is no evidence to prove that the use of recommended desinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfacing agent and that protects the skin, the sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, dairy acid) as well as pH regulator, antimicrobial activity benzoic acid and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extract).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the hands.
A pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at a body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water to eliminate natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a water-free agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, hand hygiene agents without water and with alcohol to fry (also known as alcohol-based hand solution to fry, antiseptic hand solution to fry or hand desinfectants) began to gain popularity.
The majority is based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thick agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the reset effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity even more. Hand-to-hand desinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 percent of alcohol effectively eliminate the germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to scratch remove bacteria, bacteria resistant to various drugs (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Drink-based alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70% of alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hands desinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to frog, such as to moisturize or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and ends of all fingers, are frotted for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dry.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend handwashing before hand desinfectants for handwashing, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid activity of microorganism removal; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper handwashing unless water or soap is available.
Frequent use of hands-based alcohol-based disinfectants can resecate the skin, unless emoliants or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emolients to the formula.
In clinical trials, the alcohol-based hand-based disinfectants containing emolients caused a considerably smaller skin irritation and drought than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in hand-based alcohol-based spray solutions are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to handwashing with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand desinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens continue to remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of hands-free alcohol-free disinfectants depends greatly on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much lower than the alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to frotat.
More recently, it has been proven that the formulas that use benzalconium chloride have a persistent and accumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to the progressive adverse reactions of the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil in return.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if the soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when no soap is available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold current water.
Current water is recommended because stagnated water containers may be contaminated, while the water temperature seems to make no difference.
Frot the hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the dorses of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and restricting for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Wash well with current water.
Washing in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
The moist and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The parts that are most often forgotten are the wrist, the wrist, the areas between the fingers and below the nails
Artificial nails and scratched nail smalt can accommodate microorganisms.
Often, moisturizing lotion is recommended to prevent hands from scratching; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate handwashing when no current water or soap is available, for example, throwing water from a hanged pot or a calabaza with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home grids" and other economic options.
A home graffiti is a simple technology that consists in using a suspended jar of a soga and a foot-actioned palanca to wipe a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towels industry association, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and modern air-run hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 percent in the fingers and by 254 percent in the palms.
Drying with the air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria by 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was the possibility of cross-contamination from other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air dryer, which sweeps air from the unit at speeds, according to it, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to sweep the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count were observed after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared with drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand desinfecting towels is an alternative during travel, when you don’t have water or soap.
The hand-based alcohol-based desinfectant should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The doctors' handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind staff members of the hospital that they wash their hands when they forget.
A study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
The doctor's handwashing is done for at least 15 seconds, with abundant amount of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrain all parts of the hands.
The hands should be stretched together by connecting the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a pig brush to remove them.
Since the germs can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After the drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any output door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the medical care environment is to eliminate the pathogenic microorganisms ("gymns") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching the patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a sheet in which handwashing and standard handwashing are demonstrated in the medical sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website so that the public can make comments.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the hygiene of the hands, if proof of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Moments” for Handwashing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
After an asphabetic work and
The add-on of antiseptic chemicals in the soap (medical or antibacterial soap) confers the possibility of removal to the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are very frequent. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, you need to have a grip that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to freeze and another sterilized instrument to clean under your nails.
All the jewellery must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and bracelets up to the neck, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, it should be avoided that the water from the bracelets returns to your hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical bat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after healing sick people.
To control staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it has been proven that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that it gets very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand hygiene increases more than 35%.
By comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that drinking with alcohol reduced bacterial pollution by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing the H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium difficile hand spores than the alcohol-based hand desinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand desinfectants and written and oral reminders to staff.
It is necessary to investigate more about which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to universal handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few grifes to wash hands near public or private retreats, although there are economic options to build handwashing stations.
However, low hands wash rates can also be the result of rooted habits and not the lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and cause a long-term behavior change in the population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF’s “Three Stars” approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can switch from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing campaigns that are brought forward to decreasing diseases and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that tries to a change in behavior. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of handwashing in developing countries in relation to AVADs avoided.
However, one analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, in particular for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newborn mothers or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the “founder of modern nursing.”
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-transmitted diseases and health care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters with "correct techniques to wash hands" were hanged alongside the washrooms of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "wash your hands" is a statement of not wanting to take care of something or sharing the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much broader phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean an imaginary spot, which represents her guilt awareness about the crimes she had committed and that had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been verified that after remembering or reflecting on nonethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value more the elements for handwashing.
In addition, those people who have permitted to wash their hands after such reflection, are less likely to engage in other compensatory “cleaning” actions, such as a volunteer.
Religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Bahá’u’lláh, Hinduism, Tevila and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing in Christianity and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend handwashing hygienic, after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam are forced to wash hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force to wash hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19
The workplace risk controls before the COVID-19 refers to the application of methodologies of occupational hygiene and safety in the risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Suitable risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the job task and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers that may be prone to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimum work contact with the public and their colleagues, for which basic infections prevention measures are advised, including handwashing, recommending workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who could be infected by current Community transmission or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and individual protection equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high exposure risk, which increases very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Suitable risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and suitable individual protection equipment for work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences on the workplace.
Workers may lack work because of getting sick, having to take care of others or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both with regard to what goods are requested and the means of acquisition of those goods (such as buying in non-pick hours, by means of home shipping services or by window from the car).
Finally, submissions of items from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. a preparation and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, the risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and the risk factors for individual workers, such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address those risks and the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreaks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of an outbreak response include reducing the transmission between staff members, protecting people with the highest risk of suffering from adverse health complications,ining commercial operations and minimizing the adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures that are taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a broadly used framework in the field of occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are the engineering controls, followed by the administrative and, finally, the individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related dangers without resorting to workers’ behavior and can be the most profitable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labor policies or procedures that require action from the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protection equipment must be selected according to the danger for the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g., respirators), used properly and systematically, frequently reviewed, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or removed correctly in order not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Health and Occupational Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with low exposure risk have a minimum labor contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic infection prevention measures that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, the respiratory hygiene standards that include covering when coughing and snoring, the provision of paper pants and containers for waste, the preparation for teletwork or scaled turns if necessary, the dissuading workers from using foreign tools and equipment and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at work.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medications to alleviate symptoms or decrease fever; that the disease license policies are flexible and allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work with average exposure risk includes those that require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1,8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the Community moment transmission around the company’s location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, as well as in schools, the work environments with a high concentration of people protection and some large-scale retail sales environments. Engineering controls for this group and the high-risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the rise of a ventilation rate, the installation of physical barriers on the work or the other work barriers on the most transparent plastic coverage and the placement of a work window for the care service so that the customer can request from the car. The administrative controls for this group and the high-risk groups include recommending the sick workers to stay at home, replacing the presencial meetings by virtual communications, establishing an escalation rate, the installation of the physical barriers on the work or the other work barriers on the most transparent plastic coverage and the use of the work facilities with a minimum risk of the work and the use of the work facilities on the workplace,
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect the workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper pants when it bite or stroke.
The cabin crew should wear removable surgical gloves to attend a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, possibly, individual protection equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other dischargeable items must be thrown in a bag for dangerous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other ships carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by disease, self-isolation and immediately informing the medical center on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other massive meetings, such as physical or coro education classes or dining in the dining room, increasing the space between pupiters, scaling entrance and exit times, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, can be considered to extend the cancellation of the classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDCs consider that the immediate health risk is low.
Police officers are advised to get in touch with people who have a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and their equipment with a aerosol or household cleaning towels before re-use them and follow the standard operational procedure for the containment and waste of personal protection equipment and the containment and washing of clothes.
The OSHA considers that certain health workers are within categories of high or very high exposure risk.
Among the high-risk exposure jobs are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicion of COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnoses or suspicion of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some procedures and dental examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; these pass to have a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering checks for those risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when aerosol generation procedures are carried out.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure can be suitable in some medical care environments.
The samples should be manipulated by taking Biosecurity Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter separate themselves in different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they may have COVID-19.In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, the OSHA recommends the use of masks for those people working at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with filtering mask approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker.The WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, pay attention to them or transport them without carrying out aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, glasses or facial protector, bat and gloves.
If a aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask should be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends to minimize the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of entrance permission to a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those people involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while the attention is provided to several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and slowing the use of mask by asymptomatic people.

This year, we are in a special situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our human interconnection globally and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges you present have no precedents, but we know that our best response lies in empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible are the people with whom we are lucky to work.
I could not feel greater gratitude and pride that you are all my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
I was remembered how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether by keeping the sites in operation, helping our colleagues receive their payment or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjust to our work and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C team met yesterday night to talk about our approach and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we thought would be an adequate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the organization’s sustainability at this time.
In greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it’s okay.
For all employees, contractors and contractual workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great utility for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, make shopping or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We are not taking the account of your hours.
If you are sick, don’t work.
Although it should not be necessary to say it, we say it.
You don’t need to apply for a disease license or paid free time; just report to your manager and help your team review the schedules and schedules to make sure the key areas of work are covered.
(If you get a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, tell Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with support and make sure the management is aware of your situation).
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff colleagues who work per hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked in normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it’s about your personal care.
What we ask you is to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are a few things we must continue to do.
Site reliability engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery teams, among others, perform a critical job that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate current goals and modify our approach in order to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing the speed today will not hurt us tomorrow.
We don’t plan to “duplicate the hours to get up to date” when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to set new goals and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens with the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adapt to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our Annual Planning for 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care of loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced time during the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning loads and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will communicate the next steps to the delegates and teams we will hardly have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our San Francisco office colleagues might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautions measure, we hire an antiviral cleaning equipment to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all the surfaces, in addition to the reception and the elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own protocol of duty of care, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our office in DC is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we’ve also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who already worked in remote form from before know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of the meetings to intervals of one or two hours as maximum.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to separate them within several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the video use by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who control questions in the chat and speakers list, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare refund for refrigerators.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The Operations team of RR.HH. is analyzing the guidelines on web-based ergonomics to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week, we ask all Community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editing sites, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We inform you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to comply with your part of the activities agreed for the subsidy and that there would be no sanction for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This next week we will follow with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general sense of the community globally seems to be, in part, sadness for the interruption and in part, relief for clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both the Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will work to set up a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space to the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendar for the next Thursday, 14:00 h, coordinated universal time/07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take advantage of this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information in this email and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are being widely affected today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage problem or anything you may need help, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and work as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or delicate affairs, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations at RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are a recognition that, at this time, our work and our obligations probably should be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other in order to be able to continue working, to give our movement the necessary support and to provide the world the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make place for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and, possibly, in the coming months.
We need all of you so that this is possible and, therefore, we need that you take care and care for your families so that they can find themselves in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheses to the external surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 contrasts the activity of the associated angiotensin converter enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic diana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called HECA2.
Angiotensin Converter Enzyme 2 is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endotelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal renal amino acids carrier domain.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the lungs and other tissues cells.
The extra-cellular domain of the ECA2 is separated from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released in the bloodstream and, in the end, is excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is adhered, primarily, to the cell membrane of the alveolar cells type II of the lungs, to the thin intestine enterocytes, to the venous blood and endotelial cells and to the blood cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The MARN expression of ECA2 is also found in the cortex of the brain, the striated body, the hypothalamus and the encephalic trunk.
The main function of the ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The ECA scinds the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, the ECA2 scinds the carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it to form vasodilatatory angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also scind several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
The ECA2 also regulates membrane traffic of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes the SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes the COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spiga protein S1 with the enzymatic domination of ECA2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes that are inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host's serin protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypotheses that the reduction of the levels of ECA2 in the cells could help fight the infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory entities have recommended continuing standard ECA and BRA inhibitor therapy.
A review with systematic metaanalysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases.”
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ECA inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of the ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the general pneumonia risk.”
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute lungs injury and seems to improve lungs hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in milk with acute respiratory difficulty syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharides.
The average life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the beginning of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those people with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is high. RhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help with the tracking of contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who could have been in contact with a contagious person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy-related concerns have been raised, in particular, in relation to the systems that are based on the tracking of the geographical location of the application users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to admit such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by a local IT community, it was launched as an open-source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application was launched to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for its implementation in the coming weeks. a similar application is planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and Singapore’s BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetration application for patients living in Moscow and having received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they don’t leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positive and the possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceitful or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have submitted a statement to demand limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations set eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extension of monitoring and surveillance should have extinction clauses;
the use of the data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in the law;
protection against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be established;
The significant participation of all “relevant stakeholders” will be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to bruto location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary that all systems with central servers have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to carry out contact tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate notifications through text messages for potentially contagious people.
In addition to using this information to alert about possible contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, something that is permitted due to the extensive changes to the information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered to use centralized and privacy protection systems.
By April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Tracking contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a lot of published research that dates back, at least, to 2013. By April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts groups were working on privacy-respective solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, the personal identification data never comes out of the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Outside Control Applications: How to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma's SafeTrace platform MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share delicate location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of those data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the World TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing the global interoperability of tracking and alerts applications, a key aspect for achieving a broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that, according to them, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of the tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the problems of adoption and persistent surveillance by distributing, first, the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
Reperfilation (also known as reposition or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. The SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple sites of bonding with the bonding.
The analysis of these linking sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important diane proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papaya-like protease, ARN-directed polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chlorokin is an anti-paludic drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin related would be among the four drugs that would be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests with chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychlorokin sulfate and chlorokin phosphate through an Urgent Use Authorization (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trials process and is authorized according to a US only as a experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that “the use, dose or duration of hydroxychlorokin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” are not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul carries out a small study on the use of chlorokin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are ongoing.
The NYU Langone Medical Faculty is conducting a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorokin.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to prove that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen gave negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence that supports the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would resort to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antiviral drugs, concluded that “no benefits were observed.”
The drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that connects to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.In the scientific community, criticism has arisen about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Essay.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections.Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two directed by University of Cleveland hospitals; one for people with a moderate disease and another for those with a more severe disease.
There are three intravenous clinical trials of vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began tests with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclessonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of enzyme converting angiotensin 2, a Phase II trial is ongoing and 200 serious patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be registered to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in decreasing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is registering 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who breastfeed or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicenter study with 300 patients was announced in Italy to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparine in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying a lot of attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (block the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed the clinical trials, there are many attempts ongoing to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in safety studies in phase I.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, which triggered considerable investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the published genoms to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists that 10 different technological platforms were researching and developing in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the dianas of the main platforms that passed to safety studies in phase I, are the following:
Nucleic acid (DNA and ARN) (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, vector of adenovirus type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, in total, 115 possible vaccines are in the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (this is presumed to be planned or developing).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary tests of safety and immunogenicity, usually random, is placebo-controlled and is performed on several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in evaluation on humans (followed in the "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular subject vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to start in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28, 2020.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology associate, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology that is used in the treatment with neoantigenic vaccines against cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a Generex subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested on humans "in the 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at the Fuerte Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in the west of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Nearly March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
The development and manufacturing of a vaccine.
The associates also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolated and that, although it advances quickly, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, Quebec, the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human tests are expected to start in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "big amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", before which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an ARNm-based vaccine.
The possible ARNm BNT162 vaccine is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it will have the results of pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and that testing on humans of the possible final vaccine could begin in autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the CEPI’s total investment for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
The other CEPI associates for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing on animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an ARN vaccine with self-replying against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the initiatives of Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a “national vaccine bank” with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus spread occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Faculty of Medicine announced the tests of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, on mice and said that “SARS-CoV-2 subunity vaccines administered by MNA obtained powerful answers from the specific antibodies of the antigen (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce innocuous particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4170 health workers.
The vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of the COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by the ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, show the need to have level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the manipulation of living viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested on non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing SRAG research could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, a SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed Phase I clinical trials on humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviric vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media promoted a conspirative theory that the COVID-19 causing virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
Patents quoted by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus species, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, smell loss and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the beginning of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorganic insufficiency.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered.The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through drops that occur when coughing, snoring or speaking.
While these drops occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or over the surfaces, instead of being contagious at long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, although spread is also possible before the symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopath.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that you do not use them, others recommend that you use them, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical care.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as stroke, nasal gout and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed breast oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorganic insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do this within 11.5 days of infection. according to reports, not all infected people present symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was carried out.
Both the sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking loud releases more drops than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth when coughing can make the drops travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually of air transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside the people's bedrooms gave positive in viral ARN.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RCP) can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility that it spreads through the feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before the symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not completely clear the facility with which it spreads, a person generally infects two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected for a day on the carton, up to three days on plastic (polipropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on products with 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on moisture and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if they are used properly. soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on an average of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the test.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronavirus of related nature.
Outside of the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it revives its protective bubble. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells through the type 2 angiotensin converter enzyme (ECA2), which is more abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect with the ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in serious illness.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to the ECA2 receptors in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in their functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombembolia (25%) was detected in UCI patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a bad forecast. In the autopsy of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrations with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by the epithelial cells that express the ECA2 of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that the pathogenic GM-CSF secretor T lymphocytes were correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretor monocytes and a severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsy, lymphocytic infiltrates were also.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on samples of the respiratory tract obtained by a nasopharyngeal hypopathy; however, samples of nasal hypopathy or sputum can also be used.
The results are usually available between a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that world laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCRs) to detect the virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developing, but they were not widely used.
China’s experience with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 to use it at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular smelled glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and subsequent distribution are common in the initial stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, they may appear subpleural domination, pattern in disordered empedrate (septal lobulillar engrossing with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic injuries and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological outcomes of autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of gravity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: lung edema, pneumocytes hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytes infiltration and the formation of giant cells with multiple nucleus
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
ADHD is the cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leucoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handheld when coughing or snoring and, if you don’t have handhelds, use the inner part of the neck.
A proper hygiene of the hands is recommended after coughing or snoring.
CDCs have recommended the use of tissue taps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distancing strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling crowd public meetings.
Distance guidelines also indicate that people should keep a distance of 6 feet (1,8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19.As it is not expected to have a vaccine until 2021, as very soon, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing your hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visiblely dirty, before eating and after sounding your nose, coughing or snoring.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand desinfectant that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available timely. For areas where hand desinfectants are not easy to get, the WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; “it is not an active substance for hands antisepsia.”
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are provided with support care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus use a simple mask.
Oxygenation by extracorporal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms in the initial stage of the infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of the symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parecetamol (acetaminofen), instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of the transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare environments when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation are carried out.
The CDC recommends health care professionals to take care of people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to prevent air transmission.
The recommended equipment is EPP bat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, breathers are preferred (instead of masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an Urgent Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against the particles that are in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness is not guaranteed against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications.
When there are no available masks, the CDC recommend the use of protective carets or, as the last resource, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are so.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for hospitalized people with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal canal or positive bippression in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known if any of these two brings the same benefit to people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canal. Serious cases occur mainly in older adults (over 60 years old and, in particular, over 80 years old).
Many developed countries don’t have enough head beds in hospitals, limiting the health system’s ability to handle the sudden increase of severe cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 percent were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 percent needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4 percent died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the UCI.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumotorax.
The older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedies seem to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may be delayed until 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests of the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted a temporary permission to the convaleent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical trials to prove whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "strict contact" and, therefore, a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of the other three users.
If a possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-confining, but also warns local health officials. Analysis of cellular information macrodates, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the data from the mobile phones of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and to protect those who can get in touch with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data of the location of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed him that “in any way, 40% of people continue to move.”
The German government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for mental health and people's well-being."
The disease can follow a mild evolution with few or without symptoms, so it will look like other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as common colds.
Light cases usually recover within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of getting a serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SRAG and SROM, but COVID-19 data are insufficient.
In the most severe cases, COVID-19 can progress quickly to water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA), which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic shock and multiorganic insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, alteration of coagulation and heart, kidney and liver damage.
The alteration of coagulation, specifically the increase in the time of protombin, has been in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the alteration of renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately between 20 and 30 percent of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of the symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the UCI, an average seven-day time between hospitalization and death passed.
In an early case study, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological tests of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cellular fibromychoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or heart failure.
According to March U.S. data, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition.The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by the condition vary due to those regional differences, but also by methodological difficulties.
The insufficient counting of mild cases may make the mortality rate overestimate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lungs images suggest organs affected.
This can also cause the post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
By March 2020, it was unknown if previous infections generated a long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been that later gave positive on coronavirus.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered natural and animal by means of an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but, by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to the transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed out as the first date of the start of the symptoms on 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications that the first manifestation of the symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmation and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmation.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people dying from a disease, and the mortality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) dying from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from the infection to the case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was a relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overlooked.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0,004 % of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is for those who are in their 50, and the gap between men and women is only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immune differences, the lowest number of women smoking and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a earlier age could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of the people infected were male and 72% of the deaths from COVID-19 were male.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A greater percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more chances of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date on which the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations raise denomination to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 responsible virus” in public communications.
Coronavirus is commonly used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease water for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the capacity limits in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hisopes and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a respirator and the supplier couldn’t deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, theories of conspiracy, false information and disinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease arose that rapidly spread through the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, pots or chickens.
There are no medications or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Essay” to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccine strategies are being investigated.
First, the researchers are looking to develop a complete viral vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitivizes the immune system to certain subunities of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the protein S that helps the virus to get into the ECA2 receiver.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or ARN, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. Anticorps-based improvement has been suggested to be a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
By April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychlorokin or chlorokin.
The readapted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and which should be by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was underway.A number of antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
By March 2020, there is attempted evidence about the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being carried out in the U.S., China and Italy. Chlorokin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020.
However, there are requests for pairs reviews for the research.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that the double of that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use permit for hydroxychlorokin and chlorokin at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial S-protein chewing by type 2 transmembranary serin-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Chlorokin and hydroxychlorokin studies with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytocins can be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychlorokin may have properties that prevent the release of citocins. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-releated national phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify citocin releases, you counter such effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleucine-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant citocine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
Until now, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
It is investigating the transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with unsuccessful results.
Viral neutralization is the expected action mechanism through which a passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell-dependent antibodies cytotoxicity or fagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, who later died from COVID-19 after generating awareness about the spread of the virus.
