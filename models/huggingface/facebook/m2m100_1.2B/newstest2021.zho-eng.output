Xinhua Times Review: Bringing Excellent Farmers' Workers Back to Home to Make Rural Revitalization Force - Xinhua Network
Rural revitalization, people are key.
Where do people look for?
Excellent return farmers and workers are an indispensable force.
New shops are shopped.
Xinhua news agency Chengdu July 26th: The return of excellent peasant workers to the countryside as a revitalization force
This year's 34-year-old Zhang Yoshima in Sichuan Eun-san City Fruit Village, in 2010, he resigned from the Beijing monthly salary of tens of thousands of jobs to return home and start a business.
After years of hard work, he now operates a family farm with annual income of more than 1 million yuan, becomes a leading riches of small fame, and is also selected to enter the village "two committees" group.
In recent years, inspired by a series of agricultural and agricultural policies such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more excellent peasant workers like Zhang Yoon have chosen to return home and start, activating the rural springwater.
China's western population province, labor export province of Sichuan, due to the advantage of the implementation of the "excellent peasant labour recruitment training project", only in 2019, from the recruitment of excellent peasant labour produced more than 8,000 secretaries of the village party branch, cultivated the village reserve force of 6.1 thousand people, and developed more than 20 thousand party members, to win the fight against poverty and implement the rural revitalization strategy provides a strong guarantee.
Small is not well, it is important to look at the country.
Since the reform and opening up, China's rural youth and youth labor force has increased, and some have founded their own enterprises.
But objectively also led to the rural "empty" to different degrees of appearance, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, the secretary of the village party branch and the party member team showed the characteristics of "old and low", that is, age aging, low academic qualifications, the village party organization led the leader's team is not strong, and the problem is not highlighted.
If rural talents and other elements have been flowing to the city in a single direction, rural areas have long been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia", revitalization is a blank word.
Attracting those who are capable, conscious, and willing to serve their homelands, guiding them to return to their homeland and start-up to become the leaders of wealth, from which to cultivate the best in party members, rural cadres, and strengthen the grassroots cadres, is a solution to the grassroots party members and grassroots party organizations.
Excellent peasant workers are brought back, but also let them stay and work well.
In recent years, Sichuan has taken care of the construction of the peasant labor party, on the basis of strict candidate standards, established institutional mechanisms such as excellent peasant workers' orientation, service guarantee, training capacity raising, selection and use, so that they have an improvement in capacity, security at work, hope in life, are really rooted in the countryside, and directors have a sense of entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of decision-making to fight poverty alleviation, and the link between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization is the key factor.
The government of the Party committees at all levels should attach great importance to the group of excellent returning and returning peasants and workers, and through comprehensive measures, make them a workforce that can withstand, fight and not take away, and provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's university graduates are very special, on the evening of July 11, the Bilibili Summer Graduate Song Festival brought a special online live show for graduates, the old wolf, Park Tree, Li宇春, Mao Unleashed and other musicians to sing and congratulate the graduates.
The well-known up owner Seal Wu Wu Iwan also brought a "Wild Grass", which is a singing song adapted by him based on the prose collection of prose of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the relationship of the epidemic, many graduates were unable to experience the ceremonial sense of on-site grading and awarding degrees, they transferred the ceremonial sense to the online.
The data showed that the two-and-a-half-hour concert reached a peak of more than 35 million live broadcasts.
“Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, and sometimes there will be unexpected harvests.”
Despite being a graduation festival, many songs also touch non-graduate graduates.
"The whole look really want to cry, whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth missing, must be courageous to go on."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve attracting more than 500 species of wildlife to "settle" cities

The capital's natural ecology continues to be good Attracting wildlife to "settle" cities
More than 500 species of wildlife in Beijing
The Beijing Youth Journal reporter learned from the City Gardens Green Administration that in recent years with the continued improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment, the species and number of wildlife has also continued to increase.
At present, the number of land-based vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown horse chickens, black cockroaches and other national protective animals, as well as national secondary protective animals such as squirrels, big swans, greyhounds and squirrels.
Whether it is planted somewhere in the urban forest, or embedded between buildings, small wetlands not only bring wildlife to the capital citizens, but also attract wildlife to the city.
During the summer season, there is a vibrant phase of life in the Matsun National Nature Reserve located in the Yunnan Mountains in the northwestern part of the Yunnan Region.
A cockroach was playing in the mountains, and two dogs were fighting with each other.
At the end of 2019, in this total area of more than 6,200 hectares of green sea, there are 178 species of wildlife, including the national level of animal protection gold sculptures and the national secondary level of animal protection chickens, plaques, and one-third of the wildlife species in the city can be seen here.
“In Matsumoto, wild animals are the real ‘masters’, and our staff can only count as the ‘guards’ of people.”
Hu said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife and flora in the protection area in the field, there are more than 30 professional patrols every day, along 16 carefully formulated protection routes inspections, there will be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day to walk around almost the entire protection area.
“At the time of the inspection, not only were the records of biodiversity recorded, but also the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of wounded wildlife, the installation of wild infrared cameras, and so on.”
More than 200 infrared cameras have now been installed in the national nature reserve of Matsushima to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
As the biodiversity of the protected areas continues to be enriched over the years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, squirrels and pigs have become "permanent guests", and the national secondary protection of animal patches "screening rate" is also increasing.
Zhang Zhi Ming, director of the Department of Wildlife and Wetlands Protection of the Beijing City Gardens Greening Bureau, said that Beijing's land-based vertebrate wildlife has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and Beijing's wildlife species and number has continued to increase in recent years.
The appearance of wildlife in cities is becoming increasingly common and is closely related to the escalation of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, a new round of 1 million acres of forestry and green construction began in 2018, which proposed to restore the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of forest and green land, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
Planned to interaction with surrounding green areas, facilitate wild animals to "go close friends", the trees of the species are also the animal's beloved honey source and food source plants.
I am dedicated to assisting computers in communicating with the world around us.
There are many ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers talk about what they see and understand.
Given such scenarios, a modern computer vision algorithm can tell you that there is a woman and there is a dog.
It could tell you that the woman was smiling.
It can even tell you that this dog is very cute.
I deal with the question of thinking about how humans understand and coexist with the world.
Those thoughts, memories, and stories in such scenes may attract human attention.
The interrelationship of all situations.
Maybe you’ve seen such dogs before, or you’ve ever spent time running on such a sandy beach, and further evoked the memories and thoughts of past holidays, before going to the beach, when spending time with other dogs, running to run out.
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers understand what experiences are and thus understand what we believe and feel in common, we have the ability to start developing computer technology in a way that complements our experiences.
So, digging deeper into this, I started working a few years ago to help computers generate human-like stories from image sequences.
So one day, I was working on a computer, asking it about the trip to Australia.
He looked at the pictures and saw a bag of bears.
It doesn’t know what a tree bag bear is, but the computer says it thinks a tree bag bear looks like a funny creature.
Then I shared a series of images with the computer about the house burned.
The computer looked at the picture and said, “This is a stunning landscape!
It makes my back cold.
Computers see a terrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and think it’s a positive thing.
I realized that computers recognized the red and yellow contrast and thought it was something worth a positive assessment.
Partly because most of the images I entered on the computer were positive.
That’s because when people talk about their experiences, they tend to share positive images.
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?
I realized that in the process of improving artificial intelligence, it is task to task, data set to data set, in the understanding of computers, creating huge gaps, flaws and blind spots.
While doing this, I’m coding for various prejudices.
Prejudice reflects a limited view, derived from a set of data – which reflects the same things as humans, such as biases and stereotypes.
I recall the development of the technology that brought me to where I was that day—the first color image was calibrated for a white woman’s skin colour, which means that color photography deviates from the black face.
And the same deviation, that blind spot continued to bring into the 90s.
The same blind spot even today, still exists in the application of facial recognition technology, how to recognize different faces.
In today’s study, I think of the most advanced technologies, both of which tend to limit our thoughts to a set of data and a problem.
And doing so, we are creating more blind spots and biases that will be further amplified when using artificial intelligence.
Then I realized that we had to think about how we invented the technology we create today and how it will be seen in five to ten years.
In the interaction between humans and the environment, humans use time to correct problems, so the evolution is slow.
In contrast, artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible rate.
That means it’s really important that we now carefully consider this—reflect on our blind spots, and prejudices, and consider how these prejudices have affected the technologies we create now, and discuss what today’s technologies mean for the future.
CEOs and scientists have weighed their thoughts on the future of AI development.
Stephen Hawking warned: “Artificial intelligence will destroy humanity.”
Elon Musk warned that this is an existential risk and one of the greatest risks to us as civilized societies.
Bill Gates said, “I don’t understand why people are less concerned about AI.”
But those views—are just part of the story.
That mathematics, models, these basic components of artificial intelligence, are all we can obtain and use.
We have open source tools for the public to learn machines and make their own contributions at the same time.
In addition, we can also share our experience.
We can share where technology is and its relationship with us, and how it makes us passionate.
We can talk about what we love.
We can communicate with the foreseeable future, about the technical aspects that may be more useful, or over time, more issues that may arise.
If we all focus on opening up to AI discussions and looking forward to the future, this will help create a routine conversation and awareness about what AI is, what it can be, and everything we need to do to the results that best suit us.
We have seen and understood this in the technologies we use today.
We use smartphones, digital assistants and automatic vacuum cleaners.
Are they evil?
Or maybe sometimes.
Are they useful?
Yes, they are too.
They are not entirely the same.
There you have already seen the light of the future.
The future will continue to start with what we build and create now.
We launched the domino effect, which opens up the evolution of artificial intelligence.
In our time, it shapes the artificial intelligence of tomorrow.
Let us immerse ourselves in the technology of augmented reality to revive the world of the past.
When people find it difficult to communicate, technology helps them share experiences with each other.
Based on the technology of online visual media, it can be used on self-driving cars.
Technology generates language based on image understanding, which can evolve into technologies that assist people with visual impairments and help them have a better visual world.
We also see how technology leads to some problems.
We have technology today to analyze the physical features we are born with—such as the color of our skin or the expressions on our faces—to determine whether we are criminals or terrorists.
We have the technology for processing data, processing data about gender or race, to determine whether we are able to obtain a loan.
Everything we see now is just a snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.
Because where we are now is a moment of evolution.
This means that what we do now will affect the future of things and extend to the world of the future.
If we want artificial intelligence to help humans evolve in a way, we need to define strategies and goals to open that path right away.
I want to see what is suitable for human culture and environmental development direction.
Technology can help us cure patients with nervous system disorders or other disabilities, making them as challenging as everyone else.
The operation of technology does not take into account your characteristics or skin color.
Today I am concerned about tomorrow’s technology and the next decade.
Artificial intelligence can appear in many different ways.
But in this case, it is not without any destination for a driverless car.
This is a car that we can drive at the same time.
We choose when to accelerate and when to slow down.
We choose whether to turn.
What we choose will be the future of artificial intelligence.
There will be a vast arena, allowing artificial intelligence to be everything.
It will become a lot of different things.
Now it’s up to us to figure out what needs to be implemented to ensure the results of AI are better for all humans.
thank you .
and applause
Black land "seeds" out of agricultural modernization - China network
Xinhua news agency Harbin July 26th: Black land "seeds" out of agricultural modernization
In the summer, two spray medicinal aircraft passed through the thousands of acres of high-production demonstration fields from the fifth management district of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the "first in the sky" with black rice planted in the green field was seen in several large letters.
The head of the operations station,孔令强, said that this aircraft can spray drugs on more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, which is about eight times more efficient than drones, which is hundreds of times more than man-made.
This farm is located in the territory of the first food-producing province of China, Hengjiang Province Friendship County, from the cutting of rice from the past to today's "Ronglong" motor sound, Chinese traditional agriculture and farms in this black ground band to realize the transformation.
In addition to aircraft, satellites were also used in modern agricultural production at Friendship Farms.
On the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardization of field operations in agricultural machinery.
During this year’s rice production, the farm has expanded the operating area of satellite-navigated unmanned plug-in technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes the planting more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves 16 yuan per hectare of labor costs.
Farms in agricultural production attempted to informational, intelligent and other new technologies, forming China's largest agricultural machinery group from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total ownership of farm machinery is 490,000 units (pieces), and the overall mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operation achieved GPS satellite navigation 100%, dry field precision sowing 100%, dry field machinery operation 100%.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the pathways to modernization of agriculture.”
Friendship farmer Liu Liu said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, the modern large agricultural "aircraft carrier" played a demonstration and leading role, and initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by scale cultivation, standardization of production and industrialization.
In the outskirts of Friendship County, there is a 350,000 square meters of farm machinery exhibition park.
The exhibition focuses on more than 140 (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Chernobyl over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farms witnessed the development of modern agriculture in our country.
Shelby House for All — — Anguilla Joint Chengdu River Joint Chengdu Mass Transfer Direct Shot - China Network
Xinhua news agency Jinhua July 26th Topic: Shenzhen for everyone — — Anguilla Jinhua Jiangsu River Jinhua mass transfer direct strike
Xinhua news agency reporters Chen Shan Camp, Wang Liu Wu, Liu Xiaobo Village
At about 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Qingbao, wearing clay-filled clothes, went from the front to the back of the house, and his wife Zhou Yuan came back and packed things.
“Receiving the call of the village cadres to transfer, I am still in the field.”
Fu Qingbao said that he has flowed more than 60 acres of land, planted rice, and the situation is good right now, "Yesterday I also beat the medicine, and the tools have not been packed."
Fukuoka pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, "No one wants to be flooded in the house, leave the small house for everyone."
In response to the continuing high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall, Anguilla Province's Feng Shui City is preparing to activate the floodwater separation of Chiang Mai River Union, where Fu Qing Bao is located, on the 26th.
Chiang Mai River Union is located in肥西 county, close to the nest lake.
There are thousands of villagers involved in the strict shop and three river towns that need to be relocated.
As of 16 a.m., the water level of China's fifth largest freshwater lake nest stillins at 13.2 meters, and the water level is 0.7 meters.
Fukuoka's kitchen was clean and clean, with a bowl of cabbage on the table, with eggs and some snacks in the refrigerator.
"I didn't think to move, the water of Chiang Mai River now looks good."
Zhou Yuan said that the house is a flat house, and some large objects have not yet thought where to put them.
“Pack up precious items first, the refrigerator, television and other large items can be temporarily placed in the house of the high neighbors or relatives.”
The village officials gave Foucault an idea.
Wang Chuan is responsible for the relocation of 13 villagers, a notification from one household to the other, confirming each person's relocation plan.
The nearest settlement from Fukuoka is the primary school, which is about 2 km away.
In addition to the big things, Foucault had two headaches and more than 1,000 kilograms of food and some newly purchased furniture at home.
“Food ready to drag to relatives’ homes, the furniture cannot be moved.”
The couple agreed to put a chair under the newly bought bed and raise the bed about half a meter high.
At 6 p.m., Fouqing Bao began to transport things to his relatives with three wheels, and Zhou Yuan continued to pack up at home.
At more than 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked back and forth in the house, pulled the power gate, ready to go to the place.
“Let the water go away sooner.”
Foucault said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, reporters at the site of Chiang Kai-shek River Unity saw that local preparations for the flood had been made.
Zhang after Colin's house team has a strong muscle boy - New China Network
Sports teen hot-blood competition show "Sports Bar Boys" officially landed in Hunan Guard on July 11.
The sport leader Zhang Zhengko and the sport assistant Lin Huai crossed the border, Lindan and Feng Shui commented on the various styles, and the hard core of the force pulling device like "big things" appeared, making the program "burn" full of strength.
The first focus, 11 sports teenagers made their debut on the power track, the appearance of stunning live audiences at the same time, the "strong conflict" "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the stadium were also paid attention.
Among them, "Strong Conflict" comes from Super A athlete Jovan I, who openly provocated Xu Zhibin, who is called "Flower Beautiful Man" in the course before the game, and the shadow conditions of Xu Zhibin should go to the dance program, and even release the bad words of "not losing makeup and crying."
The first speech let the youths and sports leaders in the field breathe a cold breath.
And the "strong confrontation" is more like the godfather fighting, known as the "great monk king" Sun Kenshi encountered the same strong strength of Zhang Xin, playing a strong confrontation.
And their identity is also unexpected, Sun Kenze is a fitness-loving actor, and Zhang Xinboon is a retired special team member and a three-time warrior medal recipient.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small stick, and the persistent confrontation on the big stick made the scene audience sweat for them.
In the tense conditions, Zhang Zuko, as one of the leaders of the "Sports Bar Boys" movement, is also seriously watching the battle.
In the review section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the losing side of the teenager, helping to recalculate every mistake in the process.
Athletics assistant Lin Little House is a flower-style assistant, she does not hide the admiration of the teenagers who value power online.
It is even more admirable to learn about the daily training of sports teenagers overloaded.
Similarly, the leadership of the movement, Lindan and Feng Shui, each has a style, one is the "prophecy" of the defiant divinity, and the other is the "thunder girl" who disperses the tension with a smile.
In addition, Gick and Liu as sports assistants, also created a lot of joke themes around sports teenagers.
French Nantes church fire: diocese volunteers confess to firing
According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the religious and historical architectural treasures of France's Nantes, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul's Cathedral, were severely damaged in a fire, and the violin was completely destroyed.
On Monday, local time, Attorney General Nantes announced that a diocesan volunteer in charge of defending the cathedral had been charged with the accusation of “fired destruction.”
He admitted he had set fire to the church.
Local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda confessed to having set fire to three of the cathedrals during the night.
The man’s lawyer said the firefighters now regret doing so.
A few years ago, he entered France by means of an asylum, where he received refuge in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken into a church.
The prosecutor noted that he recently tried to update his visa and was in conversation with the police station about it.
But the church said it was still unbelievable that the usual very kind, smiling, but not very speaking believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the July 18 fire, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for logical issues in the narrative, but he was later released.
Rescue for firefighters at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was again interrogated because of new evidence obtained by professional engineers at the Paris Central Police Laboratory.
This time, the man acknowledged his fire.
According to reports, if the crime of deliberately firing destruction is established, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The fire caused serious damage to the St. Pierre and St. Paul Cathedrals, the violin inside the church was completely burned, and the colored glass windows behind the violin were also severely damaged.
Bruno, the chief architect of the French historical preservation building, said conservatives estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral would take at least three years.
U.S. unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's counter-operation with the U.S.
On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry notified the U.S. Embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to withdraw the permission to establish and operate the U.S. Consulate General in Chongqing and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States cause serious trouble to the relations between the two countries, China responds to unreasonable provocations by the United States, and countermeasures are justified and necessary.
Andrés Borkes, director of the Center for China Studies at the Institute for International Affairs at the University of Chile, said that U.S. unilateralism undermined the bridge of understanding between the people of the two countries and put the relationship between the two great powers in crisis.
China's notification of the closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu is in response to unilateral measures against the U.S. and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Archaeological Studies, believes that the Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations of the United States and is not aimed at the ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to shift the attention of the American people by pressuring China to the goal of masking its inability to cope with the new coronavirus.
Ban Ban Suljono, chairman of the Asia Innovation Research Center at the Indonesian think tank, said that the U.S. took a provocative diplomatic gesture, causing serious trouble to the relations between the two countries, and the relationship between the two countries faces serious challenges.
China's notification of the closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chongqing is a normal countermeasure, in accordance with diplomatic practice, which reflects both China's resolute principled position of safeguarding its own interests, and the reasonable and advantageous aspects of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian news commentator Francis Semvenza said China’s decision was a legitimate and necessary response to U.S. provocations.
In order for China-US relations to return to normal, the United States should proactively improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to win with China economically and politically and benefit the people of both countries and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, the executive director of the Sudan-based Arab-Chinese Friendship Association Federation, said China's compelled countermeasures were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States, in accordance with the basic norms of international law and international relations, and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the U.S. demanded that the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will revoke the previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for the return of normal relations between the two countries.
Singapore's United Morning Post that the United States' greater strategic intention is to encircle China and prevent China from continuing its rise.
Faced with the rapid pace of the United States, although China is reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has had to take countermeasures.

Xinhua news agency Guangzhou, July 26, (reporter Mao Xin) reporter from the Guangzhou Sea Police Bureau learned that recently, the agency joined Guangzhou Customs and public security departments, defeated a major smuggling of finished oil gang, preliminary inspection of the gang since 2019 smuggled about 120,000 tons of finished oil, the case value of about 800 million yuan, tax evasion of about 2,4 billion yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Office and the customs search department jointly gradually clarified the group's personnel division and organizational structure.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs, and public security departments in Guangzhou, Fujian and other places, as well as in the waters of Pearl River, carried out unified networking operations, seized 4 vessels suspected of smuggling, seized a total of 4,700 tons of finished oil in the vessels and warehouses involved, and froze a batch of funds accounts.
It is understood that the joint operation mobilized eight ships and two helicopters, divided into several operational groups, and conducted a chain of strikes on marine smuggling and illegal operations on land, all 35 major criminal suspects.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, combat all kinds of illegal crime and smuggling activities at sea, and maintain good order in the waters of the jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hana" landed in Midtown or triggered river surge and mountain floods
On 25 July, local time at 5 p.m., Hurricane "Hana" landed in the U.S. state of Texas, which will bring to the state strong storms, rivers rise, and may also cause life-threatening mountain floods.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to wreak heavy rains, sweep down parts of the state's south and northeast, raining or causing some of the streams to rise and life-threatening mountain floods.
According to the report, the most severely affected by Hurricane Hannah is the area south of Corpus Christi to the Grand River Canyon, where large-scale floods could erupt in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said: “Any hurricane is a huge challenge.”
Twenty-two counties have declared a state of emergency due to the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi, with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums.
Abbott said the hurricane could no longer cause more casualties in the state as the state is suffering from a new coronavirus.
Rainfall is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches in southern Texas during the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches in northern Texas and Louisiana coastal areas will also be expected.
Due to factors such as global warming, "Hannah" formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women.
The right-wing Polish government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students gender-related topics, undermining the rights of students’ parents.
Polish Attorney-General Zbigniew Zbigniew Zbigniew said at a press conference that the Ministry of Justice under his leadership would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawal from the treaty.
The treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
He said, “The treaty contains some elements of a moral nature that we think is harmful.”
The ruling Law and Justice Party of Poland and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda has called hostility to homosexual rights one of the main topics during the successful re-election campaign this month.
Tens of thousands of Poles (mostly women) marched in Warsaw and several other cities on Friday to protest the withdrawal from the convention.
Lempart, one of the organizers of the protests, said in a demonstration in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawal from the treaty was to legalize domestic violence.”
Some of the protesters held banners with the inscription “Law and Justice is a women’s hell.”
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
The former Polish intermediate government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice government said the treaty did not respect religion and demanded that liberal social policies be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Jiangxi opens a "green channel" for youth entry into the front line of anti-Hungary
Xinhua news agency Nanjing, July 26 (Guang Wintermin, Bear Hyun) The Jianxi People's Government Recruitment Office recently made clear that the individuals or their children who showed outstanding performance in this flood rescue and disaster rescue mission meet the conditions for recruitment, and both qualify for medical examination and political assessment, give priority to the appointment of troops.
"After the registration of the eligible youth, we will jointly establish the community where the eligible youth is, the street armed ministry and the Yuan district after verification of the military recruitment, and prioritize the military."
Wang Huizhi, deputy minister of the People's Armed Forces Ministry of Jiangsu District, said that due to the flooding, they began to focus on three days to organize the medical examination of young people.
Chongqing District of Chongqing is a 22-year-old university graduate, his mother is a community employee, his father is a veteran of the Air Force, and his parents have been on duty on the flood-resistant front for ten days.
"These days, in the news, seeing the people's brothers and sisters struggling to defend their homeland on the front line against the flooding, I also want to be like them."
Zhou Rongfeng said that he had a dream of military from a childhood, and through this resistance flooded more firmly his determination to enter the military camp.
In addition, the city of Jiangsu also uses the rescue risk as a "living teaching material" for the propaganda of recruitment, and calls on recruitment youths to voluntarily participate in patrol and attendance tasks, to realise the nature of the people's army, and to strengthen their confidence in joining the army.
Cam Nenyu, the people's and military ministry of the Zhejiang district, said that by prioritizing the military, we hope to inspire more young people to be recruited and create a good social atmosphere in which they can participate in the mission with glory and participate in the military with glory.
According to Grivory, Vietnam has made a huge contribution to the development of ASEAN over the past 25 years.
Vietnam is not only a responsible member of ASEAN, but also the train head of ASEAN.
Grivory said that Russia and even the Asia-European Economic Union believed that Vietnam contributed to enhancing its status and promoting its image.
He stressed that “ASEAN should therefore thank Vietnam.”
Grivory said analysts have endorsed the peace initiative put forward by Vietnam.
Vietnam is willing to share its experience with ASEAN countries and propose constructive peaceful measures to address the problems facing the Asia-Pacific region, including the East Sea issue.
Regarding the cooperation between Vietnam and Russia within the ASEAN framework, Gryvory believes that Vietnam supports the cooperation between Russia and ASEAN, helping Russia to gain benefits from this cooperation framework.
The Asian and European Economic Union, including Russia, will be able to enter the ASEAN market after signing a free trade agreement with Vietnam.
Grivory suggested maximizing the expansion of the free trade zone between the Asian and European Economic Union and ASEAN countries, thereby creating a platform for economic and security stability.
At the same time, Grivory believes that Russia, Vietnam and ASEAN are on track and will their goals.
From now until the end of 2020, the province will have the necessary conditions, especially in terms of infrastructure, human resources and land, to actively accommodate the flow of foreign capital, especially transnational groups with value chains and transfer of advanced technology.
In addition, the province will handle the submission to the Prime Minister of the Government of the decision on the investment in infrastructure construction and operation projects in the Vietnam-Korea Industrial Zone and the approval of the addition of the two industrial-city-service industries of the province of Anshan-North and Amun to the document on the overall development plan of the Vietnam-Korea Industrial Zone until 2020.
At the same time, the province is focusing on accelerating the progress of various projects, especially in the construction and operation of infrastructure projects in the industrial park clusters such as Zhongjiang, Guangzhou, Dongguan-Nei, and other industrial park clusters, to form a land fund for hiring investment.
In 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the province of Jiangsu decided to set up plans for industrial zones and industrial clusters in order to incorporate them into provincial planning.
The province has determined that the development of industrial park clusters will be combined with ensuring national defense security, protecting the ecological environment and ensuring food security, thereby promoting the balanced development of industry; having comprehensive electricity, water supply, transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, and combined with urban construction, trade services, workers' housing and medical and healthcare, education and other social infrastructure.
In the industrial district, the province of Jiangsu focuses on calling for investment projects in high-tech, clean technologies in the fields of electricity, electronics, telecommunications equipment, precision machinery, auxiliary industries and other areas.
In the industrial park cluster, the province calls for small and medium-sized investment projects in the fields of production and employment of local labor, especially agricultural products and food processing.
In the future, the province will focus on accelerating investment in the infrastructure of the logistics center of the city, synchronizing with the development of the industrial park cluster, to optimize the circulation of goods and money and help reduce production costs, improve the value of goods, optimize the supply chain, and develop multi-modal transportation, thereby creating attractiveness for investors to invest in the province.
Upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter card-52M first in factory at the end of the year
According to the plans of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as the "Wojski") Ka-52 - the Ka-52M will be completed for the first time in December this year and the factory, the model will have a major improvement in reconnaissance, communication and weapons performance.
According to the Russian "Sputnik" reports, the Wukong-52M named "super short-kissed crocodile", its development contract was signed in April last year by the Russian military and military-industrial units, currently the first two of the upgraded version of the Wukong is undergoing the transformation of the Far East helicopter manufacturing plant of the Russian "progressive" aerospace group, its national test and improvement work will end before October 2022.
According to the Russian experts of the above upgrading work, the "predecessor" of the "super short-kissed crocodile" - the Wukiji Ka-52 was officially assembled in November 2011, the model exposed some weaknesses in use, the upgrade was to "supplement the short board".
Compared to the Kar-52, the Kar-52M will partly adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight, its pilot cabin will be reinforced, equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival on the battlefield; assembly of more powerful generators to power more sophisticated airborne electronic equipment; upgrading of the optical system, capable of detecting and identifying more distant battlefield targets; equipped with the main attack armoured vehicles and steel concrete defense works, the new lightweight multi-purpose missile, its range of 20 kilometers, the range of similar missiles in Russian direct use increased about one time; its defense weapons and communications equipment will be maximized with the attack air targets M-28NM armed helicopter, so that the maintenance becomes easy and economical.
In addition, the Kar-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is of concern that the Kar-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with the drone, so that in real time in the air to obtain the nearby drone transmission intelligence, such as displaying images taken by the drone on the cabin screen of the helicopter.
As planned, the pilots of the Ka-52M will be able to directly operate the aircraft that supports it, thereby improving the pilot's grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Deputy Defense Minister Krivolucko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Tupolev-52Ms by 2027.
The new decree stipulates that from now on, the Campania district must wear masks in indoor public places, and violators can be punished with a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Italian capital Rome, the Roman Fighting Field reopened.
According to the latest vaccination law issued by the regional government, people in Campania are required to wear masks in accordance with the requirements of vaccination in all public transportation, as well as in indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibitions.
Violation of this regulation can be punished with a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all travellers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania area must be isolated.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate arrangements for specific hotels to isolate people with no positive symptoms.
The decree comes into effect on July 25.
Within less than an hour, three customers who had entered the supermarket had been fined.
Since this year, Hubei has supplied 17.5 million cubic meters of ecological water to the river lake.
Xinhua news agency Jinhua, July 26, (reporter Wang Kun) reporter from the Hubei Provincial Water Administration learned that since this year, Hubei province has combined the use of river water and local reservoir water, and successively implemented 28 rivers and white ocean starch eco-supplementation to the Chongqing river, the Tang river, the Chongqing river and other rivers, and cumulative completion of the river lake eco-supplementation 17.5 million cubic meters.
Hebei Province tightly seized the favorable time for the Southern Water North-Tuning Midline Project to increase the flow of water, and implemented ecological water supplementation using river water to the rivers of the Tang River, the Sand River and the Dragon River.
Meanwhile, using nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as the West Ocean and East Fushan and White Ocean Strain, ecological water supplementation has been implemented to the rivers such as the Yangtze River and Qingdao River, and a cumulative water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers has been formed.
In order to do a good job of ecological water supply, the Hubei Provincial Water Administration actively organizes the discharge of hidden risks of water supply rivers, repair, reinforcement and riverway cleaning work, fine-tuning implementation measures, and strengthening inspection and control.
Through supervisory inspections and concentrated dark visits, all kinds of problems are solved in a timely manner, and the water supply of the river is safely and orderly.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hubei Provincial Water Administration, the orderly implementation of the ecological water supply of the river lakes has effectively restored the ecological environment of the river lakes in the province of Hubei, promoted the recovery and conservation of coastal groundwater, greatly improved the habitat environment and economic development environment along the line, and has an important significance for the realization of the river lake management protection goals of "water clean, shore green, river smooth and scenic".
You should all know the facts I am talking about.
I think that the instinct that inequality can cause social division and corruption existed before the French Revolution.
The difference is that we can now find evidence that we can understand the effects of inequalities by comparing societies, equally different societies.
I’ll show you some of the data and explain why the data actually exists.
But first, let’s see how hard our lives are.
(Laughter) I want to start my speech with a contradiction.
This chart shows the ratio of our average life expectancy to gross national income—the latter is measured by the average wealth of a country.
You can look at those countries on the right, like Norway and the United States, which are twice as wealthy as Israel, Greece, and Portugal on the left.
However, this does not affect their average life expectancy.
There are no signs of interrelationship.
But if we look inside societies, we can find great health differences within societies as a whole.
This chart shows the average lifespan.
These are the small towns of England and Wales—the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.
There is a huge difference between the poor and others.
Even those who are right below the top have worse health conditions than those who are at the top.
So income means a lot in our society, but comparisons between different societies don’t make sense.
The explanation of that contradiction is that in our society, we look at the relative income, or social status, identity—that is, the relationship between us and the magnitude of the gap between people.
Once you have that idea, you should immediately think: What if the gap widened? what if the gap widened? what if the income gap widened or reduced?
That’s what I want to tell you right away.
I did not use any hypothetical data.
My data from the United Nations — and from the World Bank — is about the income gap between these wealthy, developed democracies.
The method we used, easy to understand, and you can download, is to compare the income gap between the top 20% of each country and the last 20%.
You can see that the countries on the left are more equal—Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden—their top 20 percent are probably 3.5 to 4 times richer than the latter 20 percent.
But on the other side of comparative inequality – Britain, Portugal, the United States, and Singapore – the income gap is twice as large.
In this comparison, our country (UK) has twice as much inequality as other equally successful democratic markets.
Next, I’ll show you how this affects our society.
We gather data on issues arising from differences within societies, which are more and more common in the lowest levels of society.
International comparable data include average life expectancy, children’s mathematical and linguistic achievements, infant mortality, suicide rates, prison population percentage, teenage pregnancy rate, mutual trust, obesity, mental illness – all of which meet standard diagnostic classifications including drug and alcohol addiction – and social mobility rates.
We put all of this in a coefficient.
They are all weighted on average.
A country’s score is the average of these factors.
You can see that these scores are related to the inequalities I just showed, and I’ll show them again and again.
The more unequal countries are, the worse they perform on various social issues.
Connectivity is very strong.
But if you look at the same health and social issues compared to the per capita national income and the GNI index, then you will find nothing, no more relevance.
We have a bit of concern that people might think we are selecting specific questions to meet our theory and then artificial evidence. So we also published a paper on the United Nations Children’s Fund’s Child Welfare Index in the British Journal of Medicine.
It contains 40 different sections, summarized by others.
It includes whether children can talk to their parents, whether there are books at home, how much immunity rates are, and whether there is bullying in school.
Everything is included.
This is how the index is related to the same level of inequality.
The more inequal societies, the worse the performance of children.
Relationships and their significance.
But again, if you look at the relationship between child welfare and per capita national income, you will get nothing.
All the data I present to you now reveal is the same thing.
The average well-being of our society is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.
They are very important in poorer countries, but not for wealthy developed countries.
And the difference between us and our place in relation to others seems to be very important today.
Below, I will show you some of the sections of our index.
This is an index of mutual trust.
It refers to the percentage of people who agree that the majority is credible.
This is according to the World Values Survey.
You can see that on the more unequal side, about 15% of people feel they can trust others.
But in more equal societies, this percentage rose to 60% or 65%.
If you look at the level of community engagement or the assessment of social capital, there is a very similar association with inequality.
I mean, we repeated this work twice.
The first was aimed at these wealthy developed countries, and then we replaced the subjects and repeated the test for 50 U.S. states — the same question: Do the more inequal states do the worse on all of these assessments?
This is the relationship between mutual trust and inequality found by the federal government in a general social survey.
Very similar scatter distribution within a similar confidence range.
The same thing continues.
Basically, we found that almost all of the factors related to mutual trust reflected in international surveys were also reflected in the 50 states we investigated separately.
This is not coincidence.
This picture is a mental illness.
By random sampling using the same diagnostic interview approach, the World Health Organization gathers data that allows us to compare the rates of mental illness in each society.
This is the percentage of the population suffering from any type of mental illness in the previous year.
It ranges from 8% to more than 24%—which suggests that the proportion of mental illnesses in the whole society is three times higher than in other societies.
These are also closely linked to inequality.
This is the crime rate.
The red point represents the states of the United States, and the blue triangle represents the provinces of Canada.
But look at the difference in numbers.
The murder rate ranged from 15 to 150 per million.
This is the percentage of prisoners.
This is 10 times the gap, and the index function increases the gap.
But the number of prisoners varies from 40 to 400.
Crime is not the main cause of this relationship.
In some places, crime can explain some of the reasons.
But there are more tough trials, or even tougher trials.
The more inequal society is, the more inclined it is to retain the death penalty.
This picture is the state of children's high school leaving.
Also, the gap is large.
If we discuss the selection of social talents, we will find that the danger of this gap is very serious.
This is the social mobility rate.
In fact, it is a calculation of liquidity based on income.
Basically, what it asks is: Do rich dads have rich children and poor dads have poor children, or is there no connection between the two?
On the side of more inequality, the father’s income is more important—for example, Britain, the United States.
In Northern Europe, father’s income is less important.
There are more social movements.
As we often say – I know there are a lot of American listeners here – if Americans want to realize their “American Dream,” they should go to Denmark.
(Laughter) (Applause) I’ve shown here with slanted words.
I can also show some other issues.
These problems are more prevalent at the bottom of the social ladder.
But there are endless problems with social gradients, which seem worse in countries with inequalities—not just a little worse, but everything twice as much as ten times worse.
Think of the cost, the cost of human resources.
I’d like to go back to this previously shown chart We put it all together to explain the two.
First, through a graph one by one, we found that those countries that performed worse, whatever, seemed to be those that were more unequal, but those that performed well seemed to be both Nordic and Japan.
So what we see is the relationship between universal social disorder and inequality.
Not just one or two things, but almost everything.
Another very important point I want to point out on this picture is that if you look at the bottom, Switzerland and Japan, they show that they are very different countries in all respects.
The status of women, and the extent to which they adhere to small families, in the wealthy developed countries, are at two extremes.
But another very important difference is how they greater equality.
Sweden has huge income differences, but it cuts the gap with taxes, national benefits, generous relief, and so on.
Japan is quite different.
The Japanese pre-tax wage gap is relatively small.
Its taxes are lower.
The benefits are also less.
And in the study of the United States states, we found striking comparisons.
Some states performed better through redistribution, while others performed better because the pre-tax income gap was small.
So we come to the conclusion that it is not important how greater equality can be achieved; it is important that equality can be achieved.
I’m not talking about absolute equality, I’m talking about what really exists in wealthy, developed market democracies.
Another unexpected thing about this chart is that not only the poor will be affected by inequality.
The words of John Dorn seem to be somewhat true: “No one is an isolated island.”
Through a series of studies, we were able to compare the behavior of people of every social class in more or less equal degrees in different countries.
This is just an example.
This figure is the infant mortality rate.
According to the British General Socioeconomic Classification Record, some Swedes have very kindly classified many infant deaths.
This is a classification based on the father’s position that doesn’t fit the times, so single mothers make up a set of data.
But we look at the so-called “social lower classes,” which is manual work that doesn’t require technology.
The middle is the manual work that requires technology, and then to the advanced non-manual work, and up to professional work - doctors, lawyers, managers of large companies.
Here it can be seen that Sweden is doing better than Britain, doing better in every social class.
The biggest differences appear at the bottom of society.
But even at the top, living in a more equal society has some advantages.
We showed 5 different sets of data including U.S. and international educational outcomes and health status.
In general, the differences that more equal societies exhibit are most evident at the bottom, but there are also some advantages at the upper.
I have to explain what happened.
I think I’m demonstrating and discussing the impact of inequality on social psychology.
More focused on the sense of superiority and inferiority, being valued and disregarded, being respected and degraded.
Of course, those feelings arising from the competition of identity status drive the advance of social consumerism.
But it also leads to status uncertainty.
We are more concerned about how others judge and view us, whether we look attractive, smart, or the like.
Social values increase the fear of these social values.
Interestingly, some similar work is also underway in the field of social psychology: some people consulted 208 different studies; in the study, volunteers were invited to a psychological trial center and then tested for their stress hormones and their responses when they performed stress tasks.
In this observation, scientists are interested in which stress increases the body’s levels of cortisol, the most important stress hormone.
The result is precisely those tasks that include social assessment of threats – tasks that threaten self-esteem and social status – in which others can negatively evaluate your performance.
These stresses have a very special effect on stress physiology.
We have already received criticism.
Of course, some people don’t like this, and some find it unexpected.
However, I should tell you that when people criticize us for provoking data, we never did that.
We have an unconditional provision if our data source contains data from the observed countries, then we incorporate it into the analysis.
Our data source determines whether the data is valid, not us.
Otherwise, there will be deviations.
What about other countries?
In academic peer-reviewed journals, there are 200 studies on the relationship between health and income and equality.
This is not limited to these countries here, hiding a very simple proof.
The same country the same method of measuring inequality, the problem one by one.
Why don’t we control other factors?
I’ve shown you that per capita national income has no impact.
Of course, others have applied more sophisticated methods in the literature to exclude factors such as poverty and education in experiments.
What about Causal Relationship?
Relevance by itself does not prove a causal relationship.
We spent a lot of time.
Indeed, people have a good understanding of the causality of our outcomes.
The biggest change in our understanding of the drivers of long-term health in wealthy developed countries is the importance of long-term pressure from society on immune and cardiovascular systems.
Or, for example, the reason that violence is becoming more and more prevalent in less equal countries is because people are very sensitive to being disregarded.
I want to say that in order to solve this problem, we should address a series of post-tax and pre-tax issues.
We should limit income and curb the top-notch bonus income culture.
I think we must do everything we can to make our leaders accountable to their employees.
Finally, what I want to summarize is that we can improve our real quality of life by reducing our income gaps.
In this way, we’ll find that we’ve suddenly solved the social and mental health problems of the whole society, and that’s great.
thank you .
and applause
Over the past two weeks, new coronavirus cases in Spain have rebounded dramatically, with thousands of new cases appearing over the course of days.
The British government on Saturday evening (July 25) made a temporary decision to remove Spain from the list of safe travelers starting from zero on 26 local time, and those entering the UK from Spain must be isolated for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain were surprised, worried, and even angry at the decision, as the news came suddenly.
Transport Minister Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain.
Prior to the UK’s isolation measures, Norway had also announced that those who returned to Norway from Spain would undergo 10 days of isolation.
France and Belgium have advised residents of their own countries to abandon their plans for vacation in Barcelona and the surrounding area.
The beaches in these areas are crowded, and people can’t keep social distance, and police have to take steps to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain is safe here.
Responding to Britain’s decision, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said: “Spain is safe, not only for the Spaniards, but also for tourists.”
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in both tourist destinations is much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Spanish region of Catalonia has also resumed the "barrier order".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular vacation destinations for British tourists.
The UK’s decision is expected to affect Spain’s tourism industry heavily.

The FAA may have ordered an emergency inspection of 2,000 Boeing aircraft.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, due to the air-stop valve corrosion of the above passenger aircraft could cause the engine to stop in the air.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it has received four reports of airborne stopping of 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft engines so far, and therefore issued an emergency inspection request to check passenger aircraft that have been stalled for seven days or more in a row, and passenger aircraft that have flyed less than 11 times so far after re-launching.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if both of the passenger aircraft's level 5 stop valves were corroded, they could get stuck in the opening position, causing the aircraft to completely lose power and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that, once it was found that the back valve was corroded, air carriers must replace the key component before the aircraft was put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day, the new coronavirus outbreak resulted in reduced travel demand, and many aircraft were therefore blocked or less used, "stop-back valves are more susceptible to corrosion."
Boeing said it had advised air carriers to check the aircraft involved in the instructions, and if problems were found, Boeing would provide assistance in repairs and replacement of stop-back valves.
The aircraft owned by major U.S. air carriers usually fly several times a day, but after the outbreak of the new coronavirus, a large number of aircraft stopped; as the demand for passenger travel has recently slowly increased, some aircraft have re-entered operation.
The Federal Aviation Administration did not publish the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the incidents on the 24th.
The airline said in a statement that a passenger plane on the way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15, suddenly turned off the engine and the aircraft eventually managed an emergency landing at Austin airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engines and inspected the engines of six aircraft in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's instructions.
U.S. airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on Monday that there was no engine shutdown on their aircraft.
Four U.S. Airways aircraft will be checked, while 28 United Airlines aircraft will be checked.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its aircraft, but did not say if there was any engine shutdown.
Several media reports say the Federal Aviation Administration’s emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft was subsequently discontinued worldwide, and production stopped in January this year, and production resumed in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had "committed a mistake" in regulating Boeing on the 737 MAX passenger aircraft.
“Hello Teacher” next week to launch “Knowledge Initiator – New Chinese Network” title.
There is another upper line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program "Gongu on line! teacher hello", will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new youth classroom for all ages, and a group of talented and talented teachers will be on the line to challenge the output of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of previous teachers in the hearts of the crowd, "Gonggong on the line! teacher good" gathered a group of knowledge representatives of color values and talent.
They are both examples of youth knowledge from various disciplines, and a group of all-powerful "parts of hand" who will shake the burden and are good at teaching fun.
In the program, this group of outstanding youth knowledge models as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge the interesting knowledge classroom.
They need to impress the audience by outputting knowledge with attitude, showing the most interesting aspects of their discipline.
And all-age audiences composed of the "there is a question group" site will raise many questions, increase the difficulty of "knowledge sharing officer" lessons, and also add some stimulating atmosphere to the program.
According to the disclosure, the "knowledge sharing officer" of the Chinese people's university affiliated secondary school physics teacher Li Yongle, examination guide famous teacher Zhang Sheng and a ten-year experience in history teacher Wang Li and other outstanding young teachers, they will in an unexpected way to the audience to show the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines.
In addition, the program also invited economics professor Sheng Xiaoping as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, jointly with "Heng Xiaoping Assistant" Du Haitao and Sheng Xiaoping, to talk with the audience about youth, and create "open classes for youth for the whole people".
Head of Government Affairs of the Hong Kong Special Region: The situation is severe All efforts to resist the epidemic
Chinese news agency Hong Kong, July 26, the head of the department of government affairs of the Hong Kong special district government Zhang Jiangsu said on the 26th that the situation of the outbreak of new coronavirus in Hong Kong continues to be severe, if the outbreak deteriorates, the government of the special district will resolutely take stricter control measures, further restrict the operation of business venues and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
But at this stage, the special district government does not intend to introduce a "residence order" or a "prohibition order" to restrict citizens from leaving.
Zhang Qinghui published a webpage entitled "The situation is severe All-powerful Resistance to the Epidemic."
He said the outbreak was the worst in six months, and the next two weeks will be critical to trying to prevent the virus from spreading further across the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the special district government, citizens' self-discipline and cooperation are also very important.
He urged citizens to stay at home as much as possible and to reduce social contact and eating out.
Citizens should protect themselves and others in conjunction with the mandatory measures of wearing masks, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and careful handwashing, and should suspend unnecessary family gatherings or meals and reduce to the street.
He said that the Central Committee has always been very concerned with the changes in the outbreak in Hong Kong and supported the government's prevention and resistance efforts, and actively responded to the latest demands of the Chief Executive, providing assistance in increasing the detection capacity and transforming the Asia International Expo into a similar "quadruple hospital".
Zhang said that the special district government has provided free virus testing for specific high-risk groups, i.e. Annual homes, disabled homes and nursery staff, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property management staff has been fully launched, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about the cases of infection in the Ancient House, and the special district government has arranged a specific temporary sanitation center for Ancient House members.
He said that the special district government is building an isolation detection facility near the Bamboo Bay Detection Center in the Great Oak Hill, and is expected to provide an additional 700 sets of isolation houses by the end of September.
The chief executive also announced on the 19th that the special district government will build more than 2,000 isolated houses at the Bamboo Bay Sanitation Center and strive to be completed by the end of this year.
In addition to the 800 rooms that the isolated sanitation center has already put into use, the Bamboo Bay Sanitation Center is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolated rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four operating isolation sanitation centers in Hong Kong, which provide about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the Government of the Hong Kong Region resumed the resorts on the island of Hong Kong as a community isolation facility for the treatment of patients under the age of 50 who have independent self-care capabilities.
Supplementary Party History, New Chinese History's "Nutrients"

"Sue up Jiangnan" pursuing poetic meaning "Yellow River Dream" - in the new network
(China Poverty Reduction Story) "Shipping up Jiangnan" to pursue the poetic "Yellow River Dream"
Chinese news agency银川 July 26th (Yangdi) "Nine Songs of the Yellow River Vansha, wasted wind from the sky."
The yellow river, which aroused the excitement of countless civilian babies, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia plains, and today, Ningxia, which has the beautiful name "Shipping up Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority, green development", pursuing the poetic "yellow river dream".
The River Dream Show.
The Yellow River, which passes through the Yellow River 397 km, is the "mother river" of the nurturing side.
But with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of river lakes and management protection imbalance, excessive pollution, surrounding lakes and fields, the invasion of waters and other disorders are highlighted, leading to the black smell of the water body, excessive water quality, environmental trouble and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diversification of water ecology, and strives to restore the Yellow River water to the river.
Water must be drawn from the source.
In Ningxia River, the local adoption of the "ticket + pollution treatment + strict management" method, industrial park sewage all realized centralized treatment, urban sewage treatment plants all realized a level A standard emissions, urban building area black odor water basically eliminated, and successfully declared the third batch of China black odor water demonstration city.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river lake long system in 2017, and now has achieved the full coverage of the five-level river lake long system in the countryside of the district and the countryside, and the river lake long cruise has become normal.
A 64-year-old man living in a village on the edge of the Yellow River witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water smelled like before, and after the healing, there was no smell."
Zhang Jin said that the ecological environment is fine, his life is more comfortable, and now he is often with his family to walk along the yellow river and feel the blue sky.
The Wetland Dream.
Flying birds, green trees, stables, steep water... The beauty of the “Sandy Flying Collection” under the pen of Feng Shui has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Ningxia.
Yellow river flow through Ningxia, along the way formed river wetlands, lakes wetlands, swamp wetlands and other wetlands, which has an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, but also became an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, Ningxia related departments have cumulatively invested in wetland protection project funds of approximately RMB 34.5 billion, currently, the area of the wetland of the Guangzhou is 1.92 million hectares, the wetland protection rate reaches 78.5%, there are natural lakes, swamp wetlands 200, has 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland parks, 6 autonomous district level wetland parks, 8 municipal parks.
Liu Qinghua, deputy director of the center for wetland protection in银川, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is evident in birds, "the widow is a endangered bird, only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 in the wetland in银川."
At the same time, Ningxia laid out a red line between 500 meters between the two shores of the Yellow River and Silver River section wetland protection area in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development and construction and business activities within the scope of protection, except for public interest projects.
Zhao Shenyang, deputy director of the water services center in银川, introduced that through the management of pollution sources, the comprehensive repair of the river lake ecology and the construction of end-end wetlands, now the water quality of 9 mainly in the Yellow Drainage Drain has reached the standard of Class IV at 100%, "Now the water is clean, the fish also swims, and the flowers are open."
Drinking water dream.
Ningxia has a "embarging" title: along the Yellow City, the only city "which keeps the Yellow River from drinking."
Since 2010, the city began to face the water shortage problem of the continuous summer peak period, the "water shortage pain" of almost a decade has become the summer experience of many high-rise residents, but under the status quo of large areas of underground underground water over-exploitation leakage areas, the water source shortage has become a problem for the city.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking water after purification has become a good way to solve the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the water administration of the city of银川, introduced that in order to improve the demand for production water for the life of the urban and rural residents of the city of银川, Ningxia timely launched the water supply project of the urban and rural western line of the city of银川 and replaced the original groundwater source with high-quality yellow river water.
On December 29, 2019, the water supply project was officially delivered to the three districts of银川 city, and in 2020, residents of Leningrad and Haran County also drank the yellow river water.
Dingming said that the water supply department will consider the transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply integration, "the next step, we will integrate the rural decentralized water supply points after all access to the western line water supply project, and it is expected to basically realize the urban and rural integration of the water supply of the region of银川 at the end of this year."

The United States launched a counter-subsidy investigation against China for the first time with the "revaluation of the RMB exchange rate"
The U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into products originating in China, and to launch an investigation into the "reduction of the RMB exchange rate" project.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case investigation into the so-called “revaluation of the RMB exchange rate” project in counter-subsidy cases, and China firmly opposes this.
China's Ministry of Commerce said on the evening of the 23rd, China implemented a regulated and managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market played a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
In general, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonably balanced level and has not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has increased its value against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to the data released by the Bank of International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB increased by 38%, the actual effective exchange rate increased by 49%, is the strongest currency in the G20 economies, and is also one of the most valuable currencies globally.
The Ministry of Commerce noted that exchange rate issues go beyond the powers of the members to conduct counter-subsidy investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States, which amended regulations in February to conduct counter-subsidy investigations into foreign exchange rates, has been suspected of violating the WTO rules and has been opposed in many ways.
According to the press release, even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint content has a large number of errors and does not have the necessary elements of counter-subsidy such as financial grants, benefits and focus.
China urges the United States to abide by existing international rules and stop counter-subsidy investigations into the so-called “revaluation of the RMB exchange rate.”
Influenced by the further escalation of tensions between China and the United States, offshore and offshore RMB against the dollar exchange rate decreased once in the 22nd row, and the pair fell to the $ 1 against the RMB at the 7.0 yuan mark.
Whether the U.S. Department of Commerce intends to raise the RMB is a matter of concern.
The current exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar broke the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and collected at 6,9961.
The average exchange rate of the officially regulated people's currency against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basic points on the 24th, reporting 6,9938.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter who “fought for the weakest”
U.S. Congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis was commemorated on Saturday (25 July) as a fighter who “fought for the weakest.”
Lewis’ public memorial has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
On the first day, there were two memorial sessions.
At a public commemoration at the University of Troy, Alabama on Saturday, Lewis’ five siblings and a grandson talked about him as a loving, fearless, family-focused man.
Lewis’ younger brother, Henry “Grant” Lewis, said at the meeting: “He has devoted his whole life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John “do not bother, do not bother.”
He added that John did not listen to his mother’s warning, saying, “We all know that John always gets into trouble, always gets into trouble, but that’s because it’s just the right thing, it’s a good trouble.”
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial that John's most famous argument was to create "good troubles", that is, to avoid provoking things for justice.
John had applied for the University of Troy in his native town of Troy, Alabama, but the University of Troy, then wholly white school, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to the chicken on his own farm as a child, eventually obtained a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a congressman from Alabama, said the current protesters were “protesting peacefully and nonviolently,” as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: “Even if President Trump overthrew a boatman and called all the protesters gangsters, he was wrong.
The protests are patriotic and they want the United States to move toward a more equal country.”
A series of six days of activities commemorating Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis’s coffin was placed on Saturday at a public memorial at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony in a small church in Selma, Alabama, paid tribute to him, followed by a public memorial.
Lewis's body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on Sunday.
In 1965, he and protesters demanding black voting rights were beaten by police in Alabama on this bridge, and police poured tear gas on protesters.
Lewis was killed.
This day is known as the Bloody Sunday.
Lewis’s body will be transported to Alabama’s capital, Montgomery.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to rally on the sidewalk and walk with Lewis on this final trip.
Meanwhile, officials urged the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has ordered the halving of the flag on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the a week-long commemoration, Lewis's body will be briefly placed in the Alabama State Parliament in Montgomery, the Georgia State Parliament in Atlanta, and the U.S. Congress in Washington, D.C. to pay tribute to the public.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could go to Congress this Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, public events to commemorate Lewis will be held outdoors.

Adhering to the leadership of the Party building and implementing the Party's leadership into all aspects of grass-roots governance in all fields is a fundamental requirement to do well with the work of grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of the party building, by strengthening political leadership, building combat fortresses, and consolidating red forces, promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages, and mass work advantages into governance advantages, and pass the party's strength and proposals to the "nerve ends" and "last mile".
Focus on supplementing calcium casts and strengthening political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, we must implement the "calcium cast" project well.
It is necessary to study and understand the socialist thought with Chinese characteristics in Xi Jinping's new era as the primary task, to "do not forget the original heart, keep in mind the mission" as the eternal task of building the party and the lifetime task of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original script, through special training, group training, research exchange, and holding a lecture hall, continue to promote the party's innovative theory armed and practical, promote the party member cadres to further strengthen the "four consciousnesses", firmly "four self-confidence", "two maintenance", and better fulfill their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the learning and education channels, and guide grass-roots party organizations and party members' cadres to truly integrate learning and education into the everyday and grab in the regular.
Focus on practice and exercise, in the process of solving the key difficult issues in the field of grassroots governance, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses' attention, and hammer the party and ability.
Strengthen the norms and build combat fortresses.
Grass-roots party organizations are both an important part of the grass-roots governance system and an important carrier for demonstrating governance capabilities.
To promote the standardization of grass-roots party organizations, we must start from grasp the regulations of the party branch work, focus on the problems of weakening and virtualization of party organization leadership, establishing up-and-down linkage mechanisms, establishing forms for establishing innovative branches, normalizing and correcting weaknesses and dispersions, establishing a sound decision-making and discussion mechanism, and serving the masses mechanisms, and promote development.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of party organizations at the village level, standardize the form of organization, study activities, and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardization of party branch construction standards, and effectively promote the implementation of the "three sessions and one lesson" and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore the form of innovative branch setting, focus on weak areas, "block points", "pain points", and actively build a party-building coalition in cities, so that the party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, the grass-roots governance and governance system mechanisms will be improved, major matters will be discussed, facts will be shared, major matters will be decided, urgent matters will be discussed, difficulties will be resolved, and the decision-making and deliberation mechanisms led by grass-roots party organizations will be improved, and the mass service mechanisms of Party members and cadres will be improved, and the people will be gathered in the service of the people, and the people of the Party members will have a sense of gain, happiness, honour and pride, so that grass-roots governance will be more warm.
Play a pioneering role and unite the red forces.
Grass-roots party cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
Improve grass-roots governance capabilities, focus on improving grass-roots party cadres' governance capabilities, focus on playing the demonstration leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and consolidate red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to enhance the capacity of governance as an obligatory lesson for party cadres at the grassroots level, constantly strengthen the ideological refinement, professional training, and practice exercises, and develop the spirit of responsibility in the positions and difficult and difficult tasks, and solidify the foundation for promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to broadly carry out the "community whistling, party members reporting" activities, participate in community building, management and service by participating in thematic party day activities, connecting difficult people, identifying service projects, acquiring wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that party members play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of rural unemployed party members, through the establishment of the vanguard of unemployed party members, the formation of unemployed party members' work teams, and so on, to guide the majority of grass-roots party members to actively participate in the work of poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letter visit and stability, and forbidden burning, and better integrate the red forces to serve the people.
The building is solid.
Grassroots party organizations are the foundation of the governing building.
Only by adhering to close party group relations and increasing the well-being of the people as a focus point, and leading party building as a fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation, so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out, top up, grass-roots party members' cadres can rush up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance with a "soul", orderly, strong and effective.

Coca-Cola Tibetan Sheep Enter the Return Season - New China Network
Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency Xinhua news agency.
Surveillance footage near the five-way protection station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan lambs led three Tibetan lambs and young boys in a row through the 3002 km of the Qingdao highway and the Qingdao Railway Five-way North Bridge, the Tibetan lamb has begun to retreat.
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan sheep boys in the migratory sheep population accounted for a quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan sheep boys.
Liang Ming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Highlands Biological Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early years of the return, the Tibetan sheep face a higher risk of being slaughtered, so the number of young boys in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no young boys."
According to the statistics of the Zhejiang Zhejiang National Park Administration Director of the Zhejiang Zhejiang Park Coco Cili Administration, the number of Tibetan sheep repatriations has increased year by year, and the number of Tibetan sheep repatriations in 2019 is 4,860, up from 338 in 2018.
The repatriation of Tibetan sheep is expected to end in early September this year, and the number of repatriated Tibetan sheep is expected to continue to increase.
Sheep are protected animals at the national level.
Every year, at the end of May, Tibetan sheep from Qingdao, Shinjuku, Tibetan ponds, and Xinjiang Arkin mountains go to the Lake Chun, which is located in the heart of Cocosili.
Wu Xiaoming, a researcher at the Shaanxi Animal Research Institute (Northwest Endangered Animals Research Institute), said: “Tibet sheep migration is the process of female Tibetan sheep returning to their habitat after giving birth to their offspring. Initially, the return group of offspring is relatively large, but then Tibet sheep will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations, along different paths.”
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan sheep, the reporter learned that the administrative department of the Qingdao National Park Administration, the Qingdao National Park Administration, has arranged personnel in the main relocation areas to carry out video surveillance and patrol in the jurisdiction.
If Tibetan sheep are discovered trying to cross the road, the cruisers will initially carry out temporary traffic controls to ensure that the sheep pass safely through the wildlife passage, ensuring that they are as little as possible interfered by humans on the way back.
How to get rid of the heat in everyday life?
Experts suggest that in the summer, try to avoid the high-temperature period, it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun after noon, because this period of time the sunlight is the strongest, and the likelihood of stroke is higher.
If this time you have to go out, be sure to do protective work, such as wearing an umbrella, wearing a sunshine, wearing sunglasses, and it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sun damage.
Dress as much as possible to choose a light, airborne good cotton, hemp, thread texture, wear less chemical fiber class clothes, so as to avoid a lot of sweat when can not be timely heat, causing heat.
When the weather is hot and hot, prepare enough water to drink, drink in a timely manner, do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once the feeling of thirst indicates that the body is already lacking water, every time drinking water is controlled at 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
Depending on the high and low temperature, the general person drinks 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, and the high temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more can be appropriately supplemented with some salt water to compensate for the salt lost by the body due to sweating.
In addition, in the summer, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency, so that people feel tired and tired, and potassium-containing tea water is an excellent heat drink.
In summer, high-hydration vegetables, such as grapes, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. Fresh fruits, such as peaches, almonds, cucumbers, candy, etc., with a moisture content of 80% to 90%, can be used to supplement the moisture; dairy products can both replenish the water and meet the body's nutritional needs.
In addition, people who work in high-temperature environments should be adequately supplemented with drinks containing magnesium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is strong, consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, both for work and learning, as well as measures to prevent stroke.
Experts say that the best time to go to bed is between 22:00 and 23:00, and the best time to get up is between 5:30 and 6:30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and heat wind.
Experts suggest that people who are doing outdoor activities or high-temperature work, can carry ten drops of water, humidifier, humidifier, humidifier or humidifier, or place in the nearby workplace, to use at any time to prevent stroke.
I hope you take some time to consider the very simple fact that so far most of our understanding of the universe comes from light.
We stand on earth looking at the night sky and can see the stars in the sky with our eyes.
The sunshine is so strong,
We can see the light reflecting from the moon.
Since Galileo pointed his tiny astronomical telescope at the celestial body in the universe, the universe we know today is presented to our eyes through light.
With the help of modern astronomical telescopes, we have been able to collect silent cosmic images – a series of images that can be traced back to the Big Bang.
However, the universe is not a silence, because the universe is not really silent.
I want to tell you that the universe has its own soundtracks, and the universe itself is constantly playing because space can vibrate like drums.
So when something major happens, it can emit a series of sounds to the universe.
Today, we hope to be able to make the sound of this magnificent visual work about the universe.
While we’ve never heard sounds from outer space, we should be able to increase the volume over the next few years to hear what’s happening there.
For this far-reaching goal of capturing the sound of the universe, we have put our focus on black holes and the prospects it shows, because black holes can strike time and space and produce very special sounds like drums strike the drums, and I am also very pleased to give you some of the sounds we predict.
One day in the future we may be able to see a shadow a black hole can leave a shadow on a very bright background, but it has not yet been observed.
Although black holes are not visible, they are likely to be heard, because they hit space like drums.
The idea that the universe can sound like drums came from Albert Einstein, and in fact, many of our ideas came from him.
Einstein realized that if the universe were empty, if it were empty, it would look like this picture, except for the auxiliary lines drawn above.
But if we fall freely into the universe, even without these auxiliary lines, our orbits will draw those lines, because we will find ourselves moving along a straight line, along a straight line that does not curve through the universe.
Einstein also realized – this is the most crucial part (matter also means “matter”) – if you put energy and matter into the universe, the universe will bend.
This is Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
Even the path of light can be curved.
When the bend is large to a certain extent, it revolves around the orbit of the sun, like the earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the earth.
This is the natural curve in the universe.
But Einstein didn’t realize that if you compressed the sun into a ball of six kilometers in diameter – that is to say, you compressed matter equivalent to a million times the mass of the Earth into a ball of six kilometers in diameter – you would create a black hole, which is so dense that light would not be able to escape from it too close – leaving a huge dark shadow in the universe.
But Einstein always thought that black holes were just a mathematical bizarre thing.
He doesn’t believe there really is a black hole.
He believes nature will stop the formation of black holes to protect us.
People only began to use the term “black hole” decades later and realized that black holes were real-life objects – in fact, they were some massive stars at the end of their lives after a catastrophic collapse.
Our Sun will not collapse to form a black hole.
Its quality is not large enough.
But if we did some thought experiments – Einstein liked it so much – we could assume that we compressed the sun into a range of six kilometers after it crushed and then placed a small Earth in its orbit around it, such as placed on an orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole.
The Earth will shine on its own, because now the sun is gone, and we have no other light sources – so our small Earth has to shine on its own.
You’ll find that you can even place the Earth in an orbit 30 kilometers away from the black hole and let it run around it happily.
This black hole is just as big as Manhattan.
Before it destroys the Earth, it could expand to Hudson Street.
But basically this is what we are discussing.
We were talking about an object that was compressed to half the size of Manhattan.
So we moved this Earth to a place close to the black hole – 30 kilometers away – and we noticed it was running around the black hole along a perfect orbit.
There are some rumors that black holes will devour everything in the universe, but in reality you have to be very close to it to really fall into it.
But impressively, from our perspective, we can always see the Earth.
It cannot hide behind a black hole.
Some of the light emitted from Earth falls into a black hole, but some of it is seen by us after being bent by a black hole.
You can’t hide anything behind a black hole.
If this is the story of the space fortress in Caladiga while you’re fighting the Zionists, don’t hide behind a black hole.
They can see you.
Our sun will not collapse into a black hole; it is not massive enough, but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
If one of them were swallowing up the galaxy, it would look like this.
We’ll see a shadow of a black hole thrown onto hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy and the dust bands of the stars.
If we fall into this black hole, we’ll see light reflecting around the black hole, and we don’t even feel at all that some huge change is going on quietly when we start entering that shadow.
If we try to launch the rocket and leave there, the outcome will not be good, because we cannot escape, and even the light cannot escape.
While black holes are dark from the outside, they are not dark from the inside, because light from all galaxies can fall into the black hole with us.
And even so, due to the time expansion effect of the relativity theory, our clock seems to be slower than the time of the galaxy, which looks like the galaxy outside is accelerating changes, just before we ourselves are destroyed by a black hole.
It’s like experiencing the feeling of dying, you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s a complete death experience.
You can’t tell anyone you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Until now, we have never seen the shadows left by such a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they can’t be seen.
Imagine, in a real astronomical scene – imagining two black holes that have existed together for a long time.
Per they were stars before and then collapsed into two black holes – each of which is 10 times the mass of the Sun.
Now we compress them within 60 kilometers.
They can rotate hundreds of times per second.
At the end of life, they approach each other at the speed of light.
Thousands of kilometers can be travelled in a few seconds.In this process, they not only curve space, but also create a vibration of space in the backstream, a real-life space-time wave.
When black holes collide with the universe, space is compressed and stretched.
These vibrations spread at the speed of light in space.
This computer simulation was done by the relativity theory group at the National Aerospace Agency Goddard.
It took 30 years to solve this problem.
This is one of many groups.
It shows two black holes rotating around each other, which are imagined curves.
As you can see—maybe somewhat vague—you can see the red waves being launched, which are gravitational waves.
They are the sounds of a real universe that will spread out from these black holes at the speed of light as black holes merge together until the two black holes merge into one quietly rotating black hole.
If you stand close enough, your ears will resonate with the compression and stretching of these spaces.
You can really hear those voices.
Of course, you will helplessly find that your head is also compressed and stretched, so you may not be able to understand exactly what happened.
But I would like to broadcast for you the voice We have predicted.
This is the findings of my group’s research – a relatively concise computational model.
Imagine a smaller mass black hole falling into a larger mass black hole.
The sound you hear comes from a small mass black hole that collides with space in the process of approaching a massive black hole.
If they are far away, the sound will be very small.
But the gradual sound became like a drummer tapping the space, letting the space vibrate like a drummer.
We can predict what that sound will be like.
We know that in the process of falling, small mass black holes are getting faster and faster, and the sounds are getting louder.
Eventually, we will hear the little black hole completely fall into the big black hole.
I never thought the sound was so loud—here it was actually amplified.
When I listened to it at home, I felt that the voice didn’t help.
It sounds like, bite, bite, bite.
This is another voice in the simulation of our research team.
I will not show you the images here, because black holes will not leave any useful traces, and real space will not show you those virtual curves.
But if you hear this sound when you’re on vacation in the universe, I suggest you run quickly.
It’s best to get away from that sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Two black holes are approaching each other.
In this case, they all shake sharply.
Then they will merge together.
That sharp sound is a sign of black hole fusion – a sharp sound that comes out when the fusion ends.
This is the prediction we make of what we will see.
Luckily, we were very safe in California’s Long Beach.
There is no doubt that two black holes have merged together somewhere in the universe.
Equally undoubtedly, the space around us can also feel these vibrations that travel through a million light-years, or from a million years ago, they spread at the speed of light and eventually meet us.
But these voices are so small that we can’t hear them at all.
Some experiments in the world require a lot of heart blood to build up – including one called LIGO – which will detect spatial vibrations at a distance of less than one atomic nucleus per four kilometers.
This is a very bold attempt, and its sensitivity will not be exceeded in the coming years – it will be used to detect spatial vibrations.
Another research project on the universe is expected to start over the next decade, called LISA.
LISA will be able to see supermassive black holes — black holes that are millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun.
In the images taken by the Hubble Telescope, we can see the two galaxies.
They looked like they were stagnantly hugging together.
Their center may exist separately a massive super black hole.
But they are not stationary, they are actually integrating.
The two black holes will collide, and their merger will take billions of years.
Therefore, the collection of the sounds they emit has gone beyond our human perception.
But LISA can see the final phase of two supermassive black holes that began to merge long before, namely, the 15 minutes before they merged.
This detection is not limited to black holes only, it can also be used to detect any major disturbance in the universe – the largest of which is the Big Bang.
When the word was created, some people mocked, “Oh, who would believe the Big Bang of the Universe?”
This animated short film made by a friend of mine at Proton Studios shows the scenes of watching the Big Bang from the outside.
We never really want to be like this; we want to be inside the universe, because there is no such thing as being outside the universe.
So, imagine you are in the midst of a big explosion.
The universe is everywhere, everything in the world is around you, and the space is shaking disorderly.
Fourteen billion years have passed, and this voice is still around us.
The galaxies gradually form, and a group of stars form in the galaxy. On a planet, there is at least one such planet, suitable for life.
Here we crazyly build experiments, do calculations, and write computer code.
A billion years ago, two black holes collided.
This sound has always been traveling through time and space.
We didn’t even appear here.
It’s getting closer – 40,000 years ago, we were still painting on the stone walls of the caves.
If the sound we want to get was the Big Bang, it would sound like this.
Strictly speaking, it is noise.
It was a white noise, a chaotic bell.
But it is everywhere around us, as long as it is not offset by some other processes in the universe.
If we were able to detect these sounds, it would be like music to our ears, for this silent echo comes from the moment we were created, from the universe we look forward to.
So in the years to come, we will be able to increase the volume of these songs a little, so that the universe is presented to us in the form of audio.
But if we were able to detect those earliest moments, it would also take us further from understanding the Big Bang, enabling us to question some of the most difficult and at the same time most volatile questions.
If we play the course of the universe, we can know that there has been a Big Bang in the past, we can even hear its noisy sound, but is our Big Bang the only Big Bang in the universe?
I mean, we can’t help but ask, has there been a similar big explosion before?
Will it happen again in the future?
I think if we raise the meaning of the question to the level that TED advocates to trigger people to rethink, at least in this last minute, we can ask some questions that we may never answer.
But we can’t help but ask: Is our universe just an intrigue of a much larger history?
Or are we just a branch of the multiverse—each of which has experienced its own Big Bang—maybe some of them are bubbling black holes, maybe some are not—maybe some are conscious life, maybe some are not—they don’t belong to our past, nor do they exist in our future, but are connected to us in some way?
So we can’t help but guess if there is a multi-universe, if there is life in the other branches of this multi-universe.
This is life in our multi-universe.
Is there any other life in the multiverse that is also speculating about our existence, thinking about their own origin?
If so, I can imagine them doing calculations like us, writing computer code, building experimental instruments, trying to detect those weak sounds that came from their origins, and wondering who else was there.
Thanks to everyone.
and applause
Graduate art exhibition moves to shopping mall public welfare exhibition - China Network
During the season of "cloud graduation" at major colleges, a difficult offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly this weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor in the campus, but appears in the public space of the city, and is open to the public for free, and will last until August 23.
Reporters learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition, gathered 50 pieces / group of works of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, the exhibition space extended from 2 floors to 6 floors, and fully utilized the interior light boxes for the display of graphic works, to the maximum extend the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is special.
Mr. Gengping, head of the exhibition, said: "We chose to take the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud' to bring back the space, and also hope that more people will see the youth's exploration and understanding of the world, and enhance the healing power of art for society and the soul."
She revealed that the works of the exhibition were gathered to the graduates of several major arts colleges, and selected for the display suitable for commercial space, the form of the work from the traditional shelf painting, sculpture, to new media devices, interactive animation, VR panorama, volume and richness of the most of the years.
Among them, Li Yongshou in the "First Campaign of 2020" through the mechanical and manual blend of creative language, expressed his feelings in this epidemic; Liu Yongshou through the Ethereum blockchain creation of the work "Sound Money" explored "cryptocurrency", "credit creation", "trade" and other themes; Zhang Yonghua's "Cat Forest" and Qingda Jing's "Hang" are often accompanied by human beings, from which you can see the understanding of young artists about human and animal relationships; and Zhu Yonghua's work "Winter of Faith - gifts" is to remind young people in growth, "When a day the career has matured, do not forget the first heart, remember that simple and sincere."
Among the few graduates who personally exhibited, there are Li Qing Yi from the sculpture department of the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
“I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, which was displayed with alcohol cotton and testing reports.”
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" structure is more complex and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his students repair damaged works.
“Build up until four o’clock in the morning, then do repairs, the time is tight, all forgot to match the work, there is also a little regret.”
He hopes, as soon as the epidemic is more stable, to come to Beijing with his classmates to see his work exhibition.
The journalist Lee.
That morning, 65-year-old Bosonaro posted a photo on Twitter, in which he was wearing sports shoes, without a mask, sitting in front of a table with breakfast, with a smile on his face, one hand lifting his thumb and the other hand lifting a box of chlorine drug.
He tweeted, “Good morning, new coronavirus test results: negative.”
However, Bosonaro did not specify when the new coronavirus test was carried out.
On July 5, Bosonaro showed symptoms of new coronary pneumonia, on the 6th receiving the virus test results were positive, on the 7th he announced via live television that he confirmed his diagnosis of new coronary pneumonia.
On the 14th and 21st, Bosonaro tested for the new coronavirus twice, and the results remained positive.
During the isolation, Bosonaro repeatedly demonstrated his use of chlorophyllipt drugs via social media live, and said that chlorophyllipt was good for new coronavirus and felt good after taking it, and his good physical condition was due to chlorophyllipt, arguing that Brazilian medical institutions used chlorophyllipt drugs to treat new coronavirus.
According to Brazilian media reports, as of now, five other cabinet ministers and 10 governors in Brazil have been confirmed to have been infected with coronavirus.

Fans of the event included Qingdao mobile staff and doctors, teachers, public security personnel and others who made outstanding contributions to society during the epidemic, July 31, this season CBA season officially opened, when will also be officially resumed for fans ticket sales.
Influenced by the epidemic, the CBA league resumed on June 20 after an interruption of five months.
Although there were few spectators at the entrance to the game on the 26th afternoon, the feeling of the camp was already clear: someone was applauding and someone was silent.
Players on the pitch are striking relative, fans on the pitch are also protesting in the court, such a picture has not been seen for a long time.
During the after-season game, fans should pay attention to these if they want to watch the scene.
The venue for the opening of the fans ticket purchase competition is Qingdao National Trust Sports Center Diamond Stadium (Qingdao area), the online real-name ticket purchase and online real-name entrance system is fully implemented, all fans must be 12 years of age and have a 48-hour endocrine acid testing certificate.
A reward of 50,000 Yuan Hubei Ensch praised the sand dam slide "early warning first person" - China
On July 26, the City of Enschede announced that he praised Chen Lighting, a geological disaster spot monitor who made an important contribution to the early warning of the sand dam slope, and sent a bonus of 50,000 yuan for him.
At the same time, the party member cadres are called to learn to abide by the spirit of duty, dare to take responsibility, take initiative, and be willing to devote.
On July 21, a slump occurred in the sand dam of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village of the village, leading to the formation of the dry stream of the river, the 58-year-old Chen Lighting was the first person to warn of the slump.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen learned of the news of the walls in the villagers' homes, and immediately went to the scene to check out.
He had just walked out of the house for five hundred and six hundred meters, and saw the village road split four and five centimeters apart, stretching along the road to the cornfield, about fifty meters long.
Chen Lightnington was alert, the first time to send photos of the road rupture to the local "geological disaster monitor contact group".
After examining and judging the relevant person in charge of the plant at the site, the possibility of a slope is great, and then the decision to evacuate the masses is made.

In the face of praise, he said, “There is no one to save, it is my responsibility.”
Australian University to develop new drug to treat new coronary-induced blood vessel blockage
Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope it can be used to treat vascular blockage caused by the new coronavirus.
The researchers found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in a platelet accelerates platelet coagulation.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage, and prevent heart disease and stroke.
The researchers say the drug only suppresses the coagulation effect of platelets when signs of heart disease or stroke appear.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockages are one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe coronary disease, researchers hope the drug can be used in the future for the treatment of patients with this type of severe disease.
Currently, the drug has shown good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of clinical trials in humans.
The results of the study have recently been published in the American journal Science and Transitional Medicine.
He became the first audience to enter the CBA League reboot after allowing audiences to watch live.

Xinhua Hami, Xinjiang, July 26th: Xinjiang cultivates "Hi-Hi-Hi fields" with clean energy
More than 6000 five-sided shaped sunglasses, each 48 square meters, a circle and a circle are arranged in order, such as a silver "solstice field", with the sun turning, reflect the sunlight to the center more than 200 meters high heat absorption tower, to power generation.
Reporters saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami Salt Tower photothermal power plant of the Chinese power plant in Igo County Zhongmao Lake Town, Xinjiang.
"The so-called melted salt tower photothermal power generation, is to reflect the sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form thermal energy, and then through traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of Zhejiang Solar Heat Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the rural use of solar stoves in the northwestern region of China, all the sunlight is gathered.
The plant began construction in October 2017, and at the end of last year it was achieved, occupying 6,600 acres of land, with a total of 14,500 scheduled to be installed.
“The biggest advantage compared to traditional solar power generation technology is that it can store accumulated heat and generate electricity at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project can allow the power generation unit to maintain continuous and stable operation, without the influence of lighting changes; it can also be rapidly involved in the power grid peak according to the demand of the grid load valley.
After the project is fully completed, it can an annual power generation of 1.98 billion degrees Celsius, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of smoke, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing local sources of constant clean energy.
In addition to this, there is another silver-colored "Hai Hui field" in the stone-city photovoltaic industrial park in Hammi.
Humphrey's photovoltaic solar power plant occupies more than 2,300 acres, and the built 714 power generation equipment also follows the sun's rotation, always keeping sunlight and photovoltaic panels in a 90-degree rectangle.
"We use double-axis tracking photovoltaic power generation technology, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust angles according to the sun's height, to maintain power generation efficiency."
The head of the power plant, Pao Monchi, said that in light weather conditions, the photovoltaic power generation efficiency of the power generation technology can be increased by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power plant has generated more than 7 million degrees Celsius, supplementing local electricity demand.
The photovoltaic industrial park is currently the largest and most complete photovoltaic industry demonstration park in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, total installation of 820,000 kilowatts.
The completion of power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 100 million degrees, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2019.
Hammi is one of the best solar resource conditions in China.
The average annual total amount of solar radiation is more than 6,200 megawatts per square meter, and the number of sunlight hours throughout the year is about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry, cultivating the "August field".
The solar power generation scale of more than 250 million kilowatts has been installed, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14%.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic power plants, and the installed capacity exceeds 10 million kilowatts.
PV generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police notified of the details of "missing female university students to travel to Qinghai" search and rescue work continues - Xinhua Network
Xinhua news agency Xinjiang, July 26 (reporter Wang Kim 周) recently caused the attention of netizens about the "disconnection of a female university student after traveling to Qinghai-Gormu".
The Ministry of Public Security of the Tibetan Autonomous Province of Haitian Mongolian Province of Qinghai said on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a disconnected state, and the police are deepening along the line of Huang Mou disconnected area, and actively carry out the search for work.
On July 10, 2020, the public security department of the Public Security Bureau of the city of Guelmu, Haiti, received a higher level notification that Huang Mou, a student of a certain university in Nanjing, on July 5 took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Guelmu, and on July 9 in Qinghai province, Qinghai province, Qinghai province, Qinghai province, Qinghai province, Xinjiang province, Sonan Daiji protection station in the southwestern area of Qinghai River, the phone was shut down and disconnected, requesting help to find.

The US media revealed the truth about the US unjustified demand of China to close its consulate in Houston.

US media revealed the truth about the US unjustified demand for China to close its consulate in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to withdraw the establishment and operation license for the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the General Consulate to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden demand of the Chinese side to close the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the U.S. government has caused multiple concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did China close its consulate?
Several foreign media outlets said it was not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese consulate in Houston, but about the purpose of this move, the foreign media clearly said: for the general election.
U.S. cable television news network (CNN) on the 23rd that the move by the U.S. to demand the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
The U.S. government’s catastrophic response to the new coronavirus has caused President Trump’s popular support rate to be relatively low before the election.
White House officials privately said the tough strategy taken against China was to save Trump’s support rate and also to shift the responsibility for the failure of the White House’s response to the epidemic.
The article argued that the Chinese consulate in Houston was a “politically driven, very cautious” target chosen by the United States, and the U.S. government chose it “to build a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict.”
The BBC also believes that at a time when the U.S. election season is coming and the U.S. economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing 'Chinese cards' has a political advantage."
The current situation is a “spiritual upward, sharp-related struggle,” which is, to a certain extent, driven by the U.S. government from the perspective of domestic considerations, which will only worsen tensions between China and the United States.
Columbia broadcaster CBS that Trump's prospects for re-election were pressured by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Nearly every day there are new actions in the United States against Trump’s absurd argument that “China is exploiting America.”
“The Houston General Consulate is very important in building ties between the two countries.”
The United States’ demand for China’s closure of its consulate in Houston has escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
The closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, in addition to diplomatic implications, has made it difficult for Chinese citizens in the South of the United States to access consular services, and for U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regretted the U.S. demand that China shut down its consulate in Houston, saying the consulate played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The AP believes that this reflects the importance of China’s economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine said the move was “part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen U.S.-China relations.”
Jonathan Polak, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institute, said that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1979, he could not imagine any move to compare with the U.S. action against the Chinese consulate in Houston.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post that this move by the United States is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe that this move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese consulate in the United States.
China currently has one embassy and five consulates in the United States.

Afterwards, he arrived in the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg on a speedboat and landed to watch the parade held on the Neva River.
Speaking at the parade, Putin said that the level of modern technology in the Russian Navy's equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique hypersonic strike system in 2020.
In addition, Navy Commander-in-Chief Yevgeny Menov said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry agency newspaper "Red Star", the Russian shipbuilding plan has been effectively implemented, and the number of new vessels planned to be received by the Russian Navy in 2020 has been larger in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great began to form a naval fleet, opening up the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July is Russian Navy Day.
In response to new changes in the prevention and control of epidemics, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region to actively participate in the prevention and control of epidemics.
Tianjin northern trade union cadres, workers, model labour entered the street communities, and the masses of residents, carry out activities such as food delivery, disinfection and sterilization, and dissemination of knowledge on vaccine prevention, serving the workers' masses, and showing the "hard nuclear power" of the trade union with practical actions.
Recently, the Sympathy Group of the General Trade Union of the Tiananmen District of Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control livelihoods to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak, the Tianjin district invested more than $1.5 million in funding for the first time, and urgently allocated it to 23 directly related grassroots unions.
Zhao Fei, deputy secretary of the Party Committee for Construction and Construction of China's Xinjiang Construction and Construction, and chairman of the trade union, after receiving the company's notification on the prevention and control of the epidemic, initially requested him to choose to remain in the unit's duty and escort the employees.
He sent cooking tools, food and daily supplies to employees who lived in unit dormitories and new employees, and organized people to send them life-needed supplies every two days.
"From July 21st, the cadres and employees who adhere to the line of war 'pest' will be taken to the bottom, and they will take the way of ordering online and delivering goods to the door of the merchants, and will first act on the 704 first-line workers in the Urumqi region to supplement the purchase of vaccine supplies and livelihoods."
The head of the Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of an emergency epidemic, they make every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere of fighting the "pest".
At present, it is in the heat of the summer, trade unions at all levels pay close attention to the first line of workers in the key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and put the care of "sending cool" into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi Prefecture General Trade Union launched a complaint campaign to the first line of epidemic prevention and control workers, and the police station, card points and health systems across the county received drinks, fruits and other complaints.
Trade union cadres should further raise their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, and inspire the struggle with care and warm people's hearts.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations to consolidate employees and unite employees, ensure epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health and interests of the majority of employees, and send care to the first-line employees."
The relevant person in charge of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region said.
2020 Direct Recruitment Officers Work Completely Launched - New China Network
On July 26, the Ministry of Political Work of the Military Commission and the Ministry of National Defense Mobilization of the Military Commission jointly issued a notice to deploy the direct recruitment of officers from ordinary high school graduates in 2020.
This year, direct recruitment officers cover 64 types of machines, automation, machinery and more than 270 military general specialties, with the focus on increasing the recruitment of drones, navigation, aerospace, electronic information, small languages and other professional efforts, and the recruitment scale increased by 2,000 people compared to last year.
This year, the direct recruitment of officers and the recruitment of compulsory soldiers will be synchronized with the implementation of the organization, which will begin on August 1 and end on September 30.
Young candidates can inquire through the national recruitment network (web address: http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn) about the conditions for direct recruitment of officers and the distribution of professional recruitment, submit online registration information that meets the professional scope and recruitment conditions, and participate in subsequent recruitment work such as physical examination, political assessment and other subsequent recruitment according to the uniform requirements of the military service organ.
Qualified youths who have failed to be recruited as officers because of the restrictions on the recruitment of professions and programmes may participate in compulsory military recruitment and, when the period of compulsory military service is expired, be selected as officers, the number of years enrolled in ordinary higher schools according to the prescribed scheme shall be regarded as the duration of service.
This year's officer recruitment work is unifiedly organized by the provincial or local-level people's government recruitment offices, and potential-rich professions will be selected on the basis of comprehensive measurement of the academic level of the subject of enrollment, professional course achievements during the school, professional qualification certificate, etc. The scarcity of professions will be targeted at local universities that meet professional requirements and have recruitment advantages.
In accordance with the normalized prevention and control requirements of the outbreak, this year's direct service officers will in principle not arrange to report on their own, and will organize transportation into the camp in sync with the compulsory soldiers.
Direct recruitment of officers to the army starts on September 1, 2020, and the date for the military to issue orders for officers to serve is December 1, 2020.
The reception unit of the troops will scientifically formulate the entry and professional training program, carefully organize the training; after the training is completed, the recruiting officers will be unified and accurately allocated to the counter professional technical positions in accordance with the principle of professional matching and recruitment.
Embassy spokesman: The Chinese government is a firm defender of cyber security
According to the Chinese Embassy in the UK website, on July 25, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the UK asked reporters about the mistake of the cyber attack.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a firm defender of cybersecurity and has consistently resolutely opposed and combated all forms of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
According to the media, a Chinese-related hacking group has interfered with a British company's network system, launched attacks on British-American technology companies with patented data, and entered the EU government networks.
The Chinese government is a firm defender of cybersecurity and has consistently resolutely opposed and combated all forms of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace virtuality is strong, traceability is difficult, behavior is diverse, and sufficient evidence should be drawn when investigating and qualitative network events, and cannot be inferred without reason.
A series of previous incidents, such as the Prism Gate, proved that the United States has been carrying out the world’s largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining cyberspace peace and stability is in the common interest of all nations.
China’s achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not stolen or stolen, but gained through self-sufficiency and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 590,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, becoming the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become an innovation and intellectual property powerhouse.
Data from the Urumqi branch of the People's Bank of China showed that in the first half of the year, new loans to agriculture and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the overall annual growth in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the people's bank's Urumqi central branch used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to increase its lending efforts and provide adequate financial guarantees for epidemic prevention and rebuilding.
The majority of Urumqi free nucleic acid testing areas have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas.
On July 26, Zhang Zhang, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, told Urumqi City of the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing, that at present, the free nucleic acid testing work in Urumqi City has basically been completed in most areas.
The expert group of the State Council and experts of the Autonomous Region and Urumqi City are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The news office of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region held a press conference on June 26 to inform the situation of the outbreak and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0 a.m. to 24 a.m. on July 25th, 22 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Urumqi city (of which 5 were confirmed cases of non-symptomatic infections) and 38 were confirmed cases of non-symptomatic infections.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases in Urumqi city and 147 cases of non-symptomatic infection.
The newly added non-symptomatic infections were also basically tested and actively screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
Zhang, the head of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th that the majority of Urumqi city free nucleic acid testing work has basically been completed.
He also said that from the experience of other regions of the country, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid testing results, such as the sensitivity of the test agent, the time of infection and detoxification of the test personnel, the cooperation of the testers when collecting samples (coordinating differences may cause the sample not to be taken) and the testing environment, the operation skill of the testers, etc.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing also shows a false negative result.
The so-called false negative means that the detected person is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, for people who have been in close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, it is usually necessary to do two tests of nucleic acid to rule out.
For people who have been to the high-risk areas of the outbreak, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, the presence of a false negative nucleic acid test may be negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to exclude.
He said that given the above circumstances, in order to ensure the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, the city of Urumqi will conduct a second free test of nucleic acid in key areas such as Tianjin district and Shaybak district, while conducting a "examination of residual leaks".
It is that the Tiananmen district and Shijiazhuang district are high-risk areas for the outbreak.

White House epidemic expert: cautiously optimistic about vaccine development in early 2021
Foucault said this at a video conference hosted by the International Leaders Foundation.
He reminded that it’s not clear how the epidemic will develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the outbreak’s ultimate impact will be, “and the only way to end it all is that we all choose to be part of the solution.”
According to the data of the Johns Hopkins University of the United States, as of the 25th, 21st, the confirmed cases of new corona in the United States have reached 417,6 thousand and died 14.6 thousand.
Fuchs said that some parts of the United States are currently struggling to deal with the recurring epidemic.
Although outbreaks vary from place to place and need to be addressed locally, a diversified counter-epidemic strategy does not mean there are no close links between regions.
The outbreak in one region ultimately affects other regions.
“Now is not the time for self-satisfaction,” Fuchs said, “our work is not done, we must intensify our efforts and be alert to the uncertainty of the future.”
American Chinese medical experts, the founder of the "cocktail therapy" for treating HIV, noted at the meeting that the new coronavirus epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
“We all need to do our part to slow down the spread of this virus.”
He called on the public to use their practical actions to gain time for scientists to accelerate the development of new coronary therapy drugs and vaccines.
The International Leaders Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchanges in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region and is committed to promoting the status of the United States as an Asian-Pacific nation and fostering international youth leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Transport Minister Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Federal Representative Meng Shouwen and International Leaders Foundation Founding Chairman Yan Yue Liang spoke at the meeting respectively.
They paid a special tribute to Asia-Pacific health workers and volunteers on the front line and called on the U.S. public to continue to adhere to vaccination guidelines such as “social distance” to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that magnesium chloride is ineffective in treating mild coronary pneumonia
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that chlorine is ineffective in patients with mild coronary pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups, conducting clinical trials, mainly comparing the therapeutic effects of using chlorophyllipt alone or in combination with other antibiotics, and analyzing whether it helps improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate coronary pneumonia.
The results showed that magnesium chloride not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on the organs.
The study was conducted by several prestigious hospitals in Brazil, such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Heart Hospital (HCor), Hospital Sírio-Libanês, in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Clinical Research (BCRI) and the Brazilian Research Network for Serious Surveillance (BRICNet).
On the 25th, Brazil’s President Bolsonaro announced on his social media platform that his fourth nucleic acid test was negative.
During the time of the infection, Bosonaro continued to take potassium chloride and actively propagated it several times.

U.S.-China trade talks representatives to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous informed source as saying that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiating team, Deputy Prime Minister of the State Council, and the joint leader of the U.S. team, and trade representative, Liu He, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between the two sides.
While China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, China’s purchases are still a distance from the quantity promised in the trade agreement due to factors such as the new coronavirus outbreak.
Analysts say the recent US-China closure of each other’s consulates, coupled with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the China-US trade agreement comes into effect a month after it was signed on January 15, and the agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework panel of the two sides should meet once every six months.
Information sources said the meeting would be “an important turning point” for both sides to evaluate the progress of the agreement.
But the source also said that if the U.S.-China tensions resulted in a lack of willingness to meet at this time, the two sides may agree that the telephone meeting with Liu He on May 8 has met the terms of talks every six months in the trade agreement.
Since this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, and disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
U.S. President Donald Trump has boasted of his achievements in the first phase of the agreement earlier this year, but his attitude has recently changed.
He said at a press conference in the White House that while China recently purchased record amounts of U.S. corn on a single day, it also bought a lot of soybeans, “this trade deal is now less meaningful to me than it was when it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place due to poor U.S.-China relations, "trade issues in the U.S.-China relationship have lost weight."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we've done our best to buy, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Penning, vice chairman of the US-China National Trade Commission, said thatining the first phase of the agreement is "more important than ever before" and said China has made progress this year in further opening up its financial markets to U.S. companies.
Analysts at independent research firm Plenum said: “It’s better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be considered routine.”

Economic Observation Network reporter Zhang Bin Due to the Lucky Coffee Fake Incident, the U.S. market has implemented more stringent supervision on China's stock exchange, coupled with the long-term valuation pressure, the stock exchange in the U.S. is listed under pressure, and China's stock exchange has recently opened its way back to Hong Kong.
In recent years, companies such as Shell and Ideal Cars have increased their enthusiasm to go to the United States.
Under the epidemic and the stock market crisis, is now the best time for Chinese companies to go to the U.S. listings?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and the company's next to go to the U.S. listing, the U.S. IPO is essentially not affected, but the market is very good now, even now this time is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the U.S. IPO in the last 10 years."
The Chief Representative of the China Region of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, Hu Zhang, said at the 2020 Summit of the Leader of Listed Companies, hosted by Snowball.
In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Companies Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a statement on the quality of auditing and the important role of regulatory access to auditing and other international information — discussing the current challenges of information acquisition for U.S. listed companies with significant operations in China.
The statement said that despite a significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, problems with U.S. regulatory access to information remain, and that the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in line with the document, the PCAOB website provides a detailed list of listed companies and their audit agencies that have encountered auditing difficulties, with a large number of listed companies.
In addition, in May, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies listed in the U.S.
According to Ho Chi Minh, the stock market crisis did not affect the appetite of investors.
“This news just came out, caused everyone to panic, everyone was asking if the future could still go to the U.S. listed, but later we found that these issues are not the case on the side of investors, investors may ask these questions when they recently went to the U.S. IPO, and even become a standardized issue, but this is not considered by investors as an important factor in not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that we look at the current situation as normally as possible.
Of course, this surface may seem to be the worst in the past two years, but it hasn’t been affected in terms of investor appetite.
So from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. election, the tide of the IPO will continue.”
On May 9, this year, Kim Jong-un was officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the U.S. IPO after the outbreak.
“The listing of Kim Jong-un has given a great deal of confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for the IPO.”
He said.
Snowball released in the first half of 2020 summary stock data report showed that in the first half of this year, the US IPO Chinese enterprises totaled 20 companies, up 17.6% compared to the same period last year; from the initial fundraising total, 20 enterprises total fundraising of 27.25 billion, compared to the same period last year, has recovered, increasing more than 52.4%; in the industry distribution, the number of IPO in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year is outstanding, compared with the same period last year, 100%.
In the first half of this year, Chinese companies to go to the U.S. IPO have a higher quality, have a hard basic and growing high-quality company, will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hu Xi Jinping continued to be optimistic about the Chinese company's IPO to the United States.
"In the short term, the tide of the US IPO is still ongoing; in the middle term, Chinese companies have more options, A-shares, Hong Kong shares, U.S. shares, we will take the U.S. general election and Sino-U.S. relations as the market choice and time choice consideration factor; in the long run, everything will return to normal, market volatility is cyclical, both political cycle, and economic cycle, will eventually return to the normal stage, the stock market has always been fluctuating forward."
He said at the same time, "This year there are more uncertainties, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, and investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

People's Daily commentator: focus on doing their own business to create new advantages for future development — — important speech of General Secretary Xi Jinping on learning to implement in the Entrepreneurs' Symposium.
Xinhua news agency Beijing, July 25  People's Daily July 26 commentary article: focus on doing their own business to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic orientation, enhancing confidence and concentrating on doing our own business is the key to addressing various risks.
At the entrepreneur symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current rise of protectionism, the world economy is downward and the global market is shrinking in the external environment, we must concentrate our efforts to do our own business, give full play to the domestic super-large-scale market advantages, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic big cycle as the main body, domestic international double cycle mutually promoting, upgrade the modernization level of the industrial supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology investigation, and build new advantages for future development.
The winner is the winner, the winner is the winner.
In the external environment of deep development of economic globalization, markets and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the epidemic shock is undergoing profound changes, facing more uncertainty and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing reversal and reversal waves.
To do well for a long time to respond to the changes in the external environment, the mental preparation and work preparation, to promote China's economy to catch the wind and stability, a very important aspect is to expand and meet domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, give full play to its advantages, through the prosperity of the domestic economy, free domestic cycle for China's economic development to add momentum, and drive the world economic recovery.
We must deeply recognize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to our country's long-term development and long-term stability.
It is necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, it is necessary to respond to the shock of the epidemic, it is necessary to maintain the sustainable and healthy development of China's economy in the long term, and it is also necessary to meet the people's ever-growing need for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is internal circularity.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, improved supporting capabilities, with more than 100 million market participants and more than 1,7 million people with higher education or various professional skills, and the super large-scale domestic demand market, including more than 400 million middle-income groups of 1.4 billion people, is in the new type of industrialization, informationization, urbanization, agriculture modernization rapid development stage, investment demand potential is huge.
Public ownership as the main entity, the common development of a variety of ownership economies, the distribution of labor as the main entity, the coexistence of a variety of distribution methods, the basic socialist economic system such as the socialist market economy system, can both stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote efficiency and fairness and organic unification, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis for expanding domestic demand, so that all aspects of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to a good cycle, clear the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance of total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main, domestic international double cycle mutually promoting.
Openness brings progress, and closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that the door to China's opening up will not be closed, but will only open and grow.
With the domestic cycle as the main focus, it is not to close the doors to close the operation, but to make the domestic market and the international market better connected by leveraging the potential of domestic demand, better utilize the two domestic and international markets, two resources, and stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding opening up are not contradictory, the smoother the domestic cycle, the more favorable it is to build a new pattern of opening up, the more favorable it is to form new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionist thinking is rising internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reforms, expanding opening up, strengthening cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the building of a community of human destiny.
In the history of the Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations, but it has never been overwhelmed, but is becoming more and more frustrated and courageous, constantly growing in tribulation and struggling from tribulation.
On the way forward, there is a strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, there are remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, there is a strong mobilization capability and strong comprehensive strength, there is the unity struggle of the whole party army and people of all ethnic groups across the country, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of China's economic and social development, comprehensively build a prosperous society, and smoothly start the new journey of comprehensively building a socialist modern country!
Balance income downward “after 90” instead of “retaliatory” savings?
With the return on balance sheet going down, “90s” not only did not escape the balance sheet, but instead started “retaliatory” saving money?
China's New Economic Research Institute jointly released the "Saving Money Report" (2020 edition) showed that in the first half of the year, "90s" preferred to save money: per capita savings increased by 40 percent than in 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" is more inclined to start saving from a "small money", with 60 percent averaging less than 20 yuan per savings.
Saving money with the balance sheet has also become the "after 90" savings habit.
The data show that of the 700 million remaining Treasury users, 1.34 billion users are "after 90".
China has 17.4 billion after 90s, that is, about three out of every four after 90s in the country are saving money with the balance.
Currently, the annual yield rate of 7 days for monetary funds such as balance sheet treasures has been higher than 2% at the beginning of the year and has fallen to about 1.5%.
Even so, it does not affect the pace of saving money after 90.
And in the context of the "money-saving effect" of the balance sheet, many young people who are accustomed to using the balance sheet are also directly transformed into "city citizens".
Paypal data showed that as of July 13, the new "people" on paypal in the last month grew more than twice the same rate, and more and more young people realized the "progress" in paypal finance.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance sheet into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the monetary fund in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls are more inclined to save more money, averaging two per cent more than boys; among users who hold funds on paypal platforms, 6 per cent are men, and women and men tend to choose a more stable way of funding.
What are the plans after “90”?
Paypal data shows that "after 90" has the habit of aiming to save money, taking travel as the most money-saving goal of users.
Influenced by the outbreak, many “after 90” saved money to prepare for the aftermath of the outbreak; the movie theaters resumed their operations and also offered new ways to shift from saving to consumption.

France Increases Military Investment in Space - China Network
French Defense Minister Florence Parry said on Monday that France would add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget to develop a space military force to prevent “unfriendly actions” by other countries in outer space.
Parry told The Provence that the French military spending budget for space projects between 2019 and 2025 will increase from the previously planned €3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to €4.3 billion ($5 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, which was approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic interceptor satellites and raise the level of modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that the French Air Force will establish a space military command and an "Air and Space Force".
Parry said she would officially announce the creation of the space force when she later visited a military school in Salon, Provence.
Parry said the space force belongs to the Air Force and will be equipped to 500 people by 2025.
She said: “The idea that space was thought to serve the common interests of science has never returned, and now space is the place where nations are fighting for global hegemony.”
Parry reiterated Macron's previous statements, saying France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are not at all in an arms race, but it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threats we may face.”
Parry reiterated the 2017 surveillance of a French-Italian military satellite.
She said the spy was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Parry said France would "within a short time" have a small patrol satellite capable of spotting and locking "the men behind the unfriendly moves."
French media believe that France sought to establish a space force because U.S. President Donald Trump last February asked the U.S. Department of Defense to draft a law on the creation of a space force.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the sixth-largest U.S. military, the Space Force.
Some experts fear that the U.S. move will accelerate the pace of U.S. space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

It is the construction site of the Three Canyon Tunnel.
The Central Railway Company.
On July 26, a reporter from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. was informed that the total length of about 18.9 kilometers of Chengdu High-speed Railway Three Canyon Tunnel was fully operated.
It is understood that the Three Canyon Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the scope of the Three Canyon District, but also among the projects currently under construction in the country, the design of the longest single hole double-line high-speed rail tunnel at a speed of 350 km / h.
Zhengzhou high-speed rail is located within the municipalities of Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing three provinces, in the north of Zhengzhou to Beijing, Xi'an and Xu Lan high-speed rail, in the south of Zhengzhou to Chongqing high-speed rail arrives in Chongqing, is an important component of China's "eight-coloured" high-speed railway network along the river channel and Chongqing channel.
The Chongqing High-speed Railway Three Canyon Tunnel was opened on the 26th.
The picture goes through the scene.
Zhengzhou high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, southwest through Pyeongchang Mountain City, Nanjing City, Zhengzhou City, Hubei Province to Chongqing City, the entire length of the new line is about 818 kilometers, the design speed is 350 kilometers per hour, and Chongqing territory is about 184 kilometers.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Zhejiang section has been opened early on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is accelerating the construction.
The small three-strait tunnel is a full-line control project for Zhengzhou high-speed rail, the project is located at the border between Chongqing City of Zhengzhou and Wuchang County, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, and a maximum depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to the design of the China Railway Second House Engineering Group limited liability company Zheng Wei High-speed Railway Tunnel Design Head of the King's Army, the geological conditions of the location of the Three Canyon Tunnel are very complex, facing the risks of rock melting, melting water, large deformation of soft rock, high-risk tunnels, and the tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
“During the construction of the project, we used geological investigation methods, exploration methods and advanced drilling methods, and adopted special designs for more than 30 types of hole. such as the design of a 24-meter bridge, a large hole across the tunnel with a vertical length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters, to avoid the tunnel sinking,” said the Royal Army.
According to the construction side, the construction of the tunnel, taking the evacuation block combination method, through the construction of cross-hole parallel guidance, water injection blockage, strengthen the tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment station, both to ensure the orderly advancement of the project, but also to avoid the construction of drainage to the destruction of the water of the scenic area, while successfully overcome the construction of 7 kilometers of large deformation of soft rock such as poor geology, the daily maximum flow of water to 15.7 thousand cubic meters of multicolor flow of water.
After the completion of the construction of the entire high-speed railway line, it will become a new convenient and fast main passenger transportation channel in the southwestern region to the Central Range, northern China and northeast China, which is important for improving the capacity and quality of the northeast-western railway channel, improving the layout of the regional road network, accelerating the development of tourism resources along the route and the urbanization process, promoting regional coordinated development, and promoting the implementation of the major development strategy in the west.
Experts say gathering immigration data through U.S. Census is unconstitutional for House seats
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the U.S. federal government, saying the Trump administration’s attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census was ineffective and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brandon, the executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union, told Voice of America: “It’s not going to work.”
She added that Trump’s demands to determine citizenship in the census were difficult and “not very reliable.”
Another civil liberties joint cause group filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump’s executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the board of directors of Arlington County, said: “The U.S. Constitution requires accurate scrutiny of our population every ten years.We must accurately scrutine every person living in Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare people and crush the number of our immigrant communities to succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump’s executive order.
Alabama Justice Minister Marshall said the executive order was a “victory” for the state.
He said, “When allocating the seats in the House of Representatives and the constituencies in each state, they must be based on the number of inhabitants residing in each state and the number of people legally residing.”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from incorporating citizenship issues into the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week that ordered Commercial Secretary Ross, who regulates the Census, to submit data on the uncensored population coming from the census so that the executive authorities could exclude those uncensored population from the census numbers in each state to determine whether each state is increasing or decreasing orining seats in the House of Representatives.
Every ten years, U.S. House seats are redistributed according to demographic changes.

Response to the trend, promote the construction of industrial projects - point of view - Hunan Daily News Network - Huawei Online
In the summer, heat waves.
The enthusiasm for promoting the construction of industrial projects in the province and the release of the field observation festival has covered the heat of the three-volt sky, and the distinctive orientation of "industry rather than strength, and the hero of the project" is inspired by Shenyang.
The development of Hunan has always depended on construction projects and cultivation industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, and went to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and used industrial projects as the "six stable" and "six security" implementation of the "first hand chess".
From the same quarter GDP decreased by 1.9% to the same amount of 1.3% in the first half of the year, during the difficulty, the effort is huge, obviously.
In this valuable record, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for accelerating the economic recovery and stable development in Hunan.
It is reversible and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects must be placed in the general trend of the situation, both good at the momentum, the momentum, the pursuit of the momentum, and good at understanding, seeking change, and responding to change.
In the current complex and severe background of the international situation, in addition to the difficulty of hiring investors, it is also necessary to quietly study the new characteristics of the current situation, more grasp the law, more scientific accuracy, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body, and the mutual promotion of domestic international double cycle.
More emphasis should be placed on enhancing the basic capacity of the industry.
In the first half of the year, there was not only a large number of heavy investment projects in emerging industries, but also a number of traditional advantages of industrial enterprises in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
Yuan Oscart III Science Park project on the existing production line for the transformation, high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line to take the lead; Hunan Zhongnan Smoking and Tobacco Factory new factory area is committed to the process of intelligent transformation, the construction of modern factory, is also a vivid picture of "old trees and new germ" ... around the country's major strategy and "two new one", strive to consolidate the advantages of the industry, actively foster the development of emerging industries, comprehensively increase the scientific and technological innovation and domestic substitution efforts, in order to continuously consolidate the basic conditions, savings transformation momentum.
More attention should be paid to fostering a new model for the development of a new economy.
The sudden new coronavirus epidemic brought the "cloud economy" to the red, stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half, the manufacturing industry of computers and office equipment, electronics and communications equipment industry grew 12.6%, and the online retail sales of wholesale retail enterprises grew 32.2%, and the online meal revenue of catering enterprises grew 35.6%.
In the midst of the crisis, fostering new machines, opening new directions in the midst of change, actively promoting digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, and guiding the development of the integration of the digital economy and the real economy is precisely the trend.
More attention is paid to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain.
Engineering machinery is the main force of the Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential on the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain, not only must the head of the enterprise continue to accumulate, and to technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary to cultivate all over the world, to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction with the strong chain extension chain, promote the coordinated layout of the related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial supply chain.
Hunan is still a good business environment, a hot land and a place where market business opportunities emerge.
Thro the province, there are frequent hints, new hints, and practical hints, believing that the "reduction of burden" of the struggles of enterprises generates the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Zhou Ying implements "shareholder-style" services, for enterprises to do things without pushing, policy fulfillment without discounting, problems are not solved at night ... in the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, various "thousands of thousands", find short tables, and crisis as an opportunity.
A thoughtful research industry, cultivation industry, development industry, solidly and effectively optimize the business environment, and will win the favor of more investors.
The winds are still in the front, but the state of wind-breaking has become the normal of the whole province to build up and down industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must learn well and implement the spirit of important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series, effectively respond to external uncertainty with the certainty of our work, and continuously promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the successful construction of a prosperous society in an all-round way.

Employment and price stability overall indicates the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily, China Economic Network reporter
In the first half of this year, in the face of the shock of the new coronavirus epidemic, China's comprehensive promotion of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, the epidemic prevention and control situation continues to improve, the economic and stable recovery trend is obvious, and the employment and price performance of the people's livelihoods are generally stable, and the Chinese economy has delivered a warm economic performance record.
In the past two months, the unemployment rate has risen.
In particular, in February, many enterprises' production and business activities were basically in the state of stop production, enterprise labor demand was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in towns increased.
As the epidemic prevention and control situation gradually improves, the order of production and life in the whole society is continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of work for steady progress, further increases the impact of macro-policy, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively advances the work of helping enterprises to steadily expand employment.
China's policy to increase the stabilization of jobs, play out the "reduction and delay reimbursement" policy combination, gradual reduction of the payment part of 3 social insurance units, allow for delayed payment of social insurance premiums, expand the unemployment insurance of small and medium-sized and micro enterprises to return stable jobs, benefit from the policy of labor training, to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups to give absorption subsidies, traineeship subsidies, etc.
With the implementation of stable employment policies, the demand for labor in enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the unemployment rate in cities has gradually declined, and in June, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force withdrawn due to the influence of the epidemic returned in the previous period, and in June the participation in urban labor rose by about 10 percentage points compared to February, close to the same period last year.
The data showed that total urban employment in June grew by more than 19% compared to February, most industries reached pre-epidemic levels; the average weekly working time of enterprise employees was 46.8 hours, up 6.6 hours compared to February, slightly higher than 0.1 hours in January.
The same price applies to thousands of people.
In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4 percent, a new high in years.
In February, the CPI increased comparatively, although slightly backward, but was still in the "5 range".
The CPI is at a high level, with both the factor of consumer demand pull before the Spring Festival, and the factor of the Spring Festival wrong month and the lower base of the comparison.
However, the impact of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic on prices is evident.
Influenced by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in February, logistics delays, timely supply of materials, increased transportation costs of materials and other conditions across the country, together with some citizens' accumulation of ransom-purchase, the price of some vital necessities has increased significantly.
In order to respond to the disruption caused by epidemic prevention and control to the pricing situation, relevant departments have incorporated important livelihoods into the emergency transportation protection scope to ensure that the transportation of goods is smooth.
Under the influence of a series of policy initiatives, the supply of the vegetable guava market is strongly secured.
In order to respond to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the introduction of the security and stability policy, various regions and departments quickly implemented, the supply of pork reserves and disposal improved significantly, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and sales was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline in May, driving food prices to rise to 10.6% in the same period; in June, the price of pork has risen slightly, influenced by factors such as slower pork barrier, reduced imports and a recovery in group consumption demand.
The seasonal changes in fresh food prices are marked, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Influenced by the higher comparison base in the same period last year, fruit prices continued to decline in the same period, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half.
The basic life of the masses is effectively safeguarded, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual restoration of transport logistics, the supply and demand conditions in the market have improved.
Starting in March, the CPI ratio decreased for four consecutive months, and the ratio also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the price level has generally recovered.
In the second half of the year, China's goods prices will continue to maintain moderate levels, and the overall inflationary pressure is not great, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and life order under the premise of improving the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and drought in the main production areas of agricultural products such as grain and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely combat disturbance of market order such as accumulation and rising prices.

As an artist, contact is very important to me.
Through my works of art I try to clarify that human beings are not separated from nature but that everything is connected.
I went to Antarctica for the first time about 10 years ago, and I also saw the iceberg for the first time.
I am afraid.
My heart beat fast, my head fainted, trying to understand what this is in front of me.
The iceberg near me floats out of the water almost 200 feet. I can only feel strange that this is a snowflake covered in another snowflake, formed year after year.
Icebergs form when they break from glaciers or break from the ice shelf.
Each iceberg has its own unique personality.
They have a distinct way of interacting with their surroundings and their circumstances.
Some icebergs refuse to compromise and stick to the end, while other icebergs can’t tolerate breaking the ice in a moment of intense passions.
When you see icebergs, it’s easy to think that they’re all isolated, they’re independent, they’re separate, they’re more like what we humans sometimes think of ourselves.
But reality is far more than that.
As the iceberg melted, I breathed into its ancient smell.
As the icebergs melt, it releases mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes everything.
I began to photograph these icebergs as if I was photographing portraits of my ancestors, learning that in these individual moments the icebergs originally existed in that way but will never exist again.
When they melt, it is by no means death; it is by no means an end, but a continuation of the path to life.
I’ve photographed icebergs, some of which are very young — thousands of years old.
Some of them have been on ice for over 100,000 years.
The last picture I want to show you is a iceberg I took on Kekertsuatsiak in Greenland.
It was a very difficult opportunity for everyone to actually witness a iceberg rolling.
This is as shown in the picture.
On the left you can see a small boat.
It was a 15 foot boat.
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg it deforms on the surface of the water.
Here you see it start to roll, the little boat moves to the other side, and a man stands there.
This is an average size Greenland iceberg.
It floats out of the surface about 120 feet high or 40 meters high.
This video was filmed in real time.
Like this iceberg, they show everyone the different aspects of their personality.
thank you .

Qinghai Hainan July 26th Topic: Qinghai Lake "Flower Sea Live Broadcast" "Sweet" with goods to help farmers increase revenue
The author is Pan Rain.
"On the shore of the Shenzhen Sea Lake, full of eyes and flowers, the bees are dancing, here the altitude is higher, the day and night temperatures are large, the air pollution is less, the strong light has nurtured the most stubborn, generous bee population, and has created the characteristics of the Shenzhen Sea bee pulp with high activity, high protein, rich in nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
Zhang Zhenong, deputy director of the Industrial and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Province in Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products was held on the shore of Qinghai Lake, China bee products association and representatives of entrepreneurs, beekeepers and other parties gathered together to jointly promote Qinghai specialty bee products, online sales of 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Highlands Beekeepers, with a total shipment of 3.8 million yuan.
Exhibition of beekeeping products.
It is that the live broadcasting activities, using the Beijing Hoodie Bee Industry chain store network, Fast Hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live broadcasts, e-commerce platforms, promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + farmers", and continuously issue to consumers through online and offline channels "Qinghai Highlands Spring Mushroom Consumption Tickets", the company is expected to yield a total profit of 5.28 million yuan throughout the year.
In this regard, Beijing Chongqing Bee Industry Co., Ltd. president Zina believes that "it is worth it" "This move can expand the awareness of Qinghai bees products, attract more consumers to understand, like pure natural bees products without adding, and drive beekeeping to increase revenue".
At present, the company has signed a strategic production cooperation agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Limited and Qinghai Bee Industry Co-operative Company, and jointly promotes the long-term development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.

This spring, because of the prevention and control of the epidemic, the need to set road traffic barriers, the path of bee farmers "following flowers after honey" is blocked, many bees die because of missing the period of flora and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers is severely affected.
"At the beginning of the year, the beekeepers followed the long journey, from Yunnan, Sichuan and the way to the north to the northwestern region, they dined and stayed and lived in no settlement, very hard.
As a company, we have a responsibility to help them.”
Jonna said.
“Little bees are ‘environmental reconnaissance soldiers’, and the polluted regions can’t survive too much bees.”Zhao Xiaokawa, executive vice president of the Chinese Bee Products Association, said that pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and has an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bees pollination can increase crop production, especially in areas with widespread and poorly managed conditions, pollination is more meaningful.
Research data show that pollination can increase the production of peanuts by about 15-30%.
China Bee Products Association executive vice president Zhao Xiaokawa (right) promoted Qinghai Bee products.
“The economic, ecological and social benefits of bee pollination are far greater than the value of beekeeping products themselves, and the beekeeping industry has huge potential in terms of human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, which has been known very little.”
Zhao Xiao said.
And nowadays, the number of beekeepers is becoming less and less, in addition to the regular year-on-year beekeepers, there are still many disabled poor households who choose to join cooperatives with beekeepers.
"The state has financial support, we contact technical personnel to help guide, beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, to open the sales path also needs the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, industrial associations."
Zhao Xiao said.
“We hope that in the future we will pay more attention to supporting beekeepers,” she said, “and our beekeeping products will be rigorously screened and controlled in accordance with national standards to ensure quality, while helping beekeepers protect consumer rights and interests.”
Under the influence of continued rainfall, since July 22, the land of Chongqing Woolong district and the village of Six井 village in the middle of the city of Zhejiang collapsed, a large area of sliding deformation occurred, completely blocked along the river, forming 13 meters before the dam water level, and an estimated reservoir water capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters.
In order to ensure navigation safety, the Chongqing maritime department decided to implement temporary traffic controls on the waters of the Yangtze River River to the viewing beach.
According to the Chongqing meteorological and hydrological department monitoring, since the 25th, Chongqing central and western and northeastern regions have generally rained to heavy rain, some regions to heavy rain, and local heavy rain.
The highest level of water will appear on the 26th night, and the highest level of water will be close to the alert level.
In order to ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic controls on the waters of the Yangtze River border to the observation beach.
After consultation with the Chongqing Municipal Defense Office and Meteorological, Water, Hydrological and other departments and units for emergency consultations, the Chongqing Municipal Depression and Drought Resistance Command Department decided to issue River Flood Level III early warning information and start the Depression and Water Resistance Level IV emergency response.
Chongqing Municipal Water Resistance Command Department requires that Chongqing, Jiangxi, Shandong Dam, Chongqing, Wuhan and other district counties and Chongqing Municipal Defense relevant member units should pay great attention to the rain conditions, especially the Changzhou, Carling River, and Ujing river rising water changes, analyze the investigation in advance, issue early warning, strengthen inspection guard, resolutely evacuate the displacement of the people in the threatened areas, timely mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials, quickly and efficiently handle the disaster (danger) situation, and avoid the occurrence of mass casualties.
The Ambassador General of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos took part in the sacrifice ceremony together with representatives of the Laos Vietnam Buddhist Association, the Laos Vietnamese General Assembly, representatives of the Government of the Welsh Province, and the Laos Veterans Association.
The opening ceremony was held in a solemn atmosphere, and the delegates continued to appeal to the heroes, commemorating the heroes' great achievements and the special relationship of solidarity.
In his speech, General Ambassador Xi Jinping expressed that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and the Lao people to jointly commemorate the revolutionary heroism of the two countries, together to express their gratitude for the fierce sacrifice for freedom and independence of the two countries, and at the same time it is a good opportunity for the people of the two countries to recall and work together to combat the common enemy, fight for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development and consolidate bilateral relations.
74 years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 veterans of the Old Vietnam Fighting Alliance were heroically sacrificed while attacking the Phonehe base.
The victory of this offensive is a historic victory for the two countries in the early stages of the national liberation revolutionary struggle.
Ms. Zheng emphasized that the people of the two countries will always remember the heroic sacrifices for the cause of the national liberation struggle of the two countries, while emphasizing that the young people of the two countries will continue to promote the heroic and strong traditions of the older ancestors, and make the due contribution to the continued flowering results of older relations and the prosperity and development of the two countries.
A milestone has passed!
International Milan unlocked the 3000th match - in new net
On the morning of the 26th Beijing time, the milestone of the battle was met in Milan.
According to Italian media statistics, the home game against Genoa is the 3000th in the history of the International Milan League, and the Blue Black Army is also the first team to unlock this milestone.
Since the reorganization of the league in 1929, Inter Milan has been the only team that has never missed the league and the only team that has never downgraded.
According to Italian media reports, the match between Milan and Genoa is the 3000th in the history of the Blue Black Army team.
In this milestone battle, Milan International defeated Geneva with three goals.
This role Lukakuwe opened two times, and Sanchez, who replaced the venue, also contributed a ball.
The game entered the pace of International Milan from the beginning, and the strong attack finally turned into a goal in the 34th minute.
On the left side of the road, Lukaku broke the head of the ball.
The 82nd minute international Milan like French artillery, Moses breaking the right road after passing, Sanchez midway packing pushed; before the final, Lukaku completed the second grade of Mayweather, in the counterattack, Brozovich sent a long distance straight, Lukaku rushed into the blockade zone over Romero after pushing the golden goal, will be scored at 3:0.
International Milan field 3:0 defeat Geneva, points against Super Atlanta rose to 2nd, in the case of a multi-match behind the leading sheep Juventus 4 points, still retaining the hope of the championship.
So far, in the 3,000 league matches spanning 90 squares, Milan won 1,489 of them, scoring 834 and losing 677 with a victory rate of 49.6%.

The statement said the drone crashed in Libya when the Israeli military performed a mission near the “blue line” on the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media that the drone may have crashed.
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Gantz said that afternoon during his inspection of the northern Israeli region that Israel would continue to take action in Syria and Lebanon to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded Hezbollah as a major security threat and has accused Iran of delivering weapons to Hezbollah through the Syrian land corridor to Lebanon as a result of tensions around the border with Lebanon.
Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes on Syrian targets in order to combat the group.
Spy War drama old face Liu Yun Long plays a broken man protagonist - New China Network
Supervised and directed by Liu Yuanlong, Liu Yuanlong, Suzhou, Liu Liu, Liu Liu Group and others starred in the big spy drama "Winning", landed in Guangdong at 7:30 p.m. on July 16 and watched the "Vital Theatre".
The drama tells the story of the underground Party member of the Communist Party of China, Tang Fei (Liou Yonglong), a joint Soviet agent who hides in the Japanese police station, murdered the head of the Japanese agent and crushed the Japanese army's horrifying conspiracy.
Based on historical modifications, the material is taken from the dust-sealed Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defensive battle in Moscow, the Soviet Red Army advanced to the Far East with sharp western aid, at this time the Japanese Guangdong Army "Northern Army" believed that it was organic and willing to enter the army.
In order to resolve the threat of the enemy, the Communist Party of China and Soviet intelligence personnel joined forces to implement the "Mudan Ural" plan.
Based on this historical background, the well-known writer Deng Xiaoping has been melted several times, causing the drama to burn the brain.
Liu Yuanlong played the role of supervision and male protagonist at the same time in "Success".
In the drama, he plays Dong Fei, the head of the criminal department of the Forest River Police Department, a sympathetic or even a bit ugly Cuban police officer, the real identity is a CPC underground party member.
With its opponent play, the protagonist Tsai Dream is the head of the Lin Hui Security Bureau, profoundly appreciated by the Japanese superior Fukuoka, and there is a subtle relationship between Dong Fei and also hostile and friendly, ambiguous.
In recent years, Suzhou has tried a lot of different types of roles, from "Those Years We Were Young" in Land Yooning to "Yongzhi Aggression" in El Shun, all impressed the audience, and the acting was recognized.
This time Suzhou and Liu Yonglong were the first partners, and the Sheriff of Zuba combined with the setting of beautiful female police, with a lot of views and new ideas.
In addition to the two main characters, in the "Win Calculator" there are also Liang Coronghuang, Li Li, Wangbo, Rayhan, Sheng Military and other numerous powered actors joining, the old drama is also one of the viewpoints of the drama.
It is understood that the production of "Within" is also very good, and the team filmed almost 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning 3 provinces.
In order to restore the urban appearance of the northeast and southern part of the period, the artwork team day and night rushed to work, carefully grinding the scene and every detail of the item, so that the scene picture is sophisticated and rich in historical texture.
Floods in two provinces in western Yemen kill 16 people
According to Yemeni local media reports on 26 July, heavy rainfall in the western provinces of Hodeida and Hajer in Yemen, in the last 48 hours floods have caused at least 16 people to die.
According to the report, floods caused by the rains in Hodeida Province killed 13 people, and three people in the nearby Hadee province died in the flooding.
In addition, dozens of houses in the northern and southern provinces of Hodeida were destroyed by floods, and some roads and farmland were damaged in varying degrees.
Years of military conflict have caused Yemen’s health system to collapse.
According to statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million and the number of deaths has exceeded 2,000.
Yemeni health agencies are concerned that continued floods could cause the cholera outbreak to spread again.

Directed by the youth director High and Strong, Liu William, East宇, Yang Hyun, Wang Yongbo and other protagonists of the network film "Nepal Out" officially appeared in Aikido.
The film tells the story of the falling boxer Venus returning to the boxing board and fighting for dignity, showcasing a bloody and bloody journey of dreaming.
With Thailand as the main plot, the "Tai Chi" as the starting point of the dream of Venus, the whole story is carried out under the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values, whether it is the determination of the pre-Venus period to play the Fake Chi for the Master, or the later period in the support of friends and lovers to revive as a fight for dignity, all show the pursuit and love of men in the traditional Chinese culture for family and dreams.
Combined with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong combination of professional teams from China and Thailand, the game will not only show the effect of internationalization, but will also impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, the "Highland Out" showed a lot of the drama of Thai fighting and training, the intense and bloody scene.
In the film, played by the game designer Zhang Xiao through the fighting game to help Venus played by Liu William back to the box and remove the crown of the plot, combine the novelty of high-tech with the hot-blooded competition, also demonstrates the brotherhood of Zhang Xiao and Venus seemingly "different" and real goals.
In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and the crystal is also very impressive, and the silent support of Venus and the firm commitment of Venus to the crystal have made the audience see the "Third Man's gentleness" on Venus, and also added a lot of personality to the falling king.
The four sectors jointly.

Shanghai State Capital to Transfer 17.5% of Shares - Economic Observatory Network - Professional Financial News Website
On July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued a suggestive announcement on the transfer of a part of the company's shares and redemption of the license by means of an agreement between state-owned shareholders intending to publicly recruit the concessionary party.
In order to further deepen the reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of the layout of state-owned capital, and improve the equity structure of green land, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai City Invest (Group) Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City Invest") will transfer the shares of the company held by agreement through public recruitment of the concessionary party, and the share share share of the planned transfer shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of green land.
The price of the shares to be transferred shall not be lower than the highest of the following two: the arithmetic average of the weighted average daily price for the first 30 trading days of the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020) and the audited net asset value per share of the Company in the last financial year.
At present, the new strategic investor of green land is still uncertain, according to the information published in the announcement, the new strategic investor to take the 17.5% shareholding transferred in the mixed transfer of green land will need to pay about 14 billion yuan of funds.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, greenland is expected to remain out of control of shareholders and actual controllers, but the structure of control may change significantly.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out several institutional mechanism reforms: in 1992-1997, under the state-owned system, it operated according to the market rules; in 1997-2013, it established and continuously improved the shares system of state-owned holdings and employee holdings; in 2013-2015, strategic investors were introduced to form state-owned and non-public capital cross-holding and interconnected mixed ownership; and in 2015 to date, the overall listing has become a public company.
Greenland's current mixed-up scheme is similar to GREEN, in December 2019, GREENGREEN has taken over 15% of GREENGREEN Electric (000651.SZ) with 416.6 billion yuan, GREENGREEN Group has withdrawn to small shareholders, and after completing the mixed-up, GREENGREEN has implemented a modern corporate management method such as executive incentive plan, no man-control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are all state-owned enterprise groups owned by the Shanghai State Capital Commission, Zhang Yuan, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that this move is an important measure in Shanghai in accordance with the Party Central Committee's requirements to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises in a new phase, fully showing the new approach to reform due to land-friendliness and quantitative dressing, through the introduction of new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, support enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, improve the freedom of business management, and accelerate the comprehensive release of reform vitality.
Cross-provincial tourism resumed the country's first cross-provincial car tourism special series opened - New China Network
Xinhua news agency Hangzhou, July 25 (reporter Li Ping) at 12:20 on July 25, more than 200 Shanghai tourists on the D771 drive, successfully arrived in Zhejiang Province Lanzhou City, which is also the first cross-provincial car tourism special for the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed the cross-provincial (district, city) team trip on July 14.
Located in Zhejiang central-western Lanzhou City, the landscape is magnificent, the territory has many popular attractions such as the Gong Gong Village, the underground Long River, the Chiang Mai Village, in the two-day and one-night journey, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will experience these attractions one by one.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that the company, according to the latest policy, closely looked at the demand for savings travel, first time to communicate with the city of Lanzhou, carefully launched the "Shanghai to Lanzhou" and "Summer Reward Two Day Tour" products, and the product launched in less than a week.
Tante Sun from Shanghai said that she has not been out this year due to the outbreak.
"At home for a long time, when I saw a team trip, I immediately shared the news with friends and signed up, and never before came to Lancashire, and I look forward to this trip."
It is understood that in September last year, Lanzhou City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Limited signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the "high-speed railway and high-speed railway" project, and plans to launch 12 high-speed railway travel to Lanzhou in the four locations within a year.

U.S. White House adviser "anti-bite" states back to work too early
U.S. White House Advisors Return to Work Too Early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of cases worldwide.
For months, U.S. President Trump has repeatedly asked all states to resume work and re-school, until recently changed their attitude, actively wearing masks in public, and his advisors are "anti-bite" that some state governments resume work too early.
White House adviser Kylie Conway said at a news conference on Monday that some state governments did not comply with the standards of re-working and re-opened places such as bars too early.
Conway also noted that previous claims that the president had "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of state work were misleading rumors.
“The president is a federalist, and he believes that every state has autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the “rumors” in Conway were spoken by Trump personally at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-facing operation has been mocked by netizens as "rewrite history".
Kylie Conway wants to rewrite history, she’s a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Grazen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on shutting down.
Trump wants to push back to work so he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time that Kylie Conway has raised controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway said, “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, and was crazy mocked by netizens: without common sense, look at the newspapers!
Recently, we have witnessed the impact of cyber attacks on the business world.
Data breaches from companies such as JPMorgan, Yahoo, Home and Tagit have resulted in losses of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.
In a few more such attacks, the entire world economy would collapse.
The public sector cannot be avoided either.
Between 2012 and 2014, a very serious data breach occurred in the U.S. Office of Human Resources.
Security licenses and fingerprint information were stolen, affecting 22 million employees.
You may also have heard of some government-funded hackers trying to use the stolen data to influence the election outcome in some countries.
Two recent cases, one of which was the massive data theft of the German Bundestag, and one of the Democratic National Committee email theft.
Cyber threats have affected our democratic processes.
There is also an increasing trend.
The more advanced computer technology is, the more vulnerable the means we use to protect data.
In particular, a new computer technology, called quantum computing, uses the microparticles of nature to greatly increase the computing capabilities of computers.
Its computing capabilities are so powerful that it can break down many of the encryption systems we use today.
Are we no longer hopeless?
Should we start packing up electronic survival equipment to meet the coming end of data?
I don’t think that step is yet.
Quantum computers exist only in the laboratory, and it will take years before they are actually used.
More importantly, there have been many major breakthroughs in the field of crypto.
For me, this is a very exciting time in the history of security communications.
About 15 years ago, I learned that we unlocked new skills that could create quantum effects that didn’t exist in nature.
The idea of using the basic laws of physics to advance the development of encryption technology is exciting to me.
Today, a number of selected companies and laboratories, including mine, have pushed this technology to the stage of practical application.
Yes is right.
We intend to use quantum to fight quantum.
How to realize?
First, let’s quickly understand the world of encryption.
You need a suitcase and you have some important documents to give to your good friend, James Bond, to lock it up and be safe.
Because these materials are highly confidential, we use a super-advanced package.
It comes with a special password lock, once it is locked, it converts the content of the file into random numbers.
So you just put the file in and lock it, this time the file has been converted to a random number, and you send this package to James.
When the bag has not been sent, you call him and tell him the password.
Once he got the package, entered the password, and the document was completely decoded, you succeeded in passing a copy of the encrypted information to James Bond.
(Laughter) A fun example, but it illustrates the three focuses of encryption.
Password – we call it the encryption key.
You can imagine it as a code.
Tell James the code.
We call it a secret key transmission.
This ensures that we can send the key safely to the specified location.
As well as locks used to encrypt and decrypt files.
We call it encryption.
Through the secret key, it converts the content in the file into random numbers.
A good algorithm can do this, and without a secret key it is difficult to decipher the password.
The importance of the algorithm lies in the fact that if someone gets a package and opens it, without a secret key, and does not know the encryption algorithm, they will not be able to read the content in the document.
There are only some random numbers.
Most security systems rely on a secure way of passing the key to the right place.
However, fast-growing computing capabilities are compromising many of the key delivery methods we currently use.
For example, we are now applying a very broad system – RSA.
When it was invented in 1977, it took about 40 trillion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.
In 1994, only 17 years later, the code was cracked.
As computers get stronger, the passwords we need are getting longer.
Nowadays we often use 2048 or 4096 bit passwords.
As you can see, the battle between the encryptors and the decryptors is ongoing, both trying to defeat each other.
In the next 10 to 15 years, the advent of quantum computers will break down the complex mathematical algorithms that are the basis of the encryption systems we use today.
In fact, quantum computers will turn our safe castles into one-touch card houses.
We want to protect our castle.
Many research institutions have emerged in recent years to study how to enhance encryption with quantum effects.
People have made some exciting breakthroughs.
Remember the 3 key points of encryption? high-quality key, secure key transfer and strong algorithms.
However, advances in science and engineering have compromised these two priorities.
The first is the secret key.
Random numbers are the basis of the secret key.
But by today, they are no longer truly random.
Currently, we generate secret keys, which are generated by software based on random number frequencies, which we call false random numbers.
A program or mathematical method generates numbers, and there will always be some, not so obvious, rules in it.
The lower the randomness of these numbers, or in terms, the lower the magnesium they contain, the easier they are to predict.
Recently, some casinos have been attacked, and the way to attack is very creative.
They targeted the slot machine to shoot for a while, and then analyzed it.
Cybercriminals use reverse engineering to create a false random digital generator behind the switch.
As a result, they have a high probability of predicting the turn of the turn, thus earning a lot of money.
The key is also insecure.
Having a genuine random number generator is important for generating secure passwords.
For years, researchers have been working hard to create real random digital generators.
But most designs are either not random enough, or not fast enough, or difficult to reuse.
But the quantum world is truly random.
Using this real randomness is very important.
Devices capable of measuring quantum effects can very quickly generate a continuous stream of random numbers.
The casino crime that I mentioned is no longer possible.
A number of universities and companies from around the world are focused on making real random digital generators.
In my company, our Quantum Random Digital Generator was born on a 2m long 1m wide optical table.
Then we reduce it to a box size.
Today, it is already possible to put it on a PCI card and plug it into an ordinary computer.
This is the fastest, truly random digital generator in the world.
It can generate a billion random numbers per second by measuring quantum effects.
Today, it has been widely used around the world to enhance the security of cloud service providers, banks and government agencies.
(Applause) But even with a real random digital generator, we are still facing the second biggest cybersecurity threat: the issue of secure key transmission.
Current key transfer technology cannot fight quantum computers.
The quantum solution to this problem, called the quantum key distribution, abbreviated as QKD, uses a base in quantum mechanics that violates the intuitive properties.
Observing the behavior of microparticles changes this particle.
Let me give an example.
Let’s think back, to give the password to James Bond.
But this time, we didn’t call him, we used the quantum effect, carrying the code with a laser beam, and passing it to James through the ordinary fiber.
Let’s assume Dr. Noah wants to get that code.
Fortunately, Dr. Noah will leave electronic fingerprints while trying to intercept this quantum secret key, both James and you can notice.
Thus, the blocked key will be canceled.
The secret key that remains provides strong protection for the data.
Because this security mechanism is based on the fundamental principles of physics, it is impossible for quantum computers, or any future supercomputers, to break it.
My team and I are working with many of the top universities and the defense sector to improve this exciting technology and develop the next generation of security products.
The Internet of Things predicts an age of high connectivity, with an estimated 250 to 30 billion devices accessing the Internet by 2020.
In the Internet of Things world, trust in these connected device systems is crucial for our society to function properly.
We believe that quantum technology will be crucial to building that trust, and it will ensure that we enjoy these magical innovations to the fullest, and enjoy these colorful innovations that enrich our lives.
Thanks to everyone.

3-year-old child college playground was stolen, and after compensation, it is right to appeal to the school?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Juridical Daily Author: Wang Shui Responsibility Editor: Wang Shui
The playground was destroyed, and the children were repaid after the school.
The newspaper's spokesman Zhao Zhao
Three-year-old Klein was playing at a university playground, accidentally struck by Chen of the barge team when he scored the ball.
After Chen's compensation, Mr. Wen's father, as the legal agent of Mr. Wen, appealed to the school to the court, asking for an apology for the school where the event took place, and paid a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and mental injury relief.
Recently, the people's court in Beijing's Haidian district decided that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, had fulfilled its appropriate security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's lawsuit request.
Mr. Moon claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he played with Mr. Moon on the school playground, when he was training the back team on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Mr. Xiao, Mr. Wang and many other children and parents operate within the safe areas designated by the team.
But then the team member Chen Mou lost his hand when he casted the ball, which caused the ball to fly over the defensive net to the above-mentioned safety zone and hit the back of the brain of the small and medium-sized.
Mr. Wen immediately took Mr. Wen to the hospital for treatment, and was diagnosed with a head injury.
Mr. Wang believes that the facilities on the school stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities have not been effectively managed.
The fault of the school has caused the above events to occur, which has caused great physical and mental suffering, but also brought greater suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protection net on the playground, and posted management regulations, training notifications, telling the entrance to the playground must be kept at a safe distance from the training site and reminded to pay attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove the school "not fulfilled its security obligations", so disagree with compensation.
After the trial, the court concluded that the site of the incident belonged to the place where the university was open to the public for free, and the school, although there is a security obligation for the management of the playground, but this security obligation must only meet the general obligation of attention.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, has fulfilled the appropriate security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xi Jinping for the medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than two thousand yuan in accordance with the previous compensation agreement, the two sides agreed to solve the dispute once and for all.
After the incident, the parents again claimed compensation from the school, and the court ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected in its entirety.
After the verdict, neither of the parties appealed, and the verdict has now entered into force.
Article 37 The school, as the administrator of a public place, has a security obligation; in the event that the actions of third parties cause harm to others, the third party shall bear the responsibility for the infringement, and the administrator of a public place who fails to fulfill the security obligation shall bear the corresponding supplementary responsibility.
The judge said that because the administrator of a public place is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, to anticipate the possible dangers and damages, so that it is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the minimum cost of the damage occurring, so that the law stipulates that the obligation to engage in social activities.
In the present case, the school's security obligations for the non-specific access to the playgrounds open to the public free of charge should be in accordance with the social activities it engages in, in particular, mainly the basic security measures should be taken and the obligation to be informed of the dangers of concealment.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose too high security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has taken the set up of the safety net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school has no fault and should not bear legal liability.
In addition, for third-party infringements, even if the administrator of public places such as schools did not fulfill its security obligations, its responsibilities are also assumed as a supplement to damages, according to the latest issued Civil Code, the administrator will bear additional responsibilities, can also be recovered to third parties.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the direct offender.
Today I want to show you how we will produce things in the future.
I am confident that soon our buildings and machines will be able to self-assemble, self-replicate and self-repair.
So I want to show you what I think of the current state of manufacturing, and then compare it with some natural systems.
So in the current manufacturing industry, we have skyscrapers — — two-and-a-half years, half a million parts, very complex, using new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.
We have exciting machines that can take us into space—five years, two hundred and fifty million pieces.
But on the other hand, if we look at the natural system, we have two million types of proteins that can fold in ten thousand nanoseconds, and we can replicate DNA with three billion bases pairs in about an hour.
This is the complexity of our natural systems, but they are very efficient, more efficient than anything we build, more complex than anything we can build.
They are more efficient in terms of energy.
They rarely make mistakes.
They can repair themselves for a long life.
There is something super interesting about the natural system.
If we can transform it into our building environment, then the way we build things will have great potential.
I think the key is self-assembly.
If we want to use self-assembly in our own physical environment, I think there are four key factors.
The first is that we need to decode all the complexity of what we are going to build—that is, our buildings and machines.
We need to decode them into simple sequences—basically the DNA of our building.
Then we need a programable portion that accepts this sequence and is used for folding or reshaping.
We need some energy to activate, so that these parts of us can fold up according to the procedure.
We need some kinds of redundant correction to ensure that we successfully build what we want.
So I want to show you some of the projects I and my colleagues are underway to this self-assembled future.
The first two projects were MacroBot and Decibot.
These projects were large-scale reconstructable robots—a 8-foot, 12-foot long protein.
They are embedded in mechanical equipment, sensors.
You need to decode the way you want to fold into, decode into a series of angles——negative 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees, 0 degrees, zero, 120 degrees, negative 120 degrees,—something like this; a series of angles, or turns, can be passed by a wire.
Each unit gets its own message —— such as a negative 120. it rotates, checks if it rotates to place and then passes the sequence to its neighbors.
There are many outstanding scientists, engineers, and designers working for this project.
I think this project really reveals: Is it really scalable?
I mean, it would cost thousands of dollars to many people to build this eight-foot robot.
Can we really expand it? can we really embed robots in every part?
The next issue is looking at passivity, or passively trying to make restructuring programable.
But it goes a step further, it tries to make actual calculations.
Basically embedded in most basic modules of computing, the digital logic gateway, directly into each section.
This is the non-door.
Each door to be used for calculation has a quadratic body, with two input quadratic bodies.
One is the input from the user, just like you’re building bricks.
The other is the input of a brick placed before coming.
Then it will give the output of three-dimensional space.
This means users stack the bricks the way they want.
It is calculated based on what you have done before and your instructions.
Now it begins to move in three-dimensional space—up or down.
Look to the left,[1,1] the input is equal to 0 output, representing downward.
On the right, the input [0,0] is 1 output, representing upwards.
So the real meaning is that our structure now contains the blueprint we want to build.
So all the information about what you want to build is embedded in it.
This means that we have some form of self-replication.
For this situation, I call it self-directed replication because your structure contains accurate blueprints.
If there is an error, you can replace a part.
All local information is embedded in it, telling you how to fix it.
So you have something you can climb, read it, and output one by one.
It is directly embedded; no external instructions are input.
The last project I’m going to show you, called The Chain of Prejudice, is probably the most exciting example of the passive self-assembly system we’re seeing now.
It has reconstructibility and programmability that make it a completely passive system.
Basically, you have a series of elements.
Every element is exactly the same, and they are biased.
Each chain, or each element, wants to turn to the right or to the left.
If you want to assemble a chain, you need to program it.
Tell each unit to turn left or right.
When you shake the chain, it folds up and programmes any structure you have encoded for it—so in this case, a spiral, fire that situation, two interconnected cubes.
Basically, you can program in a three-dimensional space—or one-dimensional or two-dimensional—that chain is entirely passive.
What kind of future does this predict to us?
I think it tells us the possibilities of this self-assembly, self-replication, and self-repair in our body structure, our buildings, and our machines.
There is new programmability in these sections.
From there you can get new calculation possibilities.
We will have spatial calculations.
Imagine our buildings, bridges, machines, and all the bricks can be actually calculated.
What amazing parallel and distributed computing capabilities and new design possibilities.
This is an exciting potential.
I think the projects I show you are just a small step toward the future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembled world.
thank you .

Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness has increased.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to rebound.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism operations from July 21, the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, has met a peak of passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists coming to Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects the summer season to send 3.7 million passengers, while the airport passenger flow is mainly based on students, tourism, and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually recovered, with Xiamen Airport operating an average of 440 flights per day in July, with domestic flights recovering to 80% before the outbreak.
The airline encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an, and seized the recovered tourism market.
At present, several travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of domestic cross-country travel products in the summer, and the team's trip mainly focuses on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger traffic peak of railway stations and airports, relevant units have sent more people to evacuate in the area where people can be gathered in checkboards, security control channels, and other areas, Fujian also optimized and upgraded the "Eight-Pong Health Code", achieved health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoted an orderly recovery in the tourism market.
Liu DeWar Liu Qing Yun Can "Remove" New Fireworks - New China Network
“Dismantle Experts 2” has recently announced that it will be released on December 24th, becoming the first film in the Halo Archive.
The second film is still directed by Churchill, and Liu Dewar is supervised and starred with a completely new story.
It is that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" elements in the second part has also made the challenge faced by the demolition experts more difficult, and a few shocking glances have been announced, the big explosion of the mushroom cloud, swallowed by the fire of the airport, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, the production of the former classman Hor, the "Removing Bomb Expert", won the fifth-first class box office champion of the year, and won 7 nominations in the Hong Kong film statue prize, Chung Cheng Tao x Liu Dewu also became the gold partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, the "Removing Experts 2", is also once again looking forward to whether this pair of cards combination can wipe out a new spark.
Demolition Specialist 2 tells a new story: former demolition expert Pan Yuan (Louis Dewar) fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed by the police as a suspect.
In order to find the truth, he had to seek help from a friend of the demolition expert, Deng Xiaoping (刘青云饰).
The female inspector who is eager to break the case, and also the former girlfriend of Pan (Nani) are involved.
Still the demolition expert, but from the archival forecast can feel the complexity of the new role of Liu de Huang: broken a leg, wearing the joint limb, while being chased by Liu Qing Yun, who is the demolition expert, while also by the former girlfriend Nanny commanded the operation.
What exactly was the relationship between the three, what Liu Dewar did at the Shandong Hotel, in what kind of cases he was involved, and what turmoil he experienced in his career as a demolition expert, various mysteries are curious.
It is understood that the main drama of the film is a field view of Hong Kong's world landmark building, coupled with the top special effects production team, bringing a shocking realistic visual impact.

Russian satellite network that July 26 is the Russian Navy Day, celebrating the main parade of the Navy Day held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin arrived in Kronstadt to attend the celebration, where 15 ships and submarines were inspected.
On July 28, 2019, the Russian Navy Day was celebrated in St. Petersburg.
According to reports, Putin congratulated the Navy officers on Navy Day and drove a small boat over the Gulf of Finland from next to the vessels to participate in the maritime parade, followed by a subjective audition of the read troops.
The Russian Navy is equipped with the latest types of ships and special equipment, and the level of equipment is constantly improving.
At the Russian Navy Day parade, Putin said: “The Russian Navy has military ships equipped with high-end weapons, strategic diving cruisers and multi-purpose submarines, aircraft such as the latest aircraft, unique weapons and special equipment.”
On June 24, Russia held a parade on the Red Square to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the victory in the Patriotic War.
He also said that the Russian Navy will gain a unique advantage with digital and effective defense means.
The main naval parades to celebrate the Russian Navy Day were held in St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, with a total of 46 ships participating, including the escort ship "Kassatonov" and the large anti-submarine ship "Kurakov" of the Navy, as well as large landing ships, small missile ships, escort ships and submarines.
Among them, the series of ships was statically displayed along the St. Petersburg Winter Palace bridge, most notably the first Russian warships "Portava" in the early 18th century, which was replicated.
To prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, only local residents and special guests were allowed to enter Kronstadt during the naval parade this year.
The last Sunday of July is Russian Navy Day.
Yang Huan, founder of the Beijing Love Chord, died at the age of 86 - China's New Network
Xi Jinping News (reporter Liu Zhi) on July 26, Beijing Love Chord announced that Beijing Love Chord founder, China's famous conductor, music educator, life-long academic committee of the Central Academy of Music, command department professor Yang Huan, due to invalid medical treatment, died at 13:55 on July 26, 2020 in Beijing, aged 86.
Photo from the Beijing Amusement Group website.
Yang Huan was born in 1934, Jiangsu Nanjing, who loved music from childhood.
In 1951 he was the commander of the Nanjing People's Radio Chorus, and in the autumn of 1951 he was admitted to the Shanghai Chinese Oriental Division's major music department, where he studied from Professor Yang Karen and German commander Hitzman, and studied the style and reconfiguration of the song with former Soviet expert Alzamanov.
In 1958 he taught at the Beijing Artist's Academy of Music, and in 1973 he was transferred to the Central Academy of Music's composition department and command department.
Yang Hong founded the Beijing Love Choir in 1983.
For more than 30 years, he has adhered to the purpose of "love and dedication", leading the choir around the world, and has won dozens of grand prizes in important competitions at home and abroad.
He has previously directed the performance of more than 30 groups such as the Central Orchestra Choral, Central National Choral, Oriental Choral, Shanghai Choral, and held several symphony concerts and choir concerts.
His works include "Band Training", "Chorus Training", "Two Songs Writing", "Children's Song Collection" (upstream) and papers "On Chord Chord Questions", "On the sound layer layout of the orchestra", and translations "Chorus Composer Law" and "The Chord Language of Debussy".
Do you know how many flowers there are?
There are 250,000 species — at least as many as we know — of the 250,000 flowering plants.
Flowers are a problem.
It is very difficult to reproduce plants.
It takes a lot of experience and a lot of resources.
Why so disturbing?
Of course, the answer is, like so many other things in the world, gender.
I know what you think when you look at these pictures.
The reason why sexual reproduction is so important -- plants have many other ways to reproduce.
It can be used in the form of branches; it can be reproduced in the same strain; it can be pollinated in the same strain.
But they do need to spread their genes mixed with other genes so that they can eco-environment.
Evolution is how it works.
Now the way plants transmit this information is through pollen.
Some of you may have seen these pictures before.
As I said, every household should have a scan electron microscope that can see these.
How many different types of pollen there are.
This is very useful in forensic medicine.
Most of what causes us to suffer pollen heat comes from those plants that use the wind to spread pollen.This is a very inefficient process, which is why the pollen always runs into our noses.
Because most of them were abandoned, the reproductive cells contained in the pollen, the male reproductive cells, would happen to fall on another flower.
All the grass, which means all the grain, and most of the trees spread the pollen by the wind.
But most species actually use insects to complete this process.In a way, this is smarter, because it doesn’t require a lot of pollen.
Insects and other species can carry pollen, transferring it directly to where it is needed.
Obviously, we note the relationship between insects and plants.
It’s a kind of symbiosis, and whether birds or bees, they’re all rewarded, and the reward they usually get is honey.
Sometimes this symmetry leads to wonderful adaptive changes—the red dress is a beautiful adaptive change.
Plants also harvest, and heaven spreads pollen elsewhere.
Plants evolved, creating landing tracks everywhere, and bees could get lost in them.
On many plants, some look like markers of other insects.
These are butterfly’s pollen bags, very clever, so when an unknown insect falls on it, the pollen bags turn around and hit the insect’s back with a lot of pollen so that it can follow the insects to other plants.
There is a species of flower that looks like it has a chickenpox. To some extent, it does; it forces insects to climb over, stick to the pollen, and take the pollen elsewhere.
There are at least twenty-thousand species of lambda — an astonishing variety.
They have various tricks.
They must try and attract pollinators to help them complete the process.
This flower, known as Darwin's flower, because it was studied by Darwin and gave wonderful predictions when he saw this flower.
Basically, what the insect had to do—we came in between the flowers—is that it stabbed the stool into the middle part of the way down to know the flower honey tube to get the honey.
Darwin said, “Look at the flower, I guess some things have evolved with it.”
It is undoubtedly insects.
I mean, usually it’s all rolled up, but after it stretches straight, it looks like that.
Now you can imagine that if something so valuable as honey cost the plant to produce and attracted many pollinators, then, as in human sexual behavior, people might begin to deceive each other.
They might say, “I have some honey.
This is a plant.
This plant is loved by insects in South Africa. They evolved from long mouths to obtain the honey of the bottom.
He is an imitator.
This plant imitates the previous plant.
There was a fly with a long-haired mouse, which did not get any honey from the counterfeiters, because the counterfeiters did not give it any honey, and thought it could be obtained.
So, not only did the flies not get honey from the fake plants, but -- if you look very closely at the top of the head, you would see there some pollen that would be spread to other plants, if no botanist came to stick it on a blue card.
(Laughter) This lie has spread throughout the plant kingdom.
This flower with black spots: They may seem like black spots to us, but I tell you, for the male insects of the appropriate species, it looks like two very sexy females.
(Laughter) When the insect arrives and lands on it, immerse itself in the pollen, of course, the pollen will be taken by it to other plants, if you look at the images of the scanned electron microscope that each family should have, you can see actually there some patterns, three-dimensional patterns.
It even makes insects feel comfortable and look good.
These electronic microscope images—a flower-flower disguised as an insect—you can see for our eyes that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures, while insects may perceive very different textures.
This flower has evolved to be able to mimic the metal glossy surface seen in some shellfish.
You can see this surface under a scan electron microscope — which is very different from the other surfaces we’ve seen.
Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even if it looks like an insect.
I mean, I think it looks like some kind of flying animal or beast.
A wonderful and magical thing.
This is the point of its intelligence; it is called the black thunderstone.
I think it is sometimes cunning.
For the suitable species of bees, this looks like another very aggressive bee, which will fly over with its head and hit it many times and try to get rid of it, of course, which will get it stuck in pollen.
Another thing it does is that the plant imitates a different kind of insect-loved food.
But actually nothing.
So it’s cheating on two levels – incredible.
(Laughter) We see the part of Ilan, which has an intense smell.
I actually smelled it before.
These flowers don’t really need to be so beautiful.
They spread a wonderful smell that attracts any interested insects.
The flowers do not smell good.
The flower actually smells very unpleasant to mention again, which has evolved and it looks like rotting meat.
The flies liked it.
The flies flew in and helped it pollinate.
This is white star potato, also known as dead seafood.
I don’t know what a dead horse smells like, but this flower may smell very similar.
It is so terrible.
The green-headed flies are not forbidden.
Fly into it, fly into it.
At the top of the egg, it is thought that it is a very good piece of rotting meat, not realizing that there is no food here, these eggs will die here, but at the same time this plant will benefit, because the hard hair loosened the flies disappeared, pollinated to another flower — so wonderful.
This is a potato plant, European potatoes, and leafy arachnids, known in this country as longevity grass.
I filmed this last week in Dorset.
The guy heated up about 15 degrees higher than the ambient temperature — incredible.
If you look inside it, behind the carnivora is something a bit like a dam, with flies attracted to heat—these are boiling volatile chemicals, small insects—they are trapped under that container.
They drank sweet honey and then became a little dull.
At night they were covered with pollen, sprinkled on top of them, and then the hard hair we saw on top became dull, allowing these little insects to escape—it was unbelievable.
If you think it’s incredible, this one is my favorite.
This is spring green.
Everyone who comes from Brazil should know this plant.
This is the most magical thing.
Its lilies are about one foot long.
It has a capacity that no other plant, as I know, possesses, and when it flourishes -- it's in the middle of the oak -- for about two days, it produces a degree of metabolic change somewhat similar to that of mammals.
It does not have starch, which is the food of the plant, it has something very similar to brown fat to burn fat at the rate of burning it, carried out metabolism, about at the rate of a puppy.
By weight ratio, it’s twice the energy output of the bee – absolutely amazing.
He also did something unusual.
Not only will it heat up to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Fahrenheit for two days, but it will also keep the temperature steady.
There is a temperature regulation mechanism used to maintain constant temperature.
Why do you do that? I heard you ask.
You don’t know that some shellfish like to mate at this temperature.
They went in, full of pollen.
Plants fill them with pollen, let them go and pollinate.
What a wonderful thing.
Now we think most pollinators are insects, but in fact in the tropics, many birds and butterflies are also pollinated.
Many tropical flowers are red, which is because butterflies and birds are similar to us, and we think they can very well see red.
But if you look at the spectrum, the birds and us, we see red, green and blue in this spectrum.
Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet rays, and they can see a variety of bright ultraviolet rays.
There are colours behind it.
“Would it be bad if we could see those colors,” I heard you ask.
Yes, we can see it.
What do insects see?
Last week I took pictures of these desert lions, half-day flowers, in Dorset.
As we have seen, these are small yellow flowers, and these are small yellow flowers everywhere.
In the visible light it looks like this.
Removing the red looks like this.
Most bees do not perceive red.
Then I put the ultraviolet filter in front of my camera for a long time exposure to a particular frequency of ultraviolet light, and I got this photo.
It looks like a real wonderful target.
Now we don’t know what the bees see, and when I call it red, you know what I’m looking at.
We can’t know what’s going on in it, whether it’s insects or other human brains.
But the contrast looks probably like this. Outstanding from the background.
This is another small flower -- located in different ultraviolet frequency ranges, with different filters to match different pollinators.
It probably looks like that.
To avoid you thinking that all the yellow flowers have this attribute -- no damage to the flower during the shooting; just put it on a tripod, not remove it -- in ultraviolet light, look at this.
This can serve as the basis of sunscreen, because sunscreen works by absorbing ultraviolet light.
Therefore, chemicals may be useful.
Finally, it’s a nighttime perfume that Norwegian Björn Rorslett sent me – a wonderful hidden pattern.
I like this hidden way.
I think it’s very poetic.These photos were taken with ultraviolet filters, the primary use of which was used by astronomers to photograph Venus—in fact, the clouds on Venus.
This is the main purpose of this filter.
Of course, Venus is the god of love and fertility, this is the story of flowers.
Just as flowers have spent so much effort trying to attract pollinators to accept their invitations, they have also succeeded in believing that they contain a rich content We send flowers to each other at birth and death, especially at a wedding, just in this moment when you think of it, genetic material is migrating from one organism to another.
very thankful .

On July 26, the Chongqing City Development and Reform Commission that the city has so far withdrawn 4404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In this year's 53-year-old Li, who received an interview with a Chinese reporter, said that grandparents were fishing in the Long River, and since the age of 11 they followed their father to fish, shake a small boat, headed along the Long River, went up to Chongqing Liangping, and lived a long life, each time they left home was ten days and a half months, relying on fishing to maintain family life.
But since 1997, as the rural population gradually flows to the towns, the number of people in the towns is increasing, and the environmental pollution is also becoming more serious.
Long River has built paper mills, chemical factories, farms, and also polluted river water.
In 2007 and 2008, the river was transformed into a smog.
“The scales caught are all black, and black inside after they are cut.”
Li said that fishing is becoming increasingly difficult after river water pollution.
The local government has begun to vigorously control the pollution of the dragon river, including cleaning, cruising rivers, and water resource management.
Li also retreated from fishing and converted production, becoming a member of the cruise fleet, protecting aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, the Chongqing City Aquatic Biological Conservation Area and the relevant waters of the main urban area have been fully banned.
According to the Chongqing City Development and Reform Commission data, to date, Chongqing City has accumulated 3,403 fishing vessels and has signed a withdrawal agreement fishing vessels 4,643 vessels, respectively accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks.
4404 fishermen have been withdrawn, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people that have been withdrawn, 4,267 people have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have withdrawn.
The pension insurance covered 2691 people, accounting for 61.10% of retired fishermen.
The next step, Chongqing City will carry out special repair actions in depth, accelerate the repair of the repair of the cleanup project of the Yangtze River dry stream coastline utilization, complete a new round of the repair of the landfill census of the Yangtze River into the river and carry out the corresponding repair actions, basically complete the repair task of "three phosphorus" (referring to the phosphorus mine, phosphorus chemical and phosphorus reservoir) and the repair work of small hydroelectric cleaning, promote the special operation for forestry and greening on the two sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the illegal landfill of the Yangtze River dry stream and the special repair results of the illegal mining of sand, and deepen the prohibition of the Yangtze River stream.
Israel Strengthens Precautionary Control Against Repeated Epidemics
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: The Daily Telegraph Author: Wang Shui Responsibility Editor: Wang Shui
Israel strengthens prevention against repeated outbreaks
In the early days of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Israeli preventive measures were effective.
However, with the gradual removal of preventive measures and the recent increase in the number of confirmed new coronavirus in Israel, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen preventive control of the outbreak.
On February 28, the first case of coronavirus confirmed in Israel, with the aim of rapidly closing all entrance and exit ports, suspending unnecessary industries, switching schools to online teaching, restricting public transport and unnecessary social activities, blocking severe cities, joining military police to maintain preventive control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of confirmed new cases of coronavirus in Israel fell to a single-digit by one day.
With the outbreak being controlled, Israeli preventive measures have been fully unlocked, and since June, the number of new confirmed coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic has accelerated.
Recently, there were eight daily new cases in Israel with more than 1,500 people, up to 916 cases as of July 25th.
As of July 25, 5,9745 cases have been confirmed in Israel, with 448 deaths.
Faced with the rapid recurrence of the outbreak, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen its preventive control.
On July 6, after the confirmed number of cases broke 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that the passengers in each bus can not exceed 20 people.
On the 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "closure of the city" on weekends, and stipulated the implementation of the "closure of the city" between 17 a.m. and 5 a.m. every Friday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets, pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, rallies of more than 10 people will be prohibited at all dates and times, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be prohibited, and only outsourcing services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the severity of the outbreak and have not been able to work with the government to fight the outbreak.
Following the repeated outbreak in Israel, many people marched out in the streets for government precautions affecting their economic interests.
Tens of thousands of people marched in Tel Aviv on July 11 to argue that anti-epidemic policies affect the economy.
Thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on the evening of the 21st, protesting that Prime Minister Netanyahu has imposed precautionary measures such as a ban on restaurants and cafés without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the rules of wearing masks,ining a two-metre safe social distance, in order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their cheeks or hang on their wrists.
During the recurring outbreak, the school was the disaster zone of the spread of the new coronavirus, and according to reporters recently visited the kindergarten found that the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks according to the government's requirements, nor did they maintain a two-meter safe social distance, buried a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Ely Waksman, a member of the National Security Council’s anti-epidemic advisory panel, said Israel was heading towards a “dangerous situation,” pointing out that Israel’s current measures to prevent the epidemic were not sufficient, and that all recreational, recreational and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waksman said that Israel lacks a comprehensive plan to combat the epidemic, and that parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, agree on the issue of combating the epidemic and formulate clear steps for restrictive measures, including those related to the various sectors.

Ningxian farmer Wu Feng Feng hardly cared for his old companion, two people in the car, from 20 miles away from the house, to the Liang Cloud Cultural Garden.
Despite the two years of leg discomfort, the 77-year-old Di Tianfu still expects to "go here three-five-minute, over play addiction."
This is an unobtrusive yard in the original state district of Solidary City, unlike the general farm houses, the courtyard is often spoken of longing Qin cavities, and there are beautiful pellets, stamps, traditional Qin cavities, eyebrows and so on.
The owner of the house was Liang Cloud, who was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loved painting and singing and began planning the construction of a cultural hall.
With Liangyun Cultural Hall, the cultural life of the villagers became rich.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liang Yuan Cultural Hall, and the tone of Qin's caves has already been passed out.
The chanting section for the villagers is the neighboring villagers of Berli Chan.
She loved Qin from childhood, and now has a small popularity in the local area, as long as there is free time, she will come to the cultural hall to perform for the countrymen.
Recently, Blythe has also played online live broadcasts.
Berli Chan said: “It’s a very happy thing to have a stage where more people can see themselves perform.”
On the stage, the singer at once, the player at once, despite being an amateur amateur, but the enthusiasm does not decrease.
Just like the simple style of the farmhouse, outside Qin's cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-historical culture in the Liang Yuan Cultural Hall came to face.
The hall also collects more than 300 pieces of agricultural tools from different ages, traditional and hand-made steam plastics, cutting paper, stamps, leather images and other physical items.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall, which showed the old objects of his collection, old wine pots, triangles, textile lines and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a culture hall?
“Picture is my home craft, and I started learning it at the age of 15.”
Founded in 2012, Liang Yuan Cultural Academy became the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and also the demonstration hall for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in the city of Solidary.
In addition to Liang Yuan Cultural Hall, the original state district of Fukushima City also emerged more than 120 cultural halls, 79 civic performances groups, of which, there are more than 50 cultural halls of a certain scale, such as the Shenyang River Cultural Hall, Wang Yonghua Cultural Hall, Yang Yuan Cultural Hall, etc., covering the towns and streets of the original state district, and more than 5,000 people attended.
These grassroots artists were active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life gets better, traditional culture cannot be dropped down like this.”
"Liu Xiaobo Spy Warfare" again back to "Winning" to watch Liu Xiaobo Liu Xiaobo opponent "shake up" - Xinhua Network
The 40-set spy battle game "Victory" will land in Beijing on July 16.
Based on true historical facts, "Victory" is based on the Soviet military archives that have been covered with dust for years and appeared for the first time.
Actor Liu Yonglong, known to the audience with "spy war drama", broke the image in the drama, challenging a rather pleasant "smoking agent".
In recent years, the acts such as "The Masquerade", "The Mask", "The Frog" and others have proved that the spy war type drama has a vigorous vitality.
Unlike previous spy wars, the film looks at the world, extending the story beyond the background to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
With the backdrop of the final phase of the 1944 War of Resistance to Japan, it tells the story of Chinese secret intelligence officer Tang Fei (Liou Yonglong), under the leadership of the secretary of the Chinese underground Party Forest River Provincial Committee and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carrying out the Soviet Far East intelligence agency's "Mudan Ur" strategic operation.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist as a senior spy, the first appearance is a beautiful, high intelligence, mature perfect image.
But in the view of Liu Yonglong, such a person is not suitable for spying, "the spy should be that kind of person that can't be found in the pile, if the appearance is that kind of very nice image, hate everyone should pay attention to you, can still hide?"
Therefore, in "Victory", Liu Yun Long decided to design his master, Dong Fei, as a "smoking agent" with pleasure.
The other side camp in Victory was supported jointly by the Japanese Fukuyama played by Li Li and the police chamber chief Feng Xiaobo played by Li Li.
A south and a north of the two strengths of the play, added to the whole drama many high-profile points of view.
The director used the word "spark" to describe the opponent play of Li Li and Liu Yonglong in the play, "It is absolutely a spark, they are two especially silent, their kind of silence is very impactful to me. Many times their play is "hanging up", for example, we only write half the length of the paper, when I shoot, they can always play."
High-end players do not play each other, the director does not bother, when the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, not only can the character from the perspective of the character to shape the character, but also to the audience to bring more viewing possibilities, said such a play is good enough.
In the drama, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Louis Spy Warfare", the "Mountain City F4" in the Windmills, and the "Wind F4" in the Windmills, as well as three people gathered in the "Win Calculator".
He played as Song Yuan and Zhao Jinnah's Ho Chi Minh and Liu Namyang, this time again as Dong Fei's left arm.
Director Ingfi introduced, "These two people have no inferiority, they only followed up in that era, that environment."
Liu Yonglong also proposed, "We want to have a sense of affection. this sense of affection means that people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, our team will also grow."
The two people's course towards the end of the drama was also carefully designed by Liu Yonglong, and he is confident that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.
(Reporters from Chongqing)
4 students drowned dead in Inner Mongolia flag Official: the incident ringed the alarm.
On July 26 (reporter Li Eiping) on the evening of the 25th, reporters from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of Chernobyl city of Chernobyl government learned that four local students died due to accidental drowning.
At 15:50 a.m. on July 24, the 110th public security Bureau received a report saying that there were six high school students drowning.
After the police took over, the local civilian police first rushed to the scene, rescued 2 students on the spot, then the local emergency bureau, water and water bureau and other units followed up to the scene, taking part in the rescue.
It is that the rescue site mobilized more than 80 people from the public security police, forest police, fire and medical services, sent three rubber boats to the surrounding waters and hired a professional rescue team to arrive at the site, and conducted underwater search through sonar detection.
The local rescue personnel found the first student killed at 6:40 on July 25, the second student killed at 11:30 on July 25, the third student killed at 12:40 on July 25, the last student killed at 13:34 on July 25, the four above were rescued on the shore, and the local 120 emergency rescue centers identified no signs of life.
The official said the drowning incident ringed the alarm clock for the entire society.
At the moment, relevant local government departments are working on some of the knowledge about drowning prevention, hoping the tragedy will no longer happen.
Liu Yuan, director of financial affairs and treasury of the Hong Kong Special Region Government, said that the financial markets in Hong Kong remain active and operate orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong’s financial stability and economy.
At an online seminar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce (General Assembly of Canada) on 24 (Toronto time), Liu said that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the "revision wave" and the epidemic of new coronavirus.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and predisposed to the stronger exchange guaranteed level.
The banking system has no obvious signs of a money outflow, but instead, more than $11 billion has been flowing since June.
The bank’s total deposits have also continued to rise in the past few months, with a series of public stock bidding activities on the stock market, and market turnover rising repeatedly.
The new coronavirus outbreak puts pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong’s basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong’s many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, free circulation of information and funds, and a simple low tax system, have made Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
He pointed out that the Government of the Special Region reserves 6 billion Hong Kong dollars in the "Pneumonia Resistance Fund" and will create about 30,000 fixed-term positions in the public and private sector in the next two years, covering different skills and academics.
To support the development of finance and technology, the government has also launched the "thousand people plan", funding local finance and technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial and technology-related business to create 1,000 new jobs, hiring local talents and enriching Hong Kong's finance and technology talent base.
Looking forward to the future, Li said he is optimistic about financial stability and the economy of Hong Kong.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to leverage Hong Kong’s advantages and its position as an international financial centre, international asset and wealth management centre and global offshore yuan business hub to develop and invest in the Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area and nearby regions.
Liu Xiaobo magazine praises China's efforts to fight the epidemic and encourages countries to learn from the experience.
China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion, similar in size to Europe or the United States, at the current stage of the new coronavirus is effectively controlled, without any further spread, has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
For a decade, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, making China much more prepared for the new corona than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
The authors say that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was initially unprepared, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of the virus and shared genomic sequencing data with the international on 11 January 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus, and warned the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published in The Leopard.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, with the country declaring a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research was carried out very quickly and rigorously in May and July, respectively, the results of the progress made in the early trials of the new coronavaccinum developed in China were published on Liu Leu.
China’s experience has shown that investing in national health and research systems to effectively enhance laboratory capacity is very important.
This is the basis for the nation to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are very valuable to learn from.
In addition, China’s experience has shown that strong, high-level and scientifically determined decisions must be made on the basis of strong research to effectively control the new coronavirus outbreak.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the way that is most beneficial to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risks and spread of the new coronavirus, and their suggestions provided the basis for Wuhan’s decision to “closed the city” on January 23; when experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a square hospital, the government quickly made the decision and quickly implemented; at the same time, the widespread involvement of the community and the masses also allowed the outbreak to be quickly and effectively controlled.
In response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

On the afternoon of 25 local time, a small aircraft crashed into the top of a multi-storey residential building in Wessell County, North Wales, Germany, killing three people.
The Duisburg prosecutor's office, the Wessel County Police Department and the City of Wessel's fire department jointly issued a statement that about 14:40 a.m. that day, two small aircraft crashed into a house on a multi-storey roof of a residential roof in Wessel County, killing three people.
It took off the same day from the city of Mar, in the district of Rourke, Northumbria, stopped at the airport in Wessell County, and then crashed into a residential building.
The identity of the dead or for a female resident in the crashed home and two passengers on a small plane.
A two-year-old child in the house was only slightly injured and was safely rescued.
The rest of the residents were not injured in the accident, but the mood has not recovered.
The on-site footage by Deutsche Welle showed that the houses in the accident once erupted from rolling thick smoke, and firefighters can see the house seriously damaged after extinguishing the fire.
The cause of the plane crash is not yet clear.
The Rhine Post, citing police reports, said there were hints that the aircraft had disintegrated before it hit a residential building.
Police said several parts of the crash plane were found at the crash site.
German police are working with the Duisburg prosecutor's office and the German Federal Aviation Accident Investigation Bureau to investigate the cause of the accident.
The reporter learned from the Chinese Consulate General in Düsseldorf that the museum had contacted the local police and fire departments and, according to the scene, no Chinese citizens were among the victims.
Singapore's Ministry of Health announced on Monday that as of 12 a.m., Singapore added 481 new confirmed coronavirus cases, a cumulative confirmed 50369 cases, and a cumulative 27 deaths.
The data show that of the new confirmed cases, five were local community cases, four were input cases, and the rest were foreign workers living in private dormitories.
Singapore’s Ministry of Health says 98% of new confirmed cases are related to known infections.
There are still 173 new coronavirus patients being treated in hospitals, most of whom are stable or improved, and no one is in a serious care room.
In addition, 4,648 people were isolated from community facilities.
The vast majority of newly infected people in Singapore are foreign workers.
According to statistics, 200,000 foreign workers in Singapore live in 43 foreign labor-specific dormitories, and about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of dormitories.
Singapore’s cross-sector work group said on Monday that the government is stepping up testing for the last few private dormitories for foreign workers with high rates of new coronavirus.
The vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work after they have completed the inspection of all the private dorms, but they will still have to undergo regular coronary inspections.
The director of "Happy As Will" enters the King's Prize - New China Network
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official nomination list for the King's Prize.
The director's first real-life theme film, "Happy as intention", successfully entered the award of the festival, while the film officially released the first poster.
Poster for one side.
The film "Happy As It Wills" is the director's first reality-themed work, and also his second relationship with the King's Prize.
The film tells a story: a comedy director suddenly wondered, returning to his northeast rural home, hoping to shoot how the family's birthday into an art movie, which resulted in a series of accidents.
The family members who gathered for filming completed the final party.
In the film poster released today, one member of the family — “Third Uncle” Wang Shishun — sits in the center of the picture smoking a cigarette, with the background covered in silver-dressed black northeastern land, the prospect is the red candlestick that Chinese must hang over the year.
Symbolizing the celebration and unification of the red lantern cage and the lonely Wang Shishun formed a huge contrast, which also seems to reveal the complexity and curvature of this large family relationship.
It is that in the film, in addition to "Third Uncle" Wang Shishun's daughter is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the play is completed by the real director's family, the film's experimental audio-visual style, breaks the boundaries of drama and real, and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to the director, the creation of "Happy as He intends" originated from "an intention", the family suddenly changed during the shooting, so that the original shooting plan had to change, the life without a script was finally recorded as a movie, but released the tension beyond the design.
How does director Deng Xiaoping face this "God's intention", and how can we continue to meet the changes brought by this God's intention?
There is no doubt that Happy is full of experimental, almost amateur lineup and innovative audiovisual style that transforms life in front of the camera into a movie, under the real picture package, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their family from the family presented in the film, with the end of this family party in the film, arouses a series of thoughts.

Batch Tchokun post, row of long survivors and a soldier standing.
In this place where the average annual temperature is down a dozen degrees, a row of simple camps standing in the mountainside, campgrounds not far away with a national flag floating, soldiers daily in the wind, while regularly going to higher altitude patrol.
The warriors climbed the steep rocks, using their hands and feet.
At the end of July, it is the time when the grass is blooming in the low-altitude areas, and in Baja Tse-Kun, there is only a relatively dense green in the crater behind the camp.
The warrior, who has been staying at the post for six years, said that this is their back garden, and only in August every year can see the green grass slowly grow, shortly afterwards, all yellowed and covered with snow.
The walking patrol may take about 9 hours.
In the harsh highlands, the soldiers who reside here are constantly accompanied by snow mountains and glaciers, and they also regularly patrol mountains at higher altitudes.
Recently, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, under the guidance of instructor Liang Yuan, went on patrol again.
Each fighter weighs about 30 kilograms and advances to the target in the early morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled, and his comrades had emergency relief.
In addition to patrol missions, the fighters at the Batuchong poste were given daily tactical and physical training.
The time passed minute by second, the altitude continued to rise, the oxygen content was getting lower and the physical effort continued to be exhausted, these factors tested the will of the patrols.
They bitten their teeth and followed through several crumbling points, across several difficult beaches.
At about six o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrols, they took their own dry food, sat on the ground at more than 5,700 meters above sea level, accompanied by rain and snow, and supplemented with food.
The fighters at the Batuchong post had tactical and physical training.
During the rest, they will play cards together, and the loser will be able to undertake both entertainment and exercise.
After a brief break in the cold wind, they climbed up the patrol target position, raised the national flag on the mountainside, and solemnly swore.
Behind them is the Snow Mountain, in front of them are dozens of kilometers of uninhabited areas, they are the safest guard of the gate.
Beijing consumption season resumed - New China Network
Beijing has resumed its activities in accordance with the principles of "comprehensively restart, focus planning, orderly advancement, and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million consumer coupons were issued, including 1 million online dining shopping coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers can receive in the app.
Liu Maying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, presented at the press conference held on the 25th, that after the resumption of the consumption season, on the basis ofining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer card cards, the company's allocation was further reduced.
From the beginning of August, the current 1:1 allocation of government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2:1, for example, if the original consumer receives a package to the store after consumption, if you can enjoy 120 yuan, in which the government subsidies 60 yuan, enterprises give profits 60 yuan; after adjustment, the government subsidies 80 yuan, enterprises give profits 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize 5G consumption on traffic and terminals, further promoting Beijing's 5G new infrastructure and 5G new consumption.
Chen Mao said Hong Kong's economy was hit again due to the outbreak of the epidemic.
Chinese news agency Hong Kong, July 26, the head of the finance department of the Hong Kong special district government Chen Moobo said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of new coronavirus epidemic shock, the commercial exchanges and economic activities that had initially slightly recovered were also hit.
The special district government once again called on large and small owners to reduce rent and spend time with retailers, grocers and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Mobo published an article on the Internet that day entitled "The Path of Harsh Recovery".
He said that the recent number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus in Hong Kong is high, the situation is severe, affecting social livelihoods, and also troubling the economy.
In case of recurrence of the outbreak, the first priority is to strictly prevent the entry of individual cases, and to handle and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the outbreak is controlled, the economic activity should be resumed accordingly in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of a new wave of epidemic shock, commercial exchanges and economic activity that had seen a slight recovery were also hit.
For the business community, social responsibility is equally important in addition to the spirit of contracts, especially for those groups that receive large government subsidies under the Employment Insurance Scheme.
He noted that the economic situation in Hong Kong remained severe in the second quarter of this year, but the trend of contraction appeared to be slightly slower.
In terms of exports, he believes the situation in the outskirts of Hong Kong remains severe.
The history of Hong Kong’s development over the last few decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
A winter morning a few years ago, in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I was driving to work, I found the city overwhelmed by fog.
I drive there almost every day, but this time it was unusual, I had never seen such a sight before.
Johannesburg is famous for its distinctively beautiful horizon, but it was hardly visible that morning.
Soon I realized that what I was seeing was the serious fog caused by air pollution.
The contrast between the beautiful environment I knew in the old days and the horizon covered by fog at the moment, flooded in my heart.
I fear it is likely that the once coloured beauty of the sunset will be swallowed by the dark fog.
At that moment, I felt a strong impulse, wanting to do something, but I didn’t know what to do.
The only thing I know is that I can’t look like that.
The biggest challenge is that I don’t know environmental science, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.
I’m a computer engineer, and I’m very sure I can’t use encoding to solve the problem of air pollution.
(Laughter) In what capacity will I solve this problem?
I am just a small town.
In the years that followed, I learned an important lesson, and if we want a better future, we should all keep this lesson in mind.
Even if you are not an expert in a particular area, your expertise may include ways to solve problems in that area.
Sometimes, the unique perspective you hold can inspire unconventional thinking and thus correct the situation, but you need to dare to try.
Only then can you know the outcome.
What I knew at the time was that if I wanted to try to change, I had to have enough knowledge of pollution first, so I did back a student.
I did some basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world’s biggest environmental health risk.
In 2012, 14% of worldwide deaths were caused by air pollution in homes and surroundings, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
Every year, air pollution causes more deaths than malaria and AIDS.
In Africa, insecure health conditions caused by premature deaths, or child malnutrition caused by deaths, appear impotent in the face of air pollution, and it also brings huge economic costs: According to statistics of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, related spending in 2013 exceeded $400 billion.
In my work, I’ve explored AI’s cutting-edge technological achievements, including the synergies between humans and machines, finding valuable grounding points and helping us make better decisions.
When I think about air pollution again, things become clear about how to control air pollution, and we need to look for better ways to make better decisions considering the vastness of the problem, collaboration is very necessary.
So I decided to meet some people who work in this field.
I started conversations with officials in Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, I also joined the local scientific community, and I also made some calls to people who were completely unfamiliar but relevant.
These experiences I started to intervene helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the issue.
It also helped me avoid the trap that people in my line sometimes fall into when they try to innovate: fast adopting a technology before they really master the problem.
I started thinking, what can I do to improve this situation?
I began to ask myself how to effectively combine my knowledge in software engineering and artificial intelligence with the professional skills of the people I contacted.
I want to create an online air quality management platform to reveal future pollution trends and make relevant predictions to judge the possible outcomes.
I am convinced that my idea can be a realistic solution, but also faced with uncertainty, I cannot guarantee it will succeed.
What I have is a specific set of engineering skills, only the skills I have gained from my work. (laughs) Of course, for those who have been working in the field of air pollution for years, my skills are new.
I gradually realized that sometimes a new perspective, a new combination of skills, can give rise to something outstanding.
Our willpower and imagination is a light that guides us to overcome obstacles and open a new chapter.
I gained a deeper understanding of air pollution and found data on air pollution over the past decade, as well as weather data from Johannesburg and the surrounding area. Then, with colleagues in South Africa and China, I created a system to support air quality resolution and uploaded it to the cloud.
The software is able to analyze historical and real-time data to reveal pollution trends that change over time and space.
We then use new machine learning technologies to predict future pollution days in advance.
This means residents can make better decisions about their daily schedules and where they will settle with their families.
We can anticipate adverse pollution events in advance, identify serious pollution sources, and allow relevant authorities to give instructions to adjust their business activities.
By assisting scenario planning, urban planners can also make better decisions on how to expand infrastructure work, such as housing in industrial areas.
We’ve built a cutting-edge pilot of the technology, running for 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.
Our expected results have been verified.The predictions we showed showed close correlation with the data we gathered in the field.
Through our management, we introduced the world’s leading state-of-the-art instruments to predict the quality of the atmosphere, with unprecedented resolution and accuracy, so that the recent winter morning in which I entered the city was beneficial.
So the focus is: What if I didn’t study the problem of air pollution in depth?
What if I don’t care about the country’s environment, but hope that some places and some others will take care of these things?
What I’ve learned from this is that when working hard for a business we all believe is important to focus on the possibilities of success and consider the consequences of not taking action.
We should not be distracted by opposition and resistance, it should inspire us to go further.
So no matter where you are in the world, the next time you find that some kind of curiosity you are born with is aroused, and it’s about what you’re thinking about, you have some crazy or brave ideas, even if that’s not your field of expertise, ask yourself: Why not try it?
Why not go straight to solve the problem? do your best in your own way?
You may get an unexpected pleasure.
Thanks to everyone.
and applause
Taiwan's largest earthquake this year in eastern seas
China News Agency Taipei July 26th in the eastern seas of Taiwan on the 26th at 20:52 a Richter magnitude 6.1 earthquake occurred, the greatest earthquake magnitude 4 grade, the whole of Taiwan has tremors, is the largest earthquake of this year.
Taiwan Meteorological Department, the earthquake was located in the south-east of Yilan county government 86.5 km, that is, the east of Taiwan sea area, the earthquake source depth of 53 km.
The Chinese earthquake network estimated the earthquake to be of magnitude 5.5.
The largest earthquake level across Taiwan is: Firenze county 4 level, Iilan county, Taiwan county, South China county, Yunnan county 3 level, and other county cities measure 1 to 2 levels of earthquake.
The Taiwan meteorological department pointed out that this earthquake is the largest since Taiwan this year, belonging to the hidden belt earthquake of the border of the plate, in which the earthquake has often occurred in the past, and has been more active since this year.
In the coming week, there will be no further quakes of magnitude 4 or greater.
Many people think driving is something only those who can see can do.
Blind people want to drive a car safely alone until now, and was also considered an impossible task.
Hello everyone, my name is Dennis Hunt, and we built a car designed for people with visual impairments for the freedom and independence of the blind.
Before I talk about this blind car, let me briefly talk about another project I’ve done before called the U.S. Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Programme’s City Challenge.
It’s about building a mechanical car that can drive itself.
You press the Start button and no longer touch anything, and it can also reach its destination completely automatically.
In the 2007 Challenge, our team won $500,000 to get the third place in the race.
Around that time, the National Blind Association, or the Blind Association, challenged the design team about who could design a car that would allow the blind to drive safely independently.
We decided to try it, because we thought, oh, how hard this would go.
We already have an automated car.
We just let the blind man drive inside, and that’s not over, right?
(Laughter) But we are mistaken and unreliable.
What the Blind Society wants is not a car that can carry blind people, but a car that the blind can take the initiative to make choices and drive.
So we had to give up everything we had to start from the beginning.
To test this crazy idea, we designed a prototype of a small sandy car to test its feasibility.
In the summer of 2009, we invited many blind young people across the country and gave them a second chance to ride the car.
It was definitely a cool experience.
But the problem with the car is that it’s designed to only allow blind people to drive in very limited environments, like a closed parking lot—even on roads fitted with red traffic beams.
So with this success, we decided to take the next important step, making a real car that can really drive on the road.
How did it work?
Well, this is a relatively complicated system, but let me explain it, to simplify it.
We have three stages.
We have the induction phase, the computational phase, and the non-visual interface.
The driver is obviously invisible, so the system must be able to sense the surrounding environment and collect data for the driver.
For this, we use the initial measurement components.
It measures acceleration, angular acceleration—like the human ear, the inner ear.
I combined this information with the Global Positioning System to predict where the vehicle is.
We also used two cameras to detect the driving path.
We also use three laser distance meters.
Laser scans the environment to detect obstacles—from the front, the back of the vehicle and at the same time any obstacles entering the road, any obstacles around the vehicle.
All the vast amounts of information are then gathered into the computer, and the computer does two things.
First of all, one thing is to process information to understand the surrounding environment—what is the path and what is the obstacle—and transfer that information to the driver.
This system is also very intelligent to calculate the safest driving path.
We can also issue instructions on how to operate the vehicle.
But the question is, how can we transmit information and instructions quickly and accurately enough to the blind to make sure he can drive?
For this purpose, we have designed many different non-visual user interface technologies.
The original three-dimensional piano sound system, vibrating bracelets, voice-control gear, leg belts, and even foot pressure shoes.
But today we’re talking about three of these non-visual user interface technologies.
The first interface is called the driving handle.
This is a pair of gloves, in reference to the nodes it has vibration components, so that you can transmit instructions on how to drive – direction and amplitude.
Another device is called speed tremors.
This wheelchair—in fact, it’s a massage chair.
We dismantle it, and we reorganize the vibration components of different patterns. We let them transmit information about the speed, while also having instructions on how to use the oil doors and brakes.
Here you can see how the computer understands the surrounding environment. Because you can’t see the shake, we actually installed a red light diode on the driver so he can see what’s going on.
This is the injected data, which is transmitted from the sensor to the computer.
So these two devices, driving handles and speed tremors, are very effective.
But the problem is that these are instructions-suggesting devices.
That’s not freedom in the real sense, right?
The computer tells you how to drive – turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake.
I call this a driver problem.
So we’re avoiding command-simplified devices and focusing more on information devices.
A typical example of this non-visual information interface is called an empty map.
Consider this as a blind man’s monitor.
It was a small desk with a lot of holes on it, and the compressed air was removed from it, so that it could be described in images.
So even if you are a blind man, you put your hand on it and you can sense the path and obstacles.
In fact, you can also change the frequency released in the air and possibly the temperature.
This is actually a multi-dimensional user interface.
Here, you can see the camera on both sides of the left and right and how the computer resolves and transmits this information to the empty map.
So, we’re showing a simulation where a blind man is driving with a map.
This program is very helpful in training blind drivers and quickly testing different theories based on different types of non-visual user interfaces.
This is basically how it works.
But this car is a model car, and it won’t go on the road unless it’s proved to be driving as safe, or safer, as today’s cars.
I really believe this will happen.
But is society able to accept this radical idea?
How will we deal with insurance?
How will I issue my driving license?
There are many different barriers behind the technological challenge that we need to address before it really becomes a reality.
Of course, the main purpose of this project was to design a blind-driving car.
But potentially more important than this is the enormous value contained in the by-products in this project.
Sensors can be used to view darkness, rain fog.
And with this new type of interface, we can use these technologies to make them safer vehicles for the visible crowd.
Or for the blind, everyday household appliances - educational facilities, office facilities and application services.
Imagine teachers writing notes on blackboards in the classroom and blind students can also use these non-visual interfaces to understand and read what the teacher wrote.
This is extremely precious.
What I show you today is just the beginning.
very thankful .
and applause
Marinichev said the change in value was influenced by ruble depreciation and epidemics.
He said: “The cost of services is increasing.
As a result of the outbreak, people have begun to spend more time on the Internet.”
Marinichev did not rule out that annual internet prices would rise significantly, saying carriers could provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people’s dissatisfaction with rising prices.
"Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to anti-pest heroes - China Network
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers against the epidemic heroes, the chairman of the Bona Film Industry Group in the winter, director Liu Weiqiang (to the left) in Guangzhou with Zhongnanshan academician, held a symposium exchange on the filming and production of the epidemic-themed film "The Chinese Doctor".
The Bonner Film Industry hopes to pay tribute to all the medical and vaccine workers who are fighting on the front lines of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a gift film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Film Industry is deploying under the arrangements of the Ministry of Public Affairs of China and the National Film Bureau, with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, organizing the movie "China Captain" former teamman to shoot the film "Chinese Doctor", this is a film that reflects the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, the people of the whole country united against the new coronavirus epidemic.
The film focuses on Wuhan's first line of resistance to the epidemic, and will take Wuhan's medical personnel and the municipality's O medical team as a personality background, from a human perspective, using a unique narrative, as well as a highly impactful lens language, to show the touching story of Chinese medical personnel full of dedication and sacrifice in the first line of resistance.
It is understood that the first time of the day of Wuhan disclosure, Bona Company overcame serious difficulties, sent a screening team into the first line of the epidemic, face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers to understand and gather information, has been interviewed including Zhang Nan Shan academician himself, Guangzhou Wuhan first person, Guangdong aid O medical team, as well as Wuhan Kinshasa Hospital, Wuhan Association Hospital, Wuhan University Southern Hospital, Wuhan Center Hospital and other white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, took a large number of valuable first-hand video information.
Zhongnanshan academician also expressed expectations and hopes about the film shooting at this seminar: "I look forward to it, and I hope that you will not only visit some more specialists, but also interview more of the medical personnel who have worked hard on the front line, they are most."
He said that he had previously read “I and my motherland” and “Captain China” and thought the way to tell a big story from an ordinary person’s perspective was good.
“Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China.”
Speaking of the spread of the film, Zhang Nanshan academician said that at present some people abroad like to put the virus on the politized label, he hopes that the film can impress the audience from a human perspective: "This film in addition to China, it is best also to be shown abroad, in a way that the domestic and foreign audience can understand, with a real human spirit to impress the audience."
Zhongnanshan academician also deeply recalled the film of the 1980s "Man to Middle Ages" "Such years have passed, I have been most impressed with the film after the reform and opening up is still "Man to Middle Ages", when doctors and friends outside our country watched crying, if "Chinese Doctors" can play such a role, it would be great. "
Zhongnanshan academician said that if "Chinese Doctor" can bring resonance to foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the symposium exchanges, Zhang Nanjing academician also shared opinions and suggestions on current international outbreak prevention and control, "I believe people will always be smarter than viruses."
Zhongnanshan academician said that although the virus is difficult to predict, but from the primitive society to date, humanity has passed through many difficulties, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, plus the world's medical personnel, even the people have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new coronavirus epidemic, people will not be as passive as before, "the next to pay attention to the two aspects of the work, one is to study how to strengthen the world's cooperation, and the second is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts."

The first red exhibition in Shandong — Shandong first red exhibition — to hear today - Hunan Daily News Network - China Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan client reporter 蒋睿 communicator 肖燕
Guangzhou Red Ship Molding, Guangzhou Mao Zedong Copper Statue, Yuanbuku Flower crafts, Guangzhou Forever Rice Meat ... On July 25, 2020, the Hunan Red Tourism Cultural Festival opened in Guangzhou.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Exhibition in湘潭 will be held at the Qianshan Tourism Consultancy Center.
The exhibition area's red literary products, revolutionary old district special products, etc. are full of lingerie, which prompts tourists from all over the world to make purchases.
"This Red Expo is both a demonstration of the achievements of the red cultural industry in the country, but also an important platform for exhibition units and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore the development path."
The relevant person in charge of the executive committee of the first Red Expo in Shandong introduced that this Red Expo with the theme of "promoting the warmth of red culture as a tweet", the total area of the exhibition is 3000 square meters, and the atmosphere is set, the exhibition area is displayed and the online shopping experience area is set.
Invited to the exhibition of Zhejiang Zhejiang, Guizhou compliance, Shaanxi Yuan and other eight foreign province municipalities, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhejiang, Zhejiang and other provinces, a total of 768 exhibits, including red artifacts, crafts, food specialties, tourist lines, red training courses, red literary products and so on.
The exhibition area will be available until July 29.
As the host of the Red Exhibition,湘潭 exhibition area has highlights.
The exhibition department's head introduced that湘潭 exhibition is divided into the development of red industry and red cultural industries.
The red industrial exhibition area exhibits 31 exhibits of six enterprises such as Huaxiang Shaanxi Steel, Huaxiang Cable, Shu Electric Power, and the red cultural industry development exhibition area exhibits 200 units of red series books, red series food, red series literary products and other 27 units of products.

Japan confirmed new coronavirus cases accumulated more than 30,000 cases - Xinhua Network
According to statistics, 239 new confirmed cases were added in Tokyo on the 26th, more than 200 cases were added on a single day for six consecutive days, and the cumulative number has reached 11214 cases.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were recorded in Osaka, 90 were recorded in Fukuoka County and 80 were recorded in Aikido County.
Telecommunications cyber fraud crime increased by 70% in the first half of the year
According to the information of the Supreme Prosecutor's website, in the first half of this year, the national prosecutor's office prosecuted a total of 5,8101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35%.
In particular, the number of fraud crimes committed by prosecutors and prosecutors represents 43.4% of the total number of fraud crimes committed by prosecutors and prosecutors.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has targeted guidance, and a total of nine of the ten typical cases involved in the prevention and control of epidemics have been released.
From the first half of the prosecutor's office, the number of names involved in fraud crimes, up to national macro-policy, down to people's clothing and housing, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health" fraud, "recruitment intermediary" fraud, "suit loan" fraud, fraud with state subsidies, ethnic assets freezing fraud, etc., continuously "develop new", involving education, medical care, employment, retirement, social insurance, land removal, accurate poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only to the victims to cause economic losses, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network scams break the national, geographical and personal restrictions, with public, cross-border, remote, electronic payment and other characteristics, not specific victim groups are many, and great harm.
For example, there are established specialized companies, renting high-end office buildings, establishing several departments or positions, using legitimate online platforms for advertising, recruitment, training and evaluation of recruiters, using enterprise operating model management, wearing "legal coat", and more confusing.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner, is the responsibility of the prosecutor's office.
In the judicial proceedings, the prosecutor's organs seriously perform their duties, both insisting onining a high-pressure position on fraud crimes, and targetedly refine various law enforcement measures, and promote social governance through the formulation of prosecutor's recommendations.
The prosecutor's office strictly considers the facts of the arrest, prosecution of fraud cases, the closure of evidence, the closure of procedures and the application of laws, based on facts, and the law as the guideline, and does so without fault.
In particular, for telecommunications cyber fraud crimes, focus on the central role of electronic data in the fact determination, and strive to build a chain of evidence that confirms each other between electronic data, verbal evidence, and written certificates.
For instance, in the case of an infection-related fraud handled by the Procuratorate of the Zhejiang province of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the prosecutor's office intervened in advance at the first time, from the case to the conclusion, with only 5 days, reflecting the attitude and determination to deal with the general stability of the social situation.
In the review of arrests and review of prosecution, the attention was paid to the prosecution work of the cases, corrected the leakage of 733 people by the public security organs, corrected the leakage of 1113 people by the public security organs and prosecuted the same perpetrators.
In the first half of the year, the national prosecutor's office issued 298 prosecutor's recommendations on fraud crimes to promote joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep governance.
For example, in the case of communications enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations and other vulnerabilities in telecommunications network supervision found in the case, Guangzhou City Prosecutor's Office, Guangzhou City Prosecutor's Office, Dongguan City Prosecutor's Office, prompted relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the long-term system construction.
Four are to do their utmost to pursue the damage.
The local prosecutors' organs seize important links such as interfering in the investigation, guiding evidence collection, and reviewing prosecution, and urge the investigative organs to actively pursue the funds, cooperate with relevant departments to do well in the pursuit of savings, and strive to reduce the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people to a minimum.
For example, in a case involving 22 sets of random seizures of real estate, in the event that the property may be disposed of in advance in other cases, the suspension letter is initially issued, timely delivered to the relevant courts, and the suspension of the pre-seizure court is recommended to suspend the execution of the property in the case, until the crime facts are established and unified, to make the maximum effort to recover the property in the case and recover the loss of the victim.
The prosecutor reminded everyone that the fraud crime should be very vigilant, do not expect to "fall the pie in the sky", do not think cheap is easy to trust, guard your own "money bag".
Winnipeg Prefecture of Guizhou Province: shrunk apple trees and broaden the road to poverty alleviation.
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yuan Sheng Responsibility Editor: Zhu Yuan Sheng
Economic Daily - China Economic Network reporter walked into the village of Winnipeg County, Wenzhou Province.
On the bright day, the villager Li Yuan Liang grassed in the base, although the face was red, but in the mouth from time to time sang a few small songs.
Winning County, because of the low latitude, high altitude, sufficient lighting, large difference in day and night temperature, the apple produced high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding area has a certain popularity, but also because of the small head, many spots, has not been able to sell a good price, can not form industrial scale.
The town was once a poor town of "Baguan Potato Spring Autumn", with a local poverty rate of 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the crucial period of poverty alleviation and decisive victory, it is imperative to change traditional cultivation habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
After several visits, Chen Supra and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development cannot go the old way anymore.
To this end, the town introduced leading enterprises and modernized apples.
Winning Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. deputy general manager Hu Jianlong in 2015 from Shaanxi came to Zhenya town to research, a glance at the local growing conditions, from 2016 to the local apple tree plantation.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuan Liang to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuan Liang and the couple committed a murmur: "Seeing so many years of apples, I didn't see who planted apples in the village made a fortune."
“The apples that are planted are lower apples, so that the apple tree doesn’t grow too high.”
Li Yuan Lian did not think of the fact that this apple plantation adopted a new method, irrigation water pipes are laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer are poured together into the roots of the trees, and when the fruit is harvested in the autumn, the tractor is directly opened into the fruit garden, and you can pick up the fruit.
At present, the base of Apple has gradually entered the period of abundance, and the market, as Hu Jintao anticipated, Apple is not scared to sell, and is deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has made new changes in Li Yuan Li's life, although it is still in the field, but there are new sources of income.
Li Yuan Lian family has more than 9 acres of land flowed to the Apple base, each year in addition to the land flow fee of the base, there is a profit dividend, the couple usually work in the base, "one can get 80 yuan per day, there is a year of work."
Li Yuan Li told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fees and the work income of the couple, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan, "the food and clothes are not worried, the days of small business have passed."
"At present, the first results have been seen, the annual output of 1 acre of apples is more than 150,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Yuan told reporters that the entire town has currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, only in the Mediterranean village there are 6,000 acres, covering farmers 4056 households, 1,72 million, of which cover 656 households, 2,952 people, the annual wage is more than 6 million yuan, really realized the base is built at the doorstep of the house, work does not need to go outside.
Li Yuan, who is growing in his backpack, has also begun to realize his "wishes".
This year's Lunar Spring Festival, Li Yuanlong bought a off-road car, such as today's car to work, "the house has a dozen acres of land, wait for the next step of Apple base to expand the scale, all flow to them, the income is more ".

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Break the "Greenhouse Effect"
Membrane Separation Technology Helps Break the "Greenhouse Effect"
New type of hybrid base film preparation technology demonstration
Recently, the Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team made significant progress towards the "membrane separation method of capturing carbon dioxide", successfully developed a new type of hybrid base film preparation technology, and greatly improved the performance of membrane material carbon dioxide capture.
The findings have been published on the cover of the International Journal of Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize human-emitted carbon dioxide is the focus of the scientists.
The "film separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gases with the help of membrane materials, with the characteristics of high energy efficiency and simple operation.
How to let the film material "breathe deeply", improve the efficiency of gas separation, is the bottleneck of carbon dioxide capture using the film separation method.
Tianjin University research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to investigate the impact of different solvents on the membrane gas separation performance.
Experimental results have shown that using N-methylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethylmethod.
The hybrid substrate film prepared with this new technology, the carbon dioxide separation performance is close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of such film materials.
“The new technology offers new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.”
Li Liu, a member of Tianjin University’s atmospheric environment and bioenergy team, said: “We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to handle smoke gases and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.”
Before volunteering, first understand what is a professional level.
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning News Author: Yang Xiao Edit: Yang Xiao
Before volunteering, know what is professional.
Each year, students or parents fill up volunteers because they do not understand the terms involved in volunteering, thereby affecting volunteering.
This year, Beijing University of Transportation, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing Postal University, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing Chemical University 5 colleges jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to eliminate the professional grade gap.
What does the professional level difference mean and what is its importance in volunteering?
There are three types of professional distribution rules.
Experts remind that before filling out the volunteer, it is necessary to read the "Admission Regulations" of the school, understand the university's admission rules, including the ratio of adjustment, the rules of professional distribution, etc.
Professional distribution rules, refers to the college adjustment, for professional admission mainly have professional priority, score priority, professional level difference three ways.
The specific methods used by the university will be specified in the Admission Statutes.
But there are also some universities' admission principles that the total score is priority, and there is no grade difference between the professions.
That is to say, the applicants in the scope of admission are ranked according to the total score, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, see if the second professional volunteer admission score line is reached, with such a push until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between the various professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional level difference" is the university in the arrangement of candidate specialization, according to one or several score values published in the registration regulations, to determine the selection of different professional volunteer candidates for admission, this score is "professional level difference".
That is, the school's score difference in the admission of candidates first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer, the difference between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
As an example.
Suppose that the student applied to a university, examined 560 points, its professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, A university's professional admission practices the method of professional grade difference, the grade difference is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the course of professional assignment, if the first professional volunteer of Xiaoming meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" specialty; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be deducted from 2 points, according to the score of 558 points with the first professional volunteer to apply for the "international trade" candidate ranking, determine whether it meets the professional admission requirements; if it is still not met, the score will be deducted from 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automation" admission; if it is still not met, the score will be deducted from 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the fourth professional admission, if the subsequent professional still cannot meet its professional volunteer, will no longer be reduced to such push.
Different university level differences.
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, now many universities have eliminated the professional level gap, but this year some universities have also retained this method, from the "Enrollment Charter" published by various schools, this year mainly more than 20 universities have set the professional level gap.
For example, Sichuan University of Agriculture, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Chengdu University of Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangsu University of Medicine, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric University, Chengdu University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Industry, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy and so on.
Among these colleges, the professional grades set by each university are different.
Some universities have grade differences in each specialty, such as the University of Ningxia, the file has been submitted to the candidate of the school, according to the candidate's completion of professional volunteers in the order of reducing 1 minute after admissions by score.
And some universities have different professional level differences between different specialties.
For example, the total score of the professional volunteer level difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, the other professional volunteers are not ranked, are considered parallel volunteers, and the other professional volunteers and regulators are 1 point.
When filling out the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admissions policy of the schools, see if there is no professional grade difference, the form of the grade difference is what, in the full consideration of the scores, at the same time, also rational analysis of the chosen schools and professions, if the university in the admissions charter clearly take the grade difference method for admission, candidates in the selection of specialties, to pay attention to the gradients between the specialties, improve the admission rates.

Belgium 3-Year-Old Girl Died of New Coronavirus Infection
The Belgian health department said on Thursday that a 3-year-old girl died of a new coronavirus infection, the country's youngest new coronavirus patient.
Belgian health department spokesman Boudwin Cartier said the girl had other serious illnesses before being infected with the new coronavirus; in addition to the girl, a young 18-year-old recently died of the new coronavirus infection.
Cartier said 85 percent of newly-confirmed coronavirus in Belgium last week were under the age of 60.
He warned healthy, younger and older people not to fall down.
“While young people die from a new coronavirus infection is relatively rare, no one is immune now.”
Last week, newly confirmed coronavirus cases in Belgium increased by 89% compared to the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from coronavirus infection, up from a daily average of 1.7 in the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, new coronavirus infection in the Belgian population ranks "top" in Europe.
Belgium has more than 11 million inhabitants.
The latest data showed that in Belgium there were a total of 6,4847 people infected with the new coronavirus.
Carter warned earlier this week that action would have to be taken before the snowballs rolled bigger and eventually caused a “crash.”
To curb the epidemic’s recurrence, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced on 23rd that the rules on people wearing masks in public places would be tightened, and a plan to further lift restrictive measures in August would also be suspended.

The Director of the Office of Commerce and Economic Development of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Region, Chen Tian Huang, said on 25 July that all APEC member economies should act together to jointly resist the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations established by the World Trade Organization.
The statement was made during the video conference of trade ministers to combat the new coronavirus outbreak held by the APEC on the 25th.
At the meeting, Ministers exchanged views on the APEC response to the epidemic of new coronavirus and substantive plans to promote the economic recovery in the region.
The public health and economic crisis triggered by the outbreak has unprecedented far-reaching impacts on society and the economy.
“We are in a double battle, and we must first defeat the epidemic to save the economy.
We need to make it clear that the virus is our common enemy, and that cooperation can only win, but only fail.”
Churchill said the series of trade restrictions triggered by the new coronavirus outbreak did not help control the outbreak.
Trade is the key good way to solve current problems and should not be seen as where the problem is.
He condemns all policy measures that discriminate and differentiate, and urges all economies to keep borders open at this critical moment, to maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains, and to avoid setting up trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies.

In response to the US closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston, China announced on Friday the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu.
On Saturday, the consular emblem was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glassed car rushed away from the consulate in the rumor of passers.
On Sunday, many people gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate to take photos, and those who have not come have also come to look out because of curiosity.
Reporters also went to observe near the Consulate of the United States of China in Chengdu, and that the curious people were uninterrupted, and there were many parents who took their children to take a walk to see the consulate, take photos of the building, or take a selfie.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police sometimes “corrected” people’s behavior, and they seemed not to allow any outcry to occur: a woman had just begun to sing the red song and was stopped, and a guard had confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to pull a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shout a slogan in support of China.
The consulate opened in 1985, covering all consular affairs in southwestern China, especially in the Tibetan Autonomous Region.
The Chinese government’s response to the U.S. is relatively restrained: many Chinese online ask the government to close the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, but officials simply say that “the closure of the U.S. consulate is a necessary and legitimate response to U.S. unreasonable behavior.”
Currently, in addition to Chengdu, the United States in China also has a consulate in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong.
