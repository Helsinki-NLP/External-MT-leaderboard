Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils cannot in principle, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals were either a brownish-brown color on the top and pale or cardenoid color on the undersides.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.

The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for flight but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' view is that, although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult individual, not a young.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual, not the feathers of a bird.

Since then, a woman has been charged with the murder of her son in the sheriff's court in Edinburgh.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised given that her image has been published in many media.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
"Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish pictures of suspects or something else", observed Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee.
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, whose overall remit is prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until the indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will relate to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.

Science journal published on Thursday reports the creation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved over only two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and the domesticated cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be molded into all kinds of shapes. It can be cast into tiny shapes.
It can be processed into a thin wire, which can be spun or braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illustrated (illuminated) manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice varies depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
pH level denotes the amount of hydrogen ion (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into the ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of wrap.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowls in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remains of a sewer system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women shared the same social space.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then returns it down almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and images.
To send a satellite or a telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet in height.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to allow us to travel much easier and faster.
This brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pets) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that each cat does and that prevents it from competing with others.
The lion is the most sociable of all cats, and he lives in large groups known as herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males in pairs, compared with up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troopers behave similarly to wolf or dog troops, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb a tree (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but rather like a sentence full of sharp, shouted words.
The eagle likes to eat small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, if they can. Almost all the animals the eagle hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists think that ocelots track and search for prey by smell, by sniffing out a location on the ground where they have been.
The sharks hunt by blending with their surroundings and then by rushing to their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it migrates across a mountain range or a river or if it migrates to a new island so that it cannot easily return back) it will often find itself in an environment different from the one in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than was previously needed.
The original population has not changed a bit, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like another population.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans breathe in (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide us with coolness.

The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, and they feared nothing but other mosasaurus.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 teeth, razor-sharp, along with an additional set of teeth on a hard jaw, meaning that nothing that got in his way could escape.
We cannot be sure, but it may have had a hand-tied tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasauruses, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be equal to it.
Though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of poop rodent.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to have banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
The ancient Roman meals could not have contained the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted mustard.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to please the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary that was only open to priests.

The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
The majority of the daily life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open shelves overlooking the street.

Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as the archipel in geographical descriptions because of the group of islands it has.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as ilja formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of Aboriginal grain-producing practices, and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a Qing province of the Empire in 1885.

Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely, the Intihuaatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.

For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide, and 24 mm high.
It is assumed that the dimension ratio of this format is 3:2 (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest ratio in the form of an integer).
Many common formats (say APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly this size.
The rule of thirds that is often abused and often ridiculed is simply a guide that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the picture.
It states that the most striking location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be monitored.

The Bible says: "With the end of the days of the wicked one, the wicked one will be no more".
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, thus posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.

To accept a job with the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) intended for Thomas Edison.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
The most famous of all was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for sixty years between the Han and Yin dynasties.
During this period, there was a fierce warfare between many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in a battle for the throne in the huge palace of Si'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
also after the revolution the occupation was open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, for instead of being class-based, ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Hira on MountNur (Lightness).Hira is a cave in the mountains of the Himalayas.Hira is the name given to the cave in which Muhammad was born.
The cave itself, which has survived various times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

Nothing is visible but the clear, beautiful skies and numerous surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramidal structures that pay homage to the late pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.

The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to retreat to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, at the instigation of a mob of women from the market.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and shouted threats directed at the king and queen.
The ruler ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the royal guard waved the head of a soldier killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the citizens of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime in order to meet most of the costs and interest on the securities that were circulated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The height of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Working Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.

Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself goes by a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it might be said that a motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Yet, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in health care to repair damaged bodies.
Romance contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.

Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.

It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.


Consumption farming is farming that is done to produce enough food just for the farmer and his/her family.
Consuming agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds, native to a given ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The features that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often denote their membership through recognizable and symbolic uses of style, which include fashion, mannerism, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
brutal or wild. Some wild children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of children occurs due to the parents' refusal to accept the serious intellectual and physical shortcomings of the child.
Some children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild.
When fully raised by nonhuman animals, wild children exhibit behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the behaviour of those animals who cared for them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the Scale system is a step forward.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides support to individuals, with help going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Dupping can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of supporter, but also a little human-builder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are an integral part of the software and should review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to perform on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it is happening nonetheless.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a secure home, caring caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
The children's family accommodation should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to pleasure.
andsocialization are cited as important purposes of using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) identified personal engagement and maintained connections as new motivational aspects when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that if you correctly interpret microexpressions, you can tell if a person is lying.
Oliver Sachs, in his work The President's Speech, pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to understand human behavior may be present in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and uncovered.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is the removal from the background of the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination affect the continuous mixing of variations between two funds in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive tract similar to that of a human has difficulty satisfying its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
If left unchecked, the consequences can be serious: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to access were the proteins available in leaves and sponges, but primates like us have a hard time cheating them if they are not cooked.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (anth, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way as chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm that would bring you to a state of consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which causes the man to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and quiet.

Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.

Kundaliniyoga
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures led to the two countries' falling out.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be real, through conflicts of smaller countries that represent the interests of larger military forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.


Trans-oceanic shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most notable, recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to move men and weapons across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.

The first domestication of goats appears to have taken place some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easier access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Goats were kept mostly in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or juveniles, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though early railroads consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed horse-drawn carriages to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.

This became standard practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the car.
In 1767, the first railings made of solid iron were used.

Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
Perfection in bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahaleanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem, and we should put it out.

After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 specimens, now known as the "Danlapp side", were made overnight.
Nixon read this document publicly for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap manuscripts that are known to still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.

Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.

They have feet with hooves and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of open packaging of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term stink bug originates from an ancient acquaintance with stink bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer whale and common whale are species that stay with parents for a long time, adapted to life in a litter or host's home.
The estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged persons.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women were twice as likely to have MS symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that the other couple can be the parent of the child.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method. This method actually governs most scientific research.

The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not just responses to periodic changes in external influences are observed in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free-running rotation, even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled DNA phages with radioactive phosphorus or protein phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells that are affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, and for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal wildlife.
Activities in the field include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
Visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo are examples.
Everyday morning, people leave small rural places by car to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplaces are in the very place they just left.
In this dynamic transport process, they are all somehow connected and support a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this large-carbon economy has moved the biosphere out of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable consistency range; hence traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of the facilities along the way.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are the horse-faced fairies and the water flowers.
(Ester 1:1) "Everything that is in the universe is a part of the universe".
Some people believed he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a local width of six miles.
The Amazon is the source of 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Though the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids of Giza in their size and technical exceptionalism.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were by then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Vatican City is a Vatican city.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, copper, have been known to man since ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of just one or a few of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that these are converted into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloys are actually mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon.
The universe is made up of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less used.
People now text on a computer screen without ever having been near a clipboard.
Can we just wonder what the keyboard will turn into when it finds something new?
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing heavy wagons up a hill, and then the core is cracked again, releasing some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km (43 mi) thick on the near side and 100 km (62 mi) thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar sea, and thicker under the hills.

Content theories are geared toward finding out what moves people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they mature into adults.
These theories study what makes certain people want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two forms of behavior can arise when managers start leading their former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to stay "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything he has done as a team and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones for which local leadership would have no understanding.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
Invisible team is a management team to which each member reports.Invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for applying organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come into play.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesion, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material to make simulation models that help us understand processes in our mind.
Although AI draws a strong connotation of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications, as it is embedded in several home computers and video game application software.
Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
The technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art from sitting in their classroom.
Virtual sharing is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students of the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is redesigned, but the old versions are stored online so that they can serve as an album.

Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through active reaction to materials from the Internet, students can define their views in the context of others' texts, as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and boasts a whole host of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven for the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskogee and beyond.

Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.

The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is arguably the largest island, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or in association with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was widely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Way from Europe to India.
The Sahel is bounded to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all passengers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not just one that looks overpriced).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, hand-grabbed, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that does not mean it is okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badia, and the Spanish traders who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as baguettes, pottery, leather goods, coconuts, and a variety of drangulis, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the Nyaragongo lava flood, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.

The city is also the base from which the climb to the Yiragongo volcano begins, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-bodu (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands due to its relative inaccessibility.
Timbuktu is now a poor town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Henry Louis Gates during the filming of "The Wonder of the African World", on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the state, as it has more Arab than African backgrounds.
National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main attraction of South Africa's National Parks (JANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
Also, consider purchasing a Joker Card, which gives you access to certain South African parks or to all the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering graphite outline of the series of buildings that make up the skyline, which is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kaulon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban area is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that was claimed by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now houses 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer packs.
Buses leave from intercity bus stations (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumtang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
