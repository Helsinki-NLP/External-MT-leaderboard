Hindi lamang ito nagpapatibay na ang ilang mga dinosaur ay may mga balbas, na isang popular na teorya, kundi nagbibigay rin ito ng mga detalye na hindi maibibigay ng fossil sa pangkalahatan, tulad ng kulay at 3D na pagkakasunud-sunod.
Sinasabi ng mga siyentipiko na ang mga balbas ng hayop na ito ay kulay-kape sa itaas at ang ilalim ay paliwanag o kulay-carotene.
Ang natuklasan ay nagbibigay rin ng isang pananaw sa ebolusyon ng mga balbas sa mga ibon.
Dahil ang mga balbas ng mga dinosaur ay walang ganap na nabuo na axis, na tinatawag na "balbas ng nuera", ngunit mayroon silang iba pang mga katangian ng balbas - tulad ng mga putik at mga maliit na putik - ang mga mananaliksik ay nag-isip na ang nuera ay malamang na isang kasunod na ebolusyon ng mga katangian na ito.
Ang istraktura ng mga pakpak ay nagpapahiwatig na hindi sila ginamit sa paglipad kundi para sa pag-iingat ng temperatura o para sa pag-iilaw. Ipinahihiwatig ng mga mananaliksik na bagaman ang buntot na ito ay para sa isang maliit na dinosaur, ang sample ay nagpapakita ng isang matanda na balbas at hindi isang buntot ng katkot.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult bird feathers and not a cockatoo feather.

Carriageways were invented in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the old railway carriages were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than the roads that were considered more rugged at the time.

This became a tradition, but the iron further eroded the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first complete iron bars were introduced.

Everyone participates in the community and uses the transportation system. Everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers inefficient? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic is difficult because you can't predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Sa kabutihang palad, ang mga drayber ay may kinalakasan na kumilos sa isang katumbas na katumbas ng pagkakaisa; sa gayon, ang trapiko ay may katumbas na pagkakaisa, at maaaring ipinahayag sa matematika sa pamamagitan ng pag-aapruba.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships were established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with road infrastructure planning, design and operation.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to bend their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
