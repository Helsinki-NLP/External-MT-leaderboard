Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, inflation was higher than expected in November - an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded after the 2.6% in October, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been expected to reach only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British, and Canadian Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the benchmark interest rate. At its discretion, the interest-rate cut would favor rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment to create an inflation spiral.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the throwback: inflation needs to be “eliminated ” in order to avoid later action.
At 3.3%, the inflation rate reached a record high in Germany in November of 12% year; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6% to 4.1%.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the eurozone.
The MATIF and wheat quotes rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in prices for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world price of crude oil this year rose by 52 percent - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% in 2008 to 2.5%, but it is expected to decline to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts expect an inflation rate of 3 percent for the next 3 months, but estimate the average annual rate of 2.1 percent.
Experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz ’ s number of sympathizers has grown substantially until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while Gallup said that approval for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
Due to the strong determination of the opposition supporters, the difference is clear among party loyal voters: more than two-thirds (71%) are in favour of MSZP for one fifth (20%).
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary obstacle to entry: they come to two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before was the proportion of those who regard the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" so high (41%), while another 46% consider it "rather bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population anticipates a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - considered the Prime Minister's work to be "rather bad than right."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be tackled without a change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% were still in favour of the government and the Heads of Government, today this share is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60% replied that they would participate "with certainty" and a further 20% would vote "probably".
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go to the polls "with certainty", another 15% consider their participation to be "probable". Given these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital.
Turned to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty", the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would amount to as much as 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Auchan at the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the trade triangle in Buda, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has increased by 16 percent again this year, however, price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "davongaloppiert" last December, the inflation was not drastic in percentage terms, compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it is certainly dissuasive for consumers that this year, for which they paid well below 9,000 HUF last year, is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and lively fish remained almost at the previous year ’ s level, but prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop in the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping basket Auchan comparison cut the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping basket by 15 compared to the Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year ’ s cheapest shopping basket and today ’ s most expensive one was 12%, while the increase between last year ’ s cheapest shopping basket and this year ’ s most expensive one was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was 1,206.00 Forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable at the prices at the last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has hit trade badly: it seems that department stores were not quite able to decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unforeseeable.
(If the trader does not plan the speed of a product, it can fall for substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest one, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase; the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office established a cost of more than 30% in the period of 12 months.
So in about beside flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has barely increased by more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to transfer the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden trading triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities are bought from everything, durable foods go over the counter in pallets.
Wednesday morning in all three department stores there were endless snakes at the Kassa, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so many multinationals complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overloading of the personnel - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the control of the infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the Traumatology Department of the János Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The injured of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be performed because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark digit is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA caused infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
If, however, the remedies are dosed too high or used improperly, the well-corresponding bacteria produce antibiotics resistant, which quickly spread in the hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older patients or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the daily illness.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff carries rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are hospitalized, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the containment of the emergence or the spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should examine the patients supplied and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced so frequently.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this examination on the part of the state health insurance company.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate application of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotics and therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, among outpatient or primary patients, microbiological sampling is even more rare.
Gespart is used for disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted by one patient to another by carers.
This is precisely why washing hands or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted through droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in the local hospitals.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are lined up, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately in the financially less well-off hospitals it even occurs that disinfectants are saved, there are few carers, many patients - all factors that favour the development of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less common there, or can be stopped the further spread of the pathogen, where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA to get a grip on infections causes the health insurance companies enormous costs, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - according to published data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death-steering policeman was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with deadly exit, the official report is now available.
The meanwhile resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor influenced by drugs, said Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor ’ s Office on Friday, after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he took control.
The former police chief took his own car to Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the street in an unmarked place.
(According to StVO this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, slowing.)
The pedestrian was injured after he was sent to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebars suffered a shock, then relinquished his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has initiated its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the outset.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, with the aim of providing education, transport and environmental protection for infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects implemented through grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of €150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be devoted to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be channelled into research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
At the meeting also the U-Bahn line 4 was discussed.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary clarified the details of the EU's financing of the railway, the original Treaty and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR and the loan will be provided by the EIB with a period of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks attentively at the Balkan state, which was rarely mentioned before.
What, where, and who buys the EU's still cheapest market, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most desirable pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renner, however, real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimations of Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country was also likely to attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russe has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office space offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter season as well as in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also prospective buyers from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while Russian buyers are mainly present at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties for 50 €100,000, or rundown houses for 5 €15,000, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are decisive for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is made up of businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming more and more expensive due to ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, while real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, there has been an annual price increase of 21% over the past five years.
The price of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian Percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be prepared to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether developed countries are prepared to provide both financial and technological support to developing countries in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol ’ s adjustment fund is to be managed by a 16-member council, probably at the UN ’ s Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the “Piac és Profit ”.
Hungary ’ s Six Percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's commitment to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that by 2020, the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (as measured by 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" would be successful, or not. Indeed, the Union would be prepared to commit itself to a 30% reduction, as far as other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries, are also prepared to fulfil their obligations in every way and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the states that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its then 15 member states.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985 – 87 – a target that the country will fulfil, as can be seen in the Ministry of the Environment press release.
The deployment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be finalised within two years, otherwise it would certainly only enter into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed, international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international UN Scientific Climate Change Committee, awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and increasing the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 ° C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase their popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been downloading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The thumbnails mounted on helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Embassy Unavoidable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Department of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Department of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
Initially, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign missions.
Such publicized propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television commercials, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertise With game
But the army also has to fight against amateur shots, which, in addition to the carefully worked, censored shots, also create it in the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are at most talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos have already been loaded onto the platform from the war locations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "genus" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Amerikas Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier in the context of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means indifferent: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a working conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas mood with tombola or push into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken hold of the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry will be held this year in the Defence Site, but the Ministry staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are given away by fallen soldiers, at the "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFT) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are hitting the strands.
The 4.32 Mio Forint expensive Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The main focus of the festivities is Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFT) held its 4.7 million Forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Judicial Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The hall rent was 1 Mio Forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFT is also invited to attend another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the competent persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT-building was open not only to the guests of the NFT, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia -Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech of the minister, after the dinner there was music for dancing.
At the request of [origo] they said: There was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work and self-government are preparing each for puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference on the end of the year.
According to the press department, approximately 180 guests are expected to be served only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration is expected to be 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply start in the ministry ’ s auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured with 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kick-off.
Since the beginning of János Veres ’ term of office, PM employees have celebrated this every year.
However, there will be no proper party mood - not only because of the official minister's speech, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year reception on 20 January, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry is cancelled this time.
One asks the one hundred guests to the castle Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort the expenses are measured with 1.000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the minister and end with a restrained break.
As reported by the corresponding press offices on [origo] request, there will be neither the Foreign Ministry nor the Ministry of Education a Christmas party.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is organized in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Confederation of Trade Unions form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the decommissioning of work will begin.
Strikes are expected to cause significant traffic obstacles, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 pm.
Details of the strike on Monday will be jointly announced on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
It also establishes a LIGA - MOSZ strike committee, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday onwards, all organizations that have joined the strike will settle the work indefinitely, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to discuss the way forward.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will only take place in the late evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes that will begin on Monday will have to face significant traffic obstacles: the railwaymen are laying down their work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán's societies are standing still.
At the same time, there will be highway blocks in one direction in many places.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes for an indefinite period, others plan a temporary retirement.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was still no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of railway workers VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by train during the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. from the start of operations until 1 p.m. at Budapest Airport, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will settle down the work for four hours, and the teachers ’ union (e.g. the Democratic Teacher Union) have called for 2- and 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally alternately at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Employees, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government takes back the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
Claim three states that access to the early-retirement scheme will be granted to the eligible professions before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the subsidiary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases government risk
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsies and the non-gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which presumably aims at provoking such a conflict, says the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma Left Question to representatives of radical political groupings who have now built their political strategy against the Roma Hungary".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make sensible dialogue impossible, favour limbs, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have seriously damaged Hungary's image abroad, particularly in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the upswing, so that since summer 2007, several "national self-defense" organisations have been established.
"These groupings have in common that they define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly boast about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (civil protection, national defence, administrative protection), with reference to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state itself", it was said.
And again, all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to disguise various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party oppression of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association thus do not merely serve to bypass legal obstacles that might arise in the course of the registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, some ultranationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region "- it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was founded in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass expulsions that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU has taken the events as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is "national protection".
In her opinion a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria was noticeable in the past 17 years, but the state remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have started a fierce debate among the Bulgarian public.
As I have said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Alert Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital said on request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and if risk-changing tendencies are visible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of reallocating the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year gives us fewer such days.
In the EU and in America, too, something else is understood as' holiday '.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Working days are usually ecclesiastical holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15, commemorating the revolution of 1848, and October 23, the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, the foundation of the state is celebrated, on 1 May, the work is celebrated, and on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "postponement of work" has proven itself in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends is, however, that we have to work very well on the Saturday before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be processed, is fixed for many years by the Minister of Labour in its own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
This year, the working regulations are only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from the 24th of December, life will remain in this country, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year ’ s Eve will take time compensation, or the holiday that has been specially cancelled.
Next year, more holidays will fall into the middle of the week or the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-allocations for the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second relocation is related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, Friday, 24 October will have to be processed in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely dedicated to the holidays, after everything will be up and running from the 24th of December, even if New Year ’ s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get - harmless lies that no longer make us realize: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether you are accustomed to these small inconveniences, or if you are better faced with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandable situations consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to align you that someone from the marketing department has called" - says a colleague.
That they missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to do it again by calling the marketing department and confessing that one had forgotten to align the message (that is the less common method).
Usually the thing is dismissed with an apology.
Before getting entangled in embarrassing excuses, one should think about how to prepare one's colleagues for truly unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Loaned something that doesn't belong to you?
There is hardly anything more annoying than using a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the stitcher was still on the desk - this morning it is gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, we should not borrow from colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, do not put envelopes or post it out of the office into your pocket, because it could hit you: none more there, if you need it urgently.
Gossip about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who made with whom, what?
Where and why?
One should not bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of the colleagues if possible everyone to the nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, instead of aligning those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason reported sick?
If you call in the office to report yourself sick, citing tormenting headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unpostable appointments, projects with fixed appointments now have to be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don ’ t play along badly!
If you already know the day before that you will not get it into the office the next day, or that something could happen, so you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Gesumme, Gekicher, Phone
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of colleagues?
Do you unintentionally hear a telephone conversation that you should not have heard?
One should not annoy the colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over their heads), rampling, constant scolding or crumbling.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not ready on time, you have to forget to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, we should not talk about the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
The best way to admit your mistakes is to apologize if others were also affected!
The question of how to correct the mistake, or how to make up for the omitted, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slaps: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should one dress so casual, if it would actually allow the workplace!
Not too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Everyone is right to want to do it - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go the traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody resounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which resounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not pampered us for a long time with quality electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene, are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is "in" again with its guitar beats, the local electropop proves: There are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started playing in Pécs, even in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a tavern doesn't tolerate two pipers - started to walk his own way.
His breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements from jazz, electronics, and pop, was only achieved when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" lined up their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums, and together with Yonderboi, Zagar elected as almost the only trend setter that could also be marketed in the West.
Without doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still travelling with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but besides the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and trends -, the influences of rock 'n' roll are noticeable.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at Millenáris.
A song from the album even made it a radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, which has been broadcasting pop music since the very latest from early to late, successively set the ear to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "shift music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, just as they can only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motif.
The listener ’ s readiness to record works independently of languages and national borders according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. E.g.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. E.g.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us, music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only exists in the unripe changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: if you want to do it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is a soloist and has built up his career in the West.
B. E.g.: We don ’ t really go his way, apart from the fact that you try again and again to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves rather as team players, who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
Initially, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" takes first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a somewhat more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. E.g.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a draughtsman for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why it, what was the guiding principle?
B. E.g.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel choir.
Then came the idea of compiling the choir from talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized as "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you like the song, or did the girls co-design it?
B. E.g.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs "something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came practically immediately and terribly spontaneously.
I remember, I was quite electrified at that time, but the "divas" was already needed.
With my voice alone the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert they had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay ’ s short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing together completely and they are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage behind.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they stood behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
In the number it is also about that one should forget his ego a little, forget who came from where and where on the way, let us simply allow these particular wings to lift us up the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. E.g.: Actually none of the musical creative work, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, on "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or on "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything has joined together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes constantly with the concerts and also now, where I have the album "losgelasssen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraud broker risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Bottomless scammers
For example, his former employee Jerome Kerviel is the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came because of it by almost five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it the same to his colleagues, beyond that was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in good time.
"He is psychically rather weak", was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as Kermany's statements, published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had made profits of EUR 1.6 billion with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he succeeded in earning half a billion euros precisely at the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already first news that so-called Sub ’ Prime ’ mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits and goes on to say that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has forged documents so that one would not come upon him.
He even managed to lead his bosses backwards, even if the Eurex Stock Exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profile
Did he fear to fly?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Already during my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was observed.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
He earned a lot with the Alliance ’ s shares by putting half a billion euros in the London bombings on price losses of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
If you make a profit, let us leave you
"That's like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or guessed.
"As long as I earned money, the eyes were closed."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
He lost one billion euros in a single day.
One weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion.
And how did they come upon him?
He was suspicious of a holiday.
"I took only four days from last year.
A broker who doesn ’ t take a holiday is one who doesn ’ t want to look at him in the cards, ” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
A total of nine development programmes were signed yesterday by Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the next few years (about EUR 365 billion).
This is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Enterprise and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will go into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The programme "Enterprise and Innovation" aims to help entrepreneurs and companies to gain funding for innovative enterprises.
Companies should thereby gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic among the new acceding countries is one of the least successful in the past.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty years of imprisonment for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twentieth year imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether Alemán is allowed to sit down at home, or whether he has to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court ruled that Alemán had regularly postponed government money to accounts of foreign firms in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and in reality the accounts belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yes, it is done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had submitted it, and therefore the ČSSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies approved this traditionally little respected yet highly significant law in peace.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a thankful topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to it.
A political dispute is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses among the previous social-democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure compulsory by law, not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the fiscal deficits of municipalities.
The greatest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the municipal budget deficit.
Many mayors, in order to tap into other sources of investment, except income from taxes, levies, and bank loans, often issued unreasonably bonds through which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they received from the state in the course of privatisation.
Now this source is already lost.
To the extent that we only comply with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for some years, which the ČSSD boasts without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge shame, mainly attributable to previous governments.
We are among the countries least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been superfluously inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Although it has been possible to delete some of the nonsense populist expenditure that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the retirement age and pension reform are not postponed in the near future, then virtually every policy in this country will end and, no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but mere administrators.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians will become officials who divide most of the tax revenue mechanically between pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year ’ s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the repression of normal expenditure by mandatory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner in 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not want it to really happen that politicians in power become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take taxes and fees to seek calm in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will enable a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
For example, more than $100 billion will be spent on currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, while another 24 loosens it for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time after the September 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to averting or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step aims to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can lend", wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what they can do when they decide to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly impacting economic growth around the world.
After they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the central banks decided to do so by using the London interbank interest rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other, even though US, Canadian, and UK central banks had lowered interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this move is helping central banks to heal the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he explained that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my views."
Now prospective customers could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, capable of understanding and evaluating technical treatises, had experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and thus do not constitute a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, and he regards this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna at the Hayek institute two months ago.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driving licence
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where the exchange can be applied for, so that the authorities can issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will enter the streets after the New Year without valid driving authorisation.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive did not exchange their driving licence.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of fuel tickets, the offices of the capital are overcrowded with applications, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The exhibition of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not manage the mandatory exchange by the end of the year and who do not have a valid driving licence, will face a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a warning when transgressing.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the one who does not drive can also be punished by the community.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the offices to be gentle and to impose at most a fine of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns penalty.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should leave their driving licence.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from the years 1994 to 2000 have another three years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of making a joint case with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years imprisonment respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organised Crime" threatened 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision by the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but he is at first faced with the judgment of the first instance.
In other cases, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He can no longer be condemned.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty mainly of participating in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the indictment from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with, among other things, Berdych criminals handed over information from sources of police, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to avoid prosecution.
The band gave Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the loot.
The indictment is about crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
Particularly for robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for presumption of office and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser telescope and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robberies.
Besides nearly 20 men in this case, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's vicinity have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in prison in Ireland and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped the main hearing.
Children swapped - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, intends to demand compensation of 12 million crowns plus court costs from the Třebíč hospital.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Therefore, the legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not agree at all with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is much too high," Dostál said after today's negotiations.
"However, in order to be able to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the other side had to draw up.
We will determine whether it has any significance at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of cases for everyone ", Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for each month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was a report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry.
The men were better tolerated by the stress situation, even if they saw themselves accused that they could have prevented the confusion of newborns.
The women, in turn, get worse with the after-effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is currently happening, Veleba summarized the content.
On 9 December last year Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina district head (Bohemian Moravian Height) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the failure of the Třebíč hospital, which is under the responsibility of the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they must use a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance to the institution.
The courts have assigned comparatively low damages to those affected so far, the amounts were determined by tables and were in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the regional court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Wallachian King", but the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team wishing to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said after the hearing Polívka's lawyer.
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian in the words "Walachisches Königreich".
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities, "he said.
According to him, the cause is quarrel over money.
"After years they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have something of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work, "he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Wallachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At that time, however, this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš thought about spending Wallachian passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized out of an originally fun action, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passes and even offered reductions to their owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the mere idea Polívka made public for his entrepreneurial intentions in the programme "Manege".
"Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted themselves to it intensively.
The cooperation of the parties divided today lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nimmerlein's Day".
The leadership then claimed Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen ’ s Mother at the suggestion.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king was to emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush.
It should be something like the King's procession in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also register quietly, "added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile schwinden
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The station wagon with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Continue fast
I go through the interior only briefly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the poor middle tunnel.
Since I would welcome some more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the larger dimensions of the body.
In the combo also the already mentioned lack of headroom is eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the hold.
I have to call this (also because of the folding back window) very good loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold on to heavier objects.
But let us talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment it is 428 liters, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains by clearly noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a baby cot.
But in order to emphasize the positive, I still have to mention the very flat loading space or also the very low loading edge after the folding of the rear seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, this is what a 1600 cubic engine should look like, driving a Hatchback family.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems to be clogging his exhaust with a cloth, then I can only be delighted with him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
We must remember, however, that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er petrol engine in height of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
We had however head bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window lifters behind and and...
Thus the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, but calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils at British schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases of violence between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflict between the locals and Slovak immigrants is gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and rivalries among pupils have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended themselves by insulting them with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then uncovered his buttocks, "a mother of Slovak students of The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is getting more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been registered who came here looking for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students therefore attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20th century.
One of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it built, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, skyscrapers were growing, and cars across the wide boulevards were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America signed their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can enjoy cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties are still driving around in Havana, because the once imported igulis and fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere can you find in the vicinity as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are just being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was a green light for this development.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte, which is unique in the world and attracts above all railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet was not renewed for decades, and so one sees there cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long since been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It is worth mentioning that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway estate, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
Perhaps it seems interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the area with the rest of the country.
This insulation helped to keep it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the "valley of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which livens up after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
UNESCO recorded this eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage List thanks to the untouched nature there.
Here the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra and Maestra mountains, the pork power and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not proceed according to their ideas; in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries stationed in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for more activity for NATO units, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
A further part is to allow the inhabitants to start developing their own economies and security, "said the British Defense Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and even by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit as regards the organisation and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they call for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop said today.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little, "said De Hoop of Reuters agency to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been controversy among the countries involved about whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the challenges for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said Gates.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers as lazy furs this week.
"Afghan non-students are unmasking: the Germans are playing games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went over to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
In 2009, sovereign debt will rise to one trillion
Every Czech has a national debt of 84000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to pay 159.2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of government budgetary policies.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
As a result, they rose by 40.2 billion in the first nine months of this year.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on sovereign debt at the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be exceeding the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns, "said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of Next Finance, says: "We could come to exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change, "he said.
Debt Growing
The national debt stems from the government ’ s debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
National debt is financed by treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
Domestic national debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state rose by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of public debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much given how good the economy is.
It is interesting to note that the growth is mainly due to the bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes, "Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to absorb 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the better development of government budgetary policies.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It also includes a maximum of EUR 13.3 billion for the consolidation agency, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, 43 billion for government bonds and 1.8 billion for bonds at the European Investment Bank.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been indicted for insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment and expulsion by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of having allowed six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
It would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Education, the 54 year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, as the class votes, 20 of 23 children elect Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not carry a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simply that the presentation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who is teaching at the same school in Sudan, said that he knows them well, and that she would never have done anything to bring them closer to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many students of the teacher share, who describe them as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks in class about religion.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is at the same time also the second name most frequently given in Great Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is regarded as a kind of homage to the prophets (often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, said European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace is at stake in the region, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are very strong tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, united by the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane and Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last meeting of negotiations since last August the Troika had received the mandate from the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their conciliation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo ’ s independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, an amicable solution, said Botsane Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years under UN administration, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Regrettably, no agreement could be reached, as Fatmir Séluu, President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino's effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence by the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly afraid of a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have taken two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalist replied to Fatmir Séluu that the Parliament of Kosovo would have the last word on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence would take place on the part of the Albanian speaking population in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace that they agreed in 2003.
The White House leader stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas are ultimately seeking a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including key issues.
This designation comprises the three serious problems that are the main focus of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were driven out of their homes in the present state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly, and that a settlement should be provided for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook to conduct the upcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption, and to make an effort to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received Bush ’ s assurance in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Arab-language daily, which is financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car drove on the rue Louise Michel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m. towards Villiers and Bel.
He had no mission, but was on a stripe, and drove with 40 km / h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without admission, thus not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, approached at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its ancestry from the right, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is a lot negative.
The condition of the car (worn-out fenders, split windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the vehemence of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted to the IGPN an investigation into the "Facts of involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the Chief Public Security Directorate of Val -d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she was excluding the responsibility of the police at this stage of the IGPN.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small motorcycle was relatively fast on its left side.
Yesterday, a sort of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrest on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained intertwined until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were duplicated yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday, in Villiers, Bel quickly made a rumour that the police had left the accident very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigations are needed, and where one must proceed very carefully.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who limped.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth telephone.
In view of the tension that had quickly arisen around the event and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still according to this testimony, the police arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow the police forces to be claimed to have given no help to young people.
These young people have been given first aid.
The fire brigade came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared the emergency two days earlier.
According to testimonies, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the emergency measures had been injured by the tear gas grenades used by the police there.
They then threw stones to hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court ’ s bar have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposition activists, advocates of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyers ’ movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis and Amal, whose president called on the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf ’ s promise no longer applies
Pakistan's Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The chairman of the court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was relieved and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional, and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News said.
Pervez Musharraf ’ s promise to surrender the command to the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the emergency was invoked, said on Monday the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
Moreover, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Law, which allowed contraception in France, one out of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or spiral, still have a failure rate of 5%.
According to the institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users aged between 20 and 40 years using the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
With one of five couples even calculated on the month accurately, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools designed by astronauts to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical part that was soon to accommodate European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was thus to implement a 17.5 ton power generation module via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew decided to restructure the solar panels of the module, with a span of 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be opened like accordions, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped so as not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts who were originally supposed to leave the Discovery space shuttle for a control gear and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was incorrect were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 metre long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle attached to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilful, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
The 46 year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After he had thoroughly assessed the damage, he severed the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rails on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had designed and built on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to presumably take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
Following the announcement by the Aviation and Defence Group that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M ’ s residues, EADS currently shows a marked decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% on the Paris Stock Exchange at €21.96.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 next Thursday when presenting its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the delay of another programme, the very large A380 carrier aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting to count the polls: the mass of Russians will opt for President Putin ’ s party, United Russia.
After a very deregulated election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast on public broadcasters to voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Kremlin Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to see when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with providing a new attack on the Western powers accused of interference – his favourite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition ’ s point of view, they have squandered.
It denounces an election campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, for former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days imprisonment for unauthorized demonstrating, according to his lawyer continued to ban visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two much further questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The Official Journal yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot take up a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the almighty party United Russia, which will elect government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of Saint Petersburg goes even further: the bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties, Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully adopted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians freely renounce the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why still consider for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all strata of society, including business.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54 year-old professor: Why still long superior?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they replace them?
A heavy souvenir
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not been seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. by requesting a former victim or his relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven state administrators, including Germany, France, Israel and the US, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable them to carry out research, especially on deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers, explains Reto Meister, head of these archives, which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Such as alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The list of inmates in the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for them to compensate.
Even today in Bad Arolsen more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal enquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One should expect nothing fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, director of the research center for anti-Semitism of the Technische Universität Berlin, had declared 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten products most frequently exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion annually, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern about the credit terms and announced an offer of £10 billion with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to alleviate fears that conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its savings during the conservation period, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, it states in a communication.
The Bank further states that on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, £10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be put into circulation, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has circulated liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of interbank lending, which vary from day to day, with their basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has swung to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the summer ’ s financial crisis, the sums circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that prevented banks from claiming them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound price as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of which were 50% for employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIPP flottante, for a transport cheque or for restricting rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partly violent changes of speech between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television report on purchasing power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances that the Assamblee had examined last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honour for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival of the movement in America, Charlie Jones informed from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been working as a co-owner for the production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he has ever been to, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side in order to offer the area a festival of European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working hard with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, according to Charlie Jones.
We negotiated mt the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at the Grand Park Chicago, after having made its mark in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to generate $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax transactions in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another in order to simultaneously give the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to record a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent promoter ’ s award of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if there is no less than the terminator.
These temptations are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Gouvernator"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that conditions are favourable in Montreal, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you consider to be the best, "he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the priority at the moment is the advancement of the cinema there.
Hunting for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the stock exchange face a final year of Rally? Disunity among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the annual financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the coming final year.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock exchange is normally accompanied by a positive market trend
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to produce forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is severely affected by the upward trend towards high-value assets.
Consequently, according to these experts, the stock exchange will tend to have a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the size of the possible decline in the US Federal Reserve ’ s interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of the rise in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market for Rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% at 15,945.7 points since its peak on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund, which was made at this time each year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop slightly differently this year, mainly because of the final year of the Rally, which already took place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge-day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a derogation from the index values, whose size depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree in selecting the values that will push the Ibex to new heights.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that this year the big values are in line.
Among the value winners would be the expert of the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive in due course.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, says the expert.
In the last half of the year, periodic consumption will determine market activity in terms of increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented only in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two declining price movements.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the so far last real end-year rally.
This year, with Ibex 35 catching up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% increase in prices.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and will also show an end-year rally.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular is the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The Bank ’ s current negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim for an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open in the afternoon on a weekday, albeit not for the customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on Popular Bank ’ s experience.
And it is precisely this that Popular intends to pursue with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches which, due to their location, can capture the merchandise of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours is connected with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring would not require major investments, but would be accompanied by an increased recruitment, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The subsidiaries, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, said Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for this purpose, which seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approx. 2500 branches.
And another 60, who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete with our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have come preliminary to the agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking staff.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, gave his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The transmitter led by him had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: this is exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too low.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the goodwill now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has posted a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half of 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other publicly traded communications companies, on the other hand, is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (editor of the journal Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that they are two similar companies, says Vasile.
There is still uncertainty as to the extent to which we can actually operate on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first television station to receive more than 1000 million gross gains from advertising revenues this year, according to Guiseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the Group ’ s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales rose 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business had only an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
Analysts see the main factor in the comparison of Telecinco ’ s improved stock market performance as being the high payout ratio that the company has had up to the present time: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría generated a 100% dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose equity values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the Endemol stake.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain trends in losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high return on efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco measures (buy) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases in light of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees to the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which ended its meeting today with the Senate Congress resolution on the supplementary / amendments to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congressmen and Senate Members, who had pursued the goal in their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible regulation, which guarantees the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market event.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, increasing the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to offer financial advice to both specialised companies and to individuals or legal entities, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting firms associated with the investment and mediation companies of securities.
It also expands the number of systems for implementing financial transactions, adding to regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of securities business and the systems for internationalising trade contracts, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to identify the focal points of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate their control role for CNMV.
In retrospect, the Congress ’ s Economic Commission envisaged further changes, with the US mortgage and banking crisis confirming the decision that, due to its high risk level for the investor, the bond provided with titles must now be regarded as complex financial resources.
Furthermore, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the fields of work of diploma economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation limiting the areas of work reserved for economists was adopted.
For its part, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the business mediator, who works on external account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition simultaneously several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union delivers the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to achieve a local and quality comparison with US products through the disclosure of the data.
The prognosis for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to assess the information not available at the time of the calculation.
The Spanish Statistics Office (INE), however, warned that the prematurely determined indicator would only serve as a guideline, and therefore did not comply with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (TPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Economic and Financial Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in the TPI in November was a temporary development, while at the same time asserting that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress Building that even if the present figure is not good, Spain ’ s inflation difference to the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Economics and Finance Minister announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock ’ s assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank asked the Federal Reserve for an emergency loan in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they now amount to only £12,000 million (equivalent to EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank ’ s assets amounted to a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the customer ’ s loss of confidence, and also despite the government ’ s 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to bring in about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will consist of the assets of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the GBP 18 billion that is still needed to achieve its target of 30 billion.
The multi-millionaire Richard Branson group, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to make £50,000 million (equivalent to around €70 million) a year into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the municipality of Murcia, Totano (Partido Popular), for the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and then chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wire-puller of the plot.
The officials continue to browse the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
The lawyer was also accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information provided by the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged Member of Parliament Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client ’ s residence due to important burdensome documents related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged order payments Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract, in which the development of a 200 hectare area was decided.
At present, eight persons are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the Socialist President and Secretary General José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of the Socialists, will take over the office of Congress President.
José Blanco, PSOE ’ s organizational secretary, and Bono announced it at the press conference after meeting Zapatero today at the party ’ s headquarters.
According to the Heads of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the coming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of the Congress, who had announced last 15 November that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, that he would end his career in public politics, and instead commit himself to climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that, since his resignation two years ago, the president of the district government had been continuously pushing for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deny citizens who would take over the position of President of Congress in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a House of Respect, not an insult or a scream, in order to make it ever more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, one gets the impression from time to time, as if the only place in which one cannot speak calmly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the mayor in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work, suggesting that he did not want to appear to have taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate criticises both the sceptics of climate change and those who place a social and political debate in the foreground in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him into need of declaration on his government ’ s action or non-action, which has played a decisive role in ensuring that Spain is at the forefront of the countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are those responsible for the failure to comply with the specifications, to which sectors this is due, and why did his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development.
Furthermore, it is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures it is proposing to combat climate change without hesitation.
What companies will be affected by it, what behaviour citizens will be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what economic consequences this will have.
More specifically, who must sacrifice himself and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there are and will be no such declarations in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures that can be used to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero in terms of choice that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his treaties with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his meekness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the Treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the municipality of Totana, which belongs to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police chief, the mayor's secretary and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody because of the alleged suspicion of urban violations.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is still located, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the searches already carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban development projects were to be redesigned under the direction of Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration granted illegal commissions to it during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrested were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, also against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales is investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have served as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the municipality of Murcia, which should contain more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which had to be rebuilt. The aim was to realize a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price of other name with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; accidentally on that day, the issue of which contained the criticism of Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become after the tragedy around the school of Jokela topic of public debate.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a graduate who cited in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, called on teachers to take a more critical position against Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be deleted from the sub-levels of the teaching curriculum for philosophy at grammar schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of law, which would be considered with six months imprisonment.
But if you rob a music business below a value of 400 euros again, this is only a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you pick a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than to exchange music data.
Participating in a rebellious dispute entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange entails a deprivation of freedom of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is regarded as less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright protected films whose authorisation has not taken place by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has very well screwed up his demands.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly pay are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was compiled using a tomographically magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Life & Brain brain research center in Bonn, the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus had the same content; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Public Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the prosecutor ’ s office of the Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - are the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are listed by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a model for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that pursues the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the speed of a political thriller to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on their respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which depends again on different factors, e.g. on age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, type of the car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
Firstly, we need to be clear about what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insured party.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding compensation sum in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance, which consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices in accordance with the statistics, so that higher contributions are due in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women will have to pay less, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same also applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the enterprises, these tend to fewer accidents like single persons.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
At this point, we are now listing the most important points that should be taken into account when selecting an insurance policy in order to make not only a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under 25 years of age encounter numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as the low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out comprehensive insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a full debt with excess, so that the benefits of a full debt insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer has to pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the amount to be paid, says Luis Noguera, Spain ’ s main representative at First Europa, an online insurance mediation company.
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is a Council.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic tariff at the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in these tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its proceeds.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25 year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
It is therefore most sensible to opt for a comprehensive insurance with excess.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the beginner ’ s fear has been lifted.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer, who does not have children, to take out a comprehensive insurance; of course only if the financial situation of the respective person allows it.
The insurers consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly their contributions are low.
In this case, full insurance with deductible (for an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third vehicle year.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution payment, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a comprehensive insurance with deductible (for an amount of 150 Euros), or an extended insurance, which only uses with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow is hoping for the eighth round in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight next Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two matches of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of the game, as FC Milan will compete in the FIFA Bundesliga World Cup in Japan, where he will compete for the first time in the semi-finals, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be completed before all the others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium will be the all-awaited result, even if both teams will try to win. Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be group first in case of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the Eighth finals.
Gordon Strachan ’ s team could even be defeated in a slump of Shakhtar FC to qualify. Nevertheless, he shouldn ’ t rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points of tie the Ukrainians have to take part; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2 points 1), but were able to win in the second match (2 points 0).
So the Milanese will try to spoil the Scots for the evening. Again, they hope to reach for the second time in a row the second round of the redesigned Championsleague, after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the penalty (1 penalty 0) and by a zero to zero draw on the penalty.
While Shakhtar FC is waiting for Rossoneri ’ s victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as reaching the Eighth finals as well as joining UEFA will depend on his victory and defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower position in the championship, and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place by a victory and thus participate in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band dissolved in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert in the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the atmosphere in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people witnessed the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the band ’ s history, which caused a sensation in the late nineties, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album containing their biggest hits and two more new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on the stage, which the husband of Posh Spice, the English football player David Beckham, had previously given them.
The sportsman was among the crowds of fans who made the GM Palace glow, even though his wife Victoria's nerves had forbidden him in the preceding days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British star didn ’ t even see our wardrobe, and that ’ s why I ’ m quite excited about what he ’ ll say about the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 caused the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal differences, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes were eliminated and that everyone was now very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines aircraft, according to a report by the television station CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is wafting between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia ’ s gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine, and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit charges.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important guest transit states in talks," said the Minister of Economy of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of Reuters news agency.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments about the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drastically boosted prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union ’ s supply.
Russia has the world ’ s largest gas reserves, but much remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the Pre-Criminal Register for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service had no precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at Old Bailey in October and was burdened in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor ’ s report now states, among other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines for the execution of criminal records, which helps employers with controls in different countries.
"Although we found references to these controls in some personnel documents, they were not routinely carried out", the report noted.
Black said that Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative directives to a high degree before hiring, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chief Executive Officer Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-appointment tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was probably higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who were allowed to leave indefinitely.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely respected.
These include passport, work permit and qualification controls.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for controls prior to the start of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Trudeau said: "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices would be reflected in updated guidance on monitoring prior to recruitment by all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled for next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among others for the best film.
Prizes were also awarded to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded the best leading actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond ’ s actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing British film to the world.
Prices were handed over at a ceremony in London ’ s Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis ’ rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has won two prizes for the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known so far for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree - as the best director and the best directing debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia player in David Cronenberg ’ s London thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50 year-old, Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He ’ s my type of man, a great actor of his time, I ’ m really honored. ”
The independent film prizes, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The world ’ s largest oil exporter ’ s state television said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in rockets.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35.000 strong rapid reaction force to protect equipment after an abusive Al Quaida attack on the world ’ s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to a declaration of internal ministers, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "rocket expert" who migrated illegally into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners were accused of killing clergy and security forces.
The government has warned more to do to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias regard many clergy in Saudi Arabia as in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias, accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda ’ s Saudi leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government, are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings, and energy sector installations.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman of the Interior Ministry told the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the Earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on an orbit show that the planet is even more like a deviated twin of the Earth than was previously known.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have ruled conditions that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower speed of rotation Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricanes of strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe from the European Space Agency, which examined the planets for a year, provide a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said, "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A penalty officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency ultimately agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters take up questions on video and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the democrats, asked about global warming in the other party ’ s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, reflect this time exactly the state of the Republican Party, which is entering the elections next year.
It is not known, just like CNN ’ s producers, who supported the debate by selecting YouTube clips to be shown to the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single subject, immigration was the focus.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: the television company noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call that he was indulgent about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing Massachusetts ’ s former governor of having hired illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two particularly engaged as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
None of the two men has serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have carved ahead of the immigration package earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates largely share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe each word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the position that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now on top of all expectations in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would advocate them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee ’ s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul ’ s recent fundraisers and his incidental storms in Wednesday ’ s debate.
These two are out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has consistently united the party from the outset with a victorious message about America ’ s greatness and a wink to the party ’ s two wings.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to invade; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals this is not particularly slippery.
No nobility titles seem to be sold, no politician pays Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has veiled donations to the British ruling Labour Party for more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister withdrew from calling for an election, insulting the British intelligence in a stupid way by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly acute leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, Stalin ’ s once feared Brown has evolved into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Worse thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by the tax authorities of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative bottlenecks.
A trio of retired generals started a Upper House uprising in protest against cuts in military spending: being military ministers, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours General Secretary (and her former head of fulfilment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably sets off.
Yet governments can reach a turning point that makes it impossible to govern.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not even need to be involved for a long time, this delay is over: the public service begins to leak; cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown ’ s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if it wasn ’ t directly involved in Blair ’ s misfortunes – as with the long “money for aristocracy ” investigation of political party financing – voters may assume that it was.
Nevertheless, Brown ’ s situation is not quite as bad as it looks
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely dizzy.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown ’ s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new commitment to political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but he was not entitled to the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham ’ s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours ’ s main financial collector, who was told about the odd donations in October.
But so far, Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusion, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grasping a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to make the measure full, by a bishop retired and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it is one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent public standards committee, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a thorough reform of political party financing.
That would require Labour hardliners to cooperate with conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with trade unions - bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unquestionable righteousness and solid competence.
Cardsharks
Is America ’ s credit card market caught up in the credit crisis?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America ’ s real estate market is raging, predators are targeting the country ’ s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded credit spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both bookings and default rates that measure the share of loans that are either unrecoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it has withdrawn a $1.4 billion fee from its US consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It is nevertheless too early to panic.
Losses and failures are still low.
According to rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for a large proportion of card losses; the number of applications (and hence default fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card based securities is fairly strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infectious channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debt, now that home loans dry out.
The card exhibitors, however, look at the flow of money instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial for card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates fall when real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt is becoming more important under the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and completely reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones ’ main financial adviser.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers profess guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief finance officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were guilty of amending their applications on Wednesday.
Initially, David BerTrudeau, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications media for alleged conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before US district judge Ewing Werlein Junior pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron ’ s collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against them in 2002 drew the attention of Fastow to the fact that he was the goal of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to wipe out a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron ’ s machinations that have helped to tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its shareholding in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Koppers control acquired the Bank ’ s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow mistakenly told Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others saw about 12.3 million dollars, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of conspiracy for his role in Enron ’ s bankruptcy on two counts.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is imprisoned for 6 years in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was at liberty on the basis of a $1 million deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation ’ s seventh largest corporation, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks stopped obscuring the billions of debt or making undertakings profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value, and more than $2 billion pension plans.
The Enron premier founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles related to the Enron collapse.
Skilling is fined for more than 24 years.
Lay ’ s convictions for conspiracy, fraud, and other charges became void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a roll-Royce and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a Four Day Orgy of Shown Consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition booths, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from mahogany padded yachts to diamond covered car grills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's a small change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas at its glorious times.
"We have gone through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in droves where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world ’ s most visible free-floating money-publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, has attracted ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Moreover, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
For the first time she visited the trade fair together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I have looked at the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a Red Carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to focus primarily on the neo-rich, the type of Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic jams for several hours to visit a courteous warehouse that, shamelessly, placed side by side with Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick Eiskrem, tailor-made billiard tables, appartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotic at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt picture of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climate change."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the President of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said that he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resemble linked chain arm tires, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino seater, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will store it in his 30- or 40-carriage garage."
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend they were rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone booths based on the British model, which were filled with mountains of false millions of dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the pile of money, mobile phone photos, while they lean back in the midst of the spare wealth, to let friends kneel, or simply to plug in a few millions.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
botched operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Day when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon afterwards there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box van of the medical morgue approaching," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon, whom the police did not identify, and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what has caused Arroyo ’ s death, and are hopeful that toxococological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to elucidate a mysterious death that has sent a mourning by the leadership of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and stubborn," said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephony interview on Wednesday.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control mission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It is a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled with "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him cope with the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing. "
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world tactics markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market openings that the central bank will attempt to calm the credit markets by further interest-rate cuts were reinforced by appeasing comments from the vice-president of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York, and across Europe, after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Central Bank, said that politics had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure daunting markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
Should the increased turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The statements also helped to calm Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that US property sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-reduction measure to offset heavy losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S & P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the $100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of British default values.
Germany ’ s index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France ’ s CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month auction of European Central Bank guarantees granted to European commercial banks was lent at a remarkable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed further capital into the money markets in London rose when the credit tensions were seen to rise to the highest level since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November, the three month Libor rates for lending between UK banks at 6.59%.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who will beat Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important, because David Graveney, the president of the election, is here at least under this special title, to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, gradually fills itself with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his career, while someone else never exceeds the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck instead of skill.
It is not only in cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah when he does it?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good qualifications who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless it is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but there are opportunities to do so.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain ’ s eye at the right time when he can take a Wicket and a bat must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind is sticking into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a viewpoint.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or perhaps it makes little difference.
Four years ago Gareth Batty played in each test in Sri Lanka and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was still struggling to consolidate himself at that time, who made the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah ’ s greater experience of Bopara ’ s youthful enthusiasm after another discussion at today ’ s Asgiriya Stadium net session.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent record against rotated balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selection team as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a vivid joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a Kricketplatz and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overturned a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his team-mate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm: "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his middle speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Perhaps that is the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah might not stand well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has ceased to kill people, "he said, in relation to the Shiite militia of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38 year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, backed by the US, helped drive Al Qaeda out of its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades, after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today, "said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been enticed by the increasing tranquility in the capital since the US military increase and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who were armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more talked about being forced home in Damascus by visa problems and futile funds, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51 year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are likely to have fled sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia residential areas and vice versa, creating many places where tensions have diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and conflict will arise.
Kleines Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field does the Saarland press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I told a non-saarland that we are not French" - this slogan is self-ironic about his 50th birthday in the smallest federal state.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in fifth place in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
The universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries by tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But Saarland also brings the children of the state to higher education in an above-average number - many of them without a degree at the grammar school.
"The vocational education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their academic qualification at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also comparatively strongly expanded.
According to the population, the equipment with dual courses of study is the second best in Germany.
Despite practice-oriented training and increasing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at general schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced country-wide comparative tests.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last kindergarten year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal states.
Only future comparative studies will show whether the performance of the pupils will improve sustainably.
At Pisa in 2003, the share of risk students shrank from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians expect better.
And to the dismay of the Saarland foreign language skills are not measured with Pisa - in this area one could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is obligatory at high schools - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez replaces the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez is turning the timepieces back in the South American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez becomes a witty figure.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, a new law states that the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, who is hostile to the US, justified his decision, among other things, by imposing the United States of the world on the division into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the disruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do so because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing forward with constitutional reform, on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was Uribe ’ s decision to withdraw Chávez ’ s mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which concerned the release of hostages.
Uribe "spitted" Venezuela with his decision, had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new mobile phone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
Spain ’ s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the left populist ’ s constant calls at the recent Ibero-America summit, spoke to him.
German threatens wage minus in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are likely to lose real wages this year, according to a forecast.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Boeck Foundation, employees could expect less in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price reductions in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the Bild newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
The finance minister, Peer, said the "New Osnabrück Newspaper" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it had become known that the price explosion in food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the Earth
In spite of its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it was flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided the proof - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soups" theory, lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the devil's twin of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in size and size, has taken such a completely different development, is the basic question of Esa's mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus's research, since no probe was on its way to explore this planet since the early nineties.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighbouring planet with the Earth are larger than initially assumed," says Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also called Morning or Evening Star, circles around the sun in almost 225 days.
But it is much slower about itself: a Venus day lasts 243 days on earth.
Although Venus hardly resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Both collected water that remained on Earth in oceans but was lost on Venus into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, Venus accounts for most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany ’ s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled an understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, emphasised the Federal President, but he took Merkel into protection against the accusation that she is implementing a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not refrained from the traditional One – China policy.
China knows that too, "said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown resentment about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the Union ’ s “window window policy ” in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in the German / Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German finance minister, Peer, (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries, according to information provided by Spiegel.
China ’ s head of government, Wen Jiabao, has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the Dalai Lama ’ s reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama ’ s actions and words showed that he is trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge itself into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the heavy youth crawls in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We have to make sure that social explosives do not build up and discharge ourselves into violence.
We have to take this seriously, "he said to the" New Press "in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal government, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it was too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police in the past nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the riots in France Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action is needed.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people under 25 years of age with a migrant background is "above average".
More training places have to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control in the families takes place".
Many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Kolat admonished: "But we still have to be careful."
One must "give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers and Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and a few burning trash bins and cars.
Since the day before, a group of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace of mind.
After a visit to the suburbs, the police would go through as long as it was necessary.
During the night on Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured at riots in Villiers and Bel.
In the following night, the unrest on Toulouse spread.
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor ’ s office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor ’ s non-reality appearance documents that the coalition is in the end – and that nothing can be expected of it.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live?
After her bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was worthless and poor in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country, which should finally be governed by her.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she is concentrating too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
This was provincial, she said, and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, it has clearly documented how much their accusation applies.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a detached politician who flees to foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Example climate protection: She praises herself unchecked for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodesty the CDU leader would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flickering that the upswing is coming to people.
In this way, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautifying the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-earners?
She has a few additional sets left for this.
It is significant how often it promises to be when it comes to childcare.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube headline debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney exchanged hard – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged on the first topic.
He has made New York a "haven for illegal immigrants," whereas Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
For his part, he counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," Giuliani replies and accuses the former Governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30 seconds of videos that Internet users sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the reactions of the Saalpublikum in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the campaign ’ s important topics are now beyond Iraq ’ s war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, the auditorium applauds.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was mistaken at the time," says Romney in a crushing tone, and makes a plea to the base and television audience that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the swing when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan ’ s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he surrendered his post as Army Chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bowing international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former General now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his swearing-in, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thus fulfil another demand from the West.
Last week, the Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had appointed with him, following the establishment of the state of emergency in early November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers and four others were killed and injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan.
According to an army officer, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany ’ s supergroup of the seventies played again: the three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
A recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears at the Revival.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius is enthroned in a flower white shirt at the age of 63.
Left side flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, seen from the auditorium, Hans Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some excitement among Krautrock and fans.
Here you can reveal: Targeted inquiries revealed that the name was confusing through collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is called misleading Krautrock has always been more true in England and America than in one ’ s own country.
When the music industry gave the survivor of the Cologne group Can 2003 the echo award for life ’ s work, one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later crouched on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in strangers is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and in this time also developed a far lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First they played in the cellar under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped with Kraftwerk for a short time and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group.
Around 1973 Rother followed the cluster and musicians into exile to Forst im Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban fleeting communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to suffer as a nanny.
Rather in spiky artistic existence.
Allegedly, a pennant of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for art was found in the bulky waste.
Some people held Harmonia away from it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because the music sounded so relaxed and modest, the band suffered material hardship.
The collecting of rice was not only self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember.
From Rother came then the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoteric Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Grönland has set itself the goal of cultivating the Krautrock as their very own German contribution to lively music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berliner Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Brite, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The Loveparade is also the inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's movement floats with the most unusual sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
Projections of further black-and-white photos of wirr wired devices serve to create the legend.
Prior to that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technically deepened tuftlers.
The chorus of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are blown up and waved and sung in a beautiful place with an emphatic "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia cannot be brought away from it even now.
The most natural thing is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can deprive you of your nerves or give you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace" two films deal again with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and bumps or they are too touching.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" cannot help.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia and War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and irrelevant roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism made you want to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - Wenn der Jäger zum Gejagten" (Why do film titles today always have to be as long and confused as locomotive leaders' collective agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully twinkle with the eye: basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long passed his very best times, but who has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm as a ruined monument of his decline.
But in spite of this trump, "The Hunting Party", together with the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" (Murderous Peace), which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, and one of them falls in love with them.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not represented here as the sole root of all evils, the TV-flat film loses itself too quickly in bumps and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored as an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film before.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to find the Serbian Upper War criminal "the fox" could perhaps have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories resemble each other in a striking way: both times small teams go into the woods to do something that the military cannot do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the rundown cynicist with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also address a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the brook if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse procedure within the last five minutes, which NATO, CIA and all bounty hunters in the world did not manage in five years: Catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague is being referred to for crimes against kinology.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should be exceptionally agreed) not to pursue the persecution too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht ’ s poem comes to mind.
In it it says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassion I see the swollen foreheads, indicating how exhausting it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they indicate how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq ’ s Hollywood films were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South African movie.
Almost always applies: When a star drives around on the crisis herds or mine fields of the world, then something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some movies will probably still mature - the now considered classics Vietnam's works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at that time.
But perhaps we know today, where each mass murder comes in real time on equal two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the inattentiveness they need to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" finally became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really reigned.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good films.
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distanced view of the artist of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Wörterbuch" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia. "
By Beust reapes criticism for Olympic rejection
The retreat of the mayor from Hamburg ’ s bid for the Olympic Summer Games has met with fierce criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But Beust admonishes realism in assessing opportunities.
On Wednesday, the Executive Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans Jörg Schmidt, described Trenz as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sporting momentum would not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt and Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach "based on a changed time beam".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained unrealistic on Wednesday with earlier statements that Hamburg ’ s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for the 2018 Winter Games.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period we have planned until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed up for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build up an opportunity to bury the plans already at this time," HSB's president Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD coalition accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleine Grasbrooks has been delayed by the Senate for years, because it put on the map Olympia and excluded the housing construction", said the SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
Whereas the SPD for Kleine Grasbrook had always called for integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use, the CDU had unilaterally relied on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had caused great enthusiasm at the time.
However, Hamburg had failed on Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Those who combine the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol ’ s catalogue of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" listed there are forgeries.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo and Boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a sobering result: the six "Brillo and Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type", which are in circulation on the international art market.
Prehistory is nested, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol in New York created his first "Brill Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red blue white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited – with Warhol ’ s agreement – hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: they were not from Warhol (for reasons of cost), but were delivered directly from the Brillo and cardboard factory.
It was not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses are now talking about around fifteen boxes, which at that time as authorised original Andy and Warhol and Brillo and Boxes with the designation "type Stockholm" have rightly entered into the history of art and auction.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about one hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, examined not only the six museum ’ s own Brillo and Boxes, but also three Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press chipboard was first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was directly applied to the pressing board with a painting roll without primer - besides, it is not oil paint but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo and Boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies / exhibition material."
Already in July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" made in respect of soap powders.
But since then they have been covered in relentless silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers have given up in a hotel in Manila, demanding the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused President of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been buried in the building for hours.
Around half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly sit down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen, who were supposed to guard him, had obviously overrun him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government troops blocked the district around the noble hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours due to the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at a coup against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
We now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated on.
Keep the option open to increase the share of Versatel.
With this step, United Internet announced the intention to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market.
Previously, assumptions about entry had already arisen on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considered the shares to be only a third party, it said in the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already contributed almost 10 percent to the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a UK Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of a good ten percent in Freenet and not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase the shareholding in Freenet AG.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has lasted for months and is still difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and full line customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch held 6.01 percent of Freenet's shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will contribute another approximately four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
