Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about being identified as Muppets
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed change of their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen over the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure could become a laughing stock.
A Labour Assembly member has claimed that his party was concerned that MWP was "back with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A Plaid Cymru party assembly member has commented that his party as a whole "does not see it in a good light" and has proposed various alternatives.
A Welsh conservative member said that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there was too little difference between the terms "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee tasked with drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: The final decision on any qualifications to name the Members of the assembly will of course fall to the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly full power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with widespread support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the assembly members, although the committee voted for Members of the Welsh Parliament or WPM, the MWP option received the widest support in the public consultation.
Members of the House are apparently suggesting different alternatives, but attempting to reach consensus could be a real nightmare for House Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft of the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The assembly members will hold the final vote on its naming during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
Citizens will vote on Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by the country to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the opinion that the name change is simply the price to be paid for becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of Harlem churches
"Historically, the elderly people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams says.
Today, there is no one left, neither of us.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have a different way of socializing these days", she says.
"Bars are no longer the kind of neighborhood living room where people used to go periodically".
As for the churches, he worries that the money they get from selling assets will not last as long as their leaders predict and sooner or later return to the place from which they came.
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will be of no help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he says, "and therefore what they will do is accelerate the closing of all the churches, since it is highly unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will end up being members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that originally existed in the area left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the property.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who were resisting hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carousel.
The Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the street as "the poor people's bells".
The expert who sounded the carillón in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first carriage in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the larger carriage at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been ringing in St. Martin's for the last few months, however, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the parish's governing body made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "wanted to pass the costs" on to the council, although the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while hunting for lobsters in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's cries for help, and they rowed to the boy's location to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he first thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then realized it was screaming 'M'han bitten!
They've bitten me!'
He had his whole collarbone torn off, Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
"To get everyone out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hammel adds.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not known what species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that a shark had been detected in the area for a few weeks, but it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty-product aisles in the style of large department stores staffed by specialist staff.
These large walk-ins are just one part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors lag behind, and will be tested in 11 shops across the country to expand to more stores next year if the trial becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously destined for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also be given more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots now.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect that is increasingly in demand by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also be opening concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first in Croydon, south London last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the change from a habit of buying food in smaller quantities each day from small supermarkets has meant that large supermarkets have had to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to boost the sales of food stores and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up being a disagreement over how to split the profits of the supermarket chain.
This new strategy comes after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its 281-pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a major role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We've invested in trained workers who will be of great help in offering counseling.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby is backed out of a £11m deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed out of an £11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle branding business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the joint Truly home goods and accessories business.
The business of these two media personalities had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones enraged by retiring at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report big profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red-haired TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new deals, worth £1.5 million, meant she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint Truly brand of home products and accessories.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back off left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from cushions and candles to clothes and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had been intimately involved with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Both couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We will not be making any comment on his business dealings".
Two accusations... and then we fell in love
He joked about the possible media criticism he would receive for making a comment that some would consider "not proper for a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump resign so quickly?
Trump said, all mocking the tone of a news anchor:
I've given up nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearisation are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to the first disarmament initiatives taken by his country.
However, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: an end to missile tests, help to free hostages and the return home of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded room, we'd have about 200", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Island destroyed and hundreds killed by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be catalyzed.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute in providing aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country is unfortunately still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Getting around the vast number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year loaded with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
Over 1,000 dead and tens of thousands of displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the equaliser with a long-range shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea with his own goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goalkeeper as his team were losing 1-0.
He moved the ball to the left before dropping an incredible shot to the second striker.
The shot crossed the entire area with a great lift as it propelled towards the right goal cross.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made a move and I didn't think much about it, I just threw myself into it.
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue forward returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic before kicking off from nearly half the field and sprinting into the Liverpool pitch.
Kovacic made a quick combo from the middle of the field.
Then, he made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overtook the defence to hit the second-row with a left-footed shot that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker missed.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from Indonesia's tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to figures from the country's disaster agency released Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was found stabbed.
The murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, aged 44, was found at 7:55 am with multiple stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; subsequently, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents of the area who have seen or heard anything in connection with the crime to report to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "While the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to call on anyone who is in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious, to please contact us.
I would like to make a call also to anyone, especially to the taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car's dashboard camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
While the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When she learned what had happened, she was speechless.
Residents are being warned that it will be hours before they can re-enter.
You could hear a police officer explaining to a man that the entire area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on stage crying.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordoned zone with another van parked outside.
A number of agents were inside the concession area controlling the apartment block.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning the September 30th dispatch 247.
The Cromwell statue in the British Parliament becomes the last monument to be affected by the debate around "re-writing history".
Its demise would be a kind of poetic justice for the Taliban's purest-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by its fanatical puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bogus lie" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor over the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to nineteenth-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than not now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a totally accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A murderous pig fatally wounds a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to a nearby pig pen.
According to him, in the courtyard there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pole had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn and bloodied", said the cousin, surnamed Wu, according to the evening news from Guiyang.
The footage recorded by the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One market official commented on the evening news that the pig was kept locked and isolated to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been previously recorded cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had run a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
He likes to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of doing harm.
Just give them the respect they deserve", he commented.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains across the southwestern United States
Forecasters say Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, which is a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am EST on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical moisture northward heading to the southwestern U.S.
El Rosa will drop up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers will form, as the situation is worsening very quickly due to the scattered nature of the tropical rainfall.
It is totally unwise to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause gorges to become uncontrolled rivers, and storms can bring gusting winds and dust clouds to specific spots.
The approaching depression will bring torrential downpours to certain points along the Southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 50 mm is possible, which could lead to minor waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated tropical rain showers will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
Torrential rains will spread to the Quatre Corners region on Tuesday and will continue through Wednesday.
October will see several significant temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, though the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The central region of the US on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to begin in October with warm weather in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) from the southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a strong possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers watched Thursday the passionate testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular Friday programming due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that over 20.4 million viewers watched this testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other networks that rebroadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people who see it from his office.
Put in perspective, this is a similar audience to that of a football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the network with the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's coverage, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was able to get 3.1 million, NBC was able to get 2.94 million, MSNBC was able to get 2.89 million, and CNN was able to get 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he was crushed by protesters as he attempted to climb into an elevator to go to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake remained blind for several minutes while being retaliated live on CNN television.
"Here I am, standing before you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, 'You have power, but so many women don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, he said he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Within hours, all the cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live the moment the House Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate to put it to a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee by next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After further conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had influence, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party convention in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview in addition to the one with May on the front page of the newspaper, May's former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, stating that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other's taxes is totally absurd.
Wayde Sims shooting death: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, a basketball player on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked into jail on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claim to have found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to shooting Wayde to death, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that has resulted in this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to local law enforcement for their "diligence and for bringing justice to the area".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was a 6'6" (1.98 m) point guard and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "shattered" and that Wayde's death was "a very big blow".
"Things like that are the ones that make you hurt all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash into Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The national disaster prevention center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several recent tremors and shaking.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were detained in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined in opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independence individuals detained by the anti-riot police began throwing eggs and paint in dust, which caused the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later that day, there were clashes with the police, who used their batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive" face to face with unionist protesters chanting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this region of independence-mindedness a year after the October 1 referendum held in Madrid was considered illegal by the Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a large majority, although the turnout was low, as the opponents of secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting by entering polling stations across the region, sparking violent clashes.
Separatist groups camped all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibility of Catalonia achieving independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they were able to vote, but now we are stuck", she commented.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit close, victory in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The tension is only increasing", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed ahead of trial since late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
Presenting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the backsliding in democratic values and the repression that we have seen by the Spanish government, he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car-ramming a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says that damage was caused to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone fired a crossbow at the car.
A play by Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was the winner.
Livingston, who had been promoted this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is only Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the neighbourhood club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's play made the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team moved up to the second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side, on the other hand, are still winless away from home in the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the leader, Hearts, who are eight points behind.
But before that, the Rangers are hosting the Vienna Rapid this Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends their unbeaten run to six games with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's not taking advantage of their chances in front of the visitors' live game.
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer well before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defence, but ruined his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then sent the ball out in a stretch to try to finish Craig Halkett's pass, which crossed the goal.
The locals were fine with letting the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could get the visitors in trouble on isolated plays.
And that's how this decisive goal came about.
The referee struck a foul against Rangers interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to give Menga a chance to strike first and finish from the centre of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but were met with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had little to do throughout the game,
The scene was repeated in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's shot with his feet and Lithgow deflected another Livingston combo.
Rangers were also charged with two penalties, one for an alleged Halkett inning to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for a hand, both of which were dismissed.
Livingston  phenomenal: an analysis of the work of the artist
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His playing style and personnel have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, although much of the credit must be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was overwhelmed, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to wait for Menga throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely failed to maintain the level.
They failed to create chances (only once they clearly outmatched the home defence), and this should be taken as a warning by Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
A warm welcome for Erdogan in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated because of issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it's the city that has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, though a large number of supporters flocked to the surrounding area to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, also made their voices heard as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion surrounding the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled a dictator by others.
Deptford road accident: a cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy area of Deptford, south-east of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a hit and run case on Childers Street, a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that their officers are working to identify the man and report the facts to the next of kin.
The street has been closed and bypasses have been applied to bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in a scuffle
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's penitentiary, according to the center's office.
The incident took place at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at around 9.30am on Sunday, local time, and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado agents were dispatched to the scene to put an end to the altercation, which involved eight inmates.
The officers had to be attended to for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to resolve an incident at Long Martin Prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees have had to be treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible for this altercation will be held accountable by the police and may have to spend even more time in jail.
The Long Lartin Penitentiary houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison's head had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, riot police officers were present at the prison to resolve a serious altercation in which the staff of the center was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with significant flooding (drought-prone areas could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that is precisely what is likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and take over Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a post that only eight tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile (322 km) radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was only 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where up to 150 mm would be recorded in Arizona's Mogollon.
Other desert areas in the southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could register 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of flood risk, the rain of the Rosa could be very good news, as the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could prove very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 87 mph (137 km/h), and is now located 620 mph (620 km/h) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 12 mph (20 km/h).
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, which is causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, 75 to 150 mm of rain totals are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm.
After that, Rosa will head northward crossing Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and finally crossing Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States", according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with battered clothes in Somerset.
The teen was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have issued a call for anyone who may have some sort of record of the events with their cell phone to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered the petty anger of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she sexually abused him decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in relation to his alleged.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public", he told the West Virginia sympathizers.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of the Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't run, but I actually do, he said.
That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats are engaging in "resistance and obstruction".
The first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place as late as Friday, a senior aide to Republican leaders has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many more have been swept away by giant waves crashing into beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves up to six meters high hit the coast toward dusk, dragging many of the people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast some 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came from Donggala, Nugroho says.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, which could unfortunately end up much worse", he says.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a video shared on social media by an amateur, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building giving desperate warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water breaks through the seashore, washing away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread power outages that have disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the military has started sending humanitarian aid in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, the evacuees are still in desperate need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami stands at over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees are sheltering in canvas shelters installed in their office courtyard, they had to witness scenes of utter destruction during the journey, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the heartbreaking gesture of starting relief efforts, some people complained that aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign fundraising, provisions and staffing can only begin to flow if the place where a catastrophe has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster", we can start asking for international assistance, but that level hasn't been declared yet.
As the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people held out hope for a miracle and for their loved ones to escape the devastating account of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a sinkhole.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse circulated among the parapente community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a double blue check mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received", he added.
Thieves steal $26,750 during the filling of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the release that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man es came running up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: To be formally known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us.
I went from Kanye, who means the one, to simply Ye, who is a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Combs has been known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has taken his nickname with or without hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country marks the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisals against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that "military force will never be used again to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for AI
"As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on AI research", says Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government have announced measures in the field of AI, despite the country's general lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the world is lagging behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI", Lee said.
"Doubling funding could double the chances of the U.S. achieving the next big AI discovery", Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that overtook the top-ranked American player in the Othello game, and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively evaluated previous US Government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
"Usually, American researchers have to work hard to get public grants", Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders; it's the companies".
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired eminent academics to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the US' work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think that permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI", he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest-generation artificial intelligence development plan.
China's National Natural Science Foundation grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the US Natural Science Foundation and other public bodies give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior to China's, Lee pointed out.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
And also, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Science Foundation, it currently allocates more than 100 million dollars a year to AI research.
Meanwhile, for months, no measures have been applied in relation to the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on changing the name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has barred it from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is questioning whether the minimum participation of 50% is reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means that we all will have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for it to join the European Union and NATO, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them head on, not through the back door", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will be accompanied by much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said before depositing his ballot.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean the "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum participation required.
According to the results of another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "yes".
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout has to be 50% plus one vote.
A failure to vote would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores after ramming through Brighton's defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were used to cancel Brighton's 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in what seemed like a ridiculously simple move.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He marched at speed through three Brighton defenses, slashing the ball as he came out of the way.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He bargained a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a stride to his left that found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball on first play, inside the area, to Agüero, who right-footed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that slipped into the inside right-field net.
"Agüero has foot pain", Pep Guardiola, the City manager, told reporters.
We decided that he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting lead in the Premier League battle.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
On that play, Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's court and
He made a beautiful pass in the space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before exiting through the backline.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, out of options, wants to eliminate the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, a very competitive pitcher, is hoping to get on the mound of the pitcher next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have any chance of making the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a home run with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win their first division title.
Even if we don't play, at least we can go out there knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably be playing every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
Why would I want to miss this game?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer pitch if that situation arises.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th opening, did a warm-up session Thursday and would pitch Sunday, on his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We have five weeks left before one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I don't introduce myself, but I actually do introduce myself. That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates", she said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, their meanness, their malice is evident.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control.
The Democrats' mission, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
And that's what you've seen over the last four days, he's been rebelling, and he's called the Democrats "dirty, mean, ugly, and fake".
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which prompted a strong public outcry.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... That was a very bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has to stop being a diverse party.
He's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the last of a long line of British MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, all for the sake of speaking our minds.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the no-confidence motion, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe -- ironically, these are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday nights have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if they ever existed, has long since been forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues who I thought shared a political vision with seemed to expect me to turn around and take positions I would never have taken, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing centre-left policies and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they do not get mad.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of no confidence or every change in the selection rules, the party is tightening up.
Over the last couple of years, I've received a lot of advice and I've been told to keep my head down, not be so expressive, and "Everything will be fine".
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, spurred on by the neglectful Thatcher government, which left my whole class literally in the dust, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or no political interest will prevent me from acting, in my view, in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's unsuccessful run to the top of the table
Two last-minute attempts distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this vibrant match of the day for the Tennent's Premiership.
Ayr, who are the only undefeated team in the top ten, occupy the top position in the table.
In the end, the home team won thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take advantage of opportunities better, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The games we have played so far have tested us and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, opined: "Happy for the Ayres, they have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have".
A 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, given away by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical lead and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just at halftime, scored and converted a try to put the score 17-5 in Ayr's favour at the break.
But the Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was then interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on the bench, and at the start Ayr extended the distance again with a Stafford McDowall shot converted by Climo.
Subsequently, alternate captain Blair Macpherson was cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of a man's superiority with a further unconverted try from Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card for tackling Climo without a ball, from the penalty line-up, MacPherson scored a counter-hit behind the penetrative Ayres' goal.
Climo scored, as he had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe collected a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-string winger Gregor Henry to score the fifth try for the home team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be about to embark on a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be on the verge of making the leap into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he had been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan had been intending to enter Glasgow's "thriving restaurant sector".
The sea is ours: Landless Bolivia hopes court reopens route to Pacific
The sailors patrol their deck-launched naval vessel in La Paz.
Public buildings are flown with a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are empastifiable with the motto: "The sea is ours by right".
To get it back is a duty.
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as does the longing to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it is waiting with a positive attitude for the result", pointed out Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the TIJ ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obligated to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a contentious battle for reelection next year, also has high hopes for Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised last August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that, if it does, things will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ's resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were presented, indicates that the case "was not complicated", Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has kept the issue of access to the sea secret", Zárate said.
"Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile", he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a pipe dream to think that continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War can ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang makes significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized bar-houses, from the road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the catwalk a range of extravagant, disproportionately sized caps from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical bars, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's signature piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, lead-shaped wing, which flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were cotton candy, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extra-fashion masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-end.
One creation looked like a complete scuba diving kit, with a tube and goggles, while another looked like a cone of ice fog.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that huge bouquets could be rolling into the main streets near you.
The oversized hats step on the heels of la Bomba, a two-foot wide, straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the unpractical hat that went viral on social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a beach straw bag, almost as big as the bathing suit-clad model wearing it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia serrels and finished with a white leather sleeve, was the highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see people wearing big beach gowns and beach bags on the main streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizenship
Scottish independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued into 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for their chosen career and for their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you get into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examinations, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received the A-plus grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained an A-plus qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the fact that it was difficult for them to fill vacancies, 17% was attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more potential job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% did not know a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important jobs.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he or she will always be able to choose from a range of languages at the independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In today's global business environment, it is undeniable that languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered 'international communicative competencies'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
You have to do it right.
John Edward is headmaster of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But the minutes he'll play are still to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, the Lakers' play-by-play announcer, tweeted that James will likely play for a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready", he blurted out.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a wave of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings Trump is scheduled to hold next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump is aiming to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia rally can be watched online at the link below, via YouTube live video streaming.
Trump is likely to tackle the hearing this week of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been strained by the sexual abuse allegations he faces, as the expected Senate confirmation vote is held up for a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans who are running for the delicate November election gain momentum.
So, the five meetings of the Trump campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a busy campaign season", said a Trump spokesman who declined to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is running unfavorably in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows ambition to keep hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles matches
After three unequal sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging dynamic pendulum is a made-up sporting concept, one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So what side is the positive dynamic on now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're in a little bit of a positive streak", Jordan Spieth declared as he walked away at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has a lead, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind blowing a little in their favor and have many reasons to be excited, largely because of the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from the tee to the green and is setting an example.
The guttural cries of celebration intensified as he continued his lap and he put in a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been down two holes.
He celebrated the winning putt on the 15th hole with a similar shout, the kind that indicates he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party", Spieth pointed out.
It's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple are four out of four and they make no mistakes.
The Moliwoods were the only couple who did not make a Saturday afternoon bogey, and also avoided the Saturday morning and Friday afternoon bogey, and the final nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow in and out of the boisterous crowd, it is reaffirmed that it is the players who beat Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, to talk about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly finished off with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any chance of getting out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch because of the interactions between the devices, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change all of a sudden.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the final day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, had questioned.
Europe reaches the Ryder Cup final with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after ending Saturday's four-ball and four-somes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went to great lengths to score two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and set their record, so far, at four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was aiming to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs and put the series at 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in 12 Sunday individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After slamming Woods and Patrick Reed on fourballs, they put on a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning's fourballs, was paired again with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe was not all that far away on a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new record for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They won a decisive 2 to 1 victory against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at fourballs and later won back over Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 to 3 at foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team won back-to-back four-point games, although Furyk's defending champions need only draw to retain the title.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack next Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm  at all unless signs of trust are seen
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying their mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any response in line with the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.
While Ri took up North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearisation approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps step by step, his remarks seemed significant in that he did not reject full unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearization must occur first and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, as well as opposing the declaration of the end of the war, Ri noted.
The perception that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader outlined at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stalemate".
However, Ri's tone was very different from his speech last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Mr. Evil Trump dubbed Kim Rocket Man on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament action, but said that much more needs to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearises.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm complete and final denuclearization".
The Security Council has been pushing sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "consonant action".
He said Kim had told him that the "consistent measures" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of caffeinated, all-night studying.
One academic observed that often the world's top university students are distracted by the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
And at the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, reported The Telegraph.
The course, which was first implemented this year, teaches students the basics of how good sleep habits improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a dorm room, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, beds and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance on sleep deprivation, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of suffering heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
We know that student behavior won't change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are under make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Ensuring good quality sleep for long periods of time should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into a starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blâllâ emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The goal from Menga ends Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 home defeat at Livingston that is another stumbling away.
Ibrox were looking to pick up their first home win since their 4-1 win at St Johnstone last February, but Gary Holt's side inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave his side adrift, 8 points adrift of the Hearts, the unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the score.
While Rangers now sit in sixth place, Livingston have moved up to third, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence required medical attention for a head injury caused by an object apparently being thrown from the bleachers.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same starting eleven that picked up a point against Hearts last week, and he certainly felt satisfied with the way his well-organised team suffocated their rivals at every turn.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the second minute of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone against Allan McGregor, but the midfielder shot off and squandered the big opportunity.
A hard-hitting foul from Keaghan Jacobs hit captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot on the back post.
The Rangers were made with the control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty at the fifteen-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless hit, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only ran two shots on goal in the first half, but Ibrox's first-choice goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with the head-butt of Lassana Coulibaly and the docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it for their effort alone.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't match Jacobs' well-crafted play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted out the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had a virtually immediate impact, as the end made a pass to Morelos, though the imposing Kelly ran into the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of the visitors by playing exactly as they pleased, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's side could have given up the lead in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a shutout from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still called a last-minute penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson got his eyes wide open.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the Geiger computer.
The Geiger counter, a mainstay of science ever since, also became a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed vaquero physicists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from the radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "It's sure to be popping right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can take a protein that's common to many cancers and then re-inject it
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with several types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear after more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A.: "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein "favours the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and teaching these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West went on a pro-Trump rant with a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written off on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance congratulating US President Donald Trump and saying he would run in the 2020 election.
After her third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again cap, she began to criticize Democrats and reiterate her support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump if he's a racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over the allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not treated well backstage because of the hat he wore.
"I was threatened from behind the scenes.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I was besieged.
And then they say I'm in an inferior position", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying he would put on the Superman cape so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love".
His comments drew public scorn at least twice and the show's crew seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole studio was completely silenced".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West left much of the audience baffled with his performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West won the backing of TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR STARING IN THE MULTITUD".
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so are we".
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "the former Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince was renamed for a symbol and, subsequently, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in west Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has come out in the open about toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for portraying the role of Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of the virile hero, saying that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine from The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was wondering how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he is feeling strongly about tackling this issue.
"Personally, I now wonder where we went wrong about masculinity", he says.
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added: What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it about TV and the streets that makes young boys feel they have to have this side of manhood?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: How do we change that?
Because something is definitely wrong with the young guys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, all while saying that he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
"I met my wife on the show, so it gave me my future family and my life going forward", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike what was happening in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China from infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV from this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who engage in homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many disease transmissions are due to the lack of proper precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators and debunks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to the Wikipedia for lawmakers pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a session of the Senate committee on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and that it revealed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Capitol reported.
"This groundless allegation is completely false and a pure lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent reports was not responsible in any way for this leak of information.
This groundless allegation is completely false and a pure invention".
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation", Fleischer wrote.
"So you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not become angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and composed".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if it is true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed", he continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for any actions they have taken that have harmed each and every one of my staff".
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again: a parody of the limited spy by Rowan Atkinson
It's a tradition to look for Brexit references in any new film with a British focus, and this remake of the Johnny English parody action-comedy franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satire about how despicable we are will be a new opportunity for the country's export?
In any case, the glittering-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been able to renew his license to mess things up for a second time.
Evidently, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of glamorous glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveller Atkinson who represented the now forgotten television advertisements for Barclaycard, where he was spreading chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last JE trip.
I loved Johnny English, who sat in a helicopter in medieval armor, and the leaves of the helix were hanging from his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the humor seems pretty fluid and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as witty or focused as the silent gags of Atkinson's Mr. Bean character.
The recurringly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the consternation of the service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and haunted figure, who already suffers a total collapse from lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Teresa-May-like character, but the script doesn't go any further.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some high-end institution, but giving off-the-books classes on how to be an undercover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequester Bough, a role that Ben Miller reprises.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little underused.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in His Majesty's secret service go into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous antics: disguised as waiters, they set a French fast food restaurant on fire, cause chaos by smuggling contraband aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes a major confusion by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly taken from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything together seems like a children's program.
Just like normal things.
As with other Johnny English films, it has been no help to wonder if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan to have the British have a four-day working week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
Supposedly, the party wants company bosses to pass on the savings gained from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them one more holiday.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek has the backing of the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to take advantage of the economic change.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits in the party's perspective of "balancing the economy in favor of the worker" and in the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this joint aspiration at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
The Minister in the Cabinet John McDonnell used the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell voiced his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that shareholders of the water companies might not recover the full investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for perceived wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms' shares to employees, who expect to bag up annual dividends worth up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring to light anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean it", said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the allegations came out, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, and confident".
But Graham's vote seems to be burned.
"I have my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people you nominate can verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing again".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely stunning program of stars, who are carrying out an equally stunning mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather on the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years left to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just another case of what we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded over 19 million "actions" by its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 trillion, which will have impacted the lives of over 2.250 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion had already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that protected funds have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major pledges include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and entrepreneurs, which pledges to "help children grow as much as possible" and pledges to send $35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote of history", The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after over 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and hard road. Sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy as "blockade" to hinder Russian energy exports (Home Secretary)
Washington can, "if necessary", use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is their willingness to trade energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern pan of Europe", he allegedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's negotiating strategies with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are effectively equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels", he said, while pointing out that Russia only has one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says made Berlin "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the opinion that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to step back from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI (Federation of German Industries), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "think hard" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think hard" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to hold high office", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and claimed that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "it's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election".
However, a poll released Thursday showed a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the nomination.
The poll revealed broader support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the PTSD-affected Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"With what my own son is going through since he returned, I can sympathize with other families who are suffering the ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers come back with", he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans: "They come a little different, they come bold, they come wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Nineteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawsuit in the case Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the violent gang member's children" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers in states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine stated Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those people who leave their country because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her feverish son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water".
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to grab flooded belongings and try to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, battered by the 7.5 magnitude quake, are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital as patients are being treated outside due to the repeated heavy shaking.
Tears welled up in his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're well".
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing itself with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper touting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed the China Daily paid supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, last Wednesday after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US elections marked what US officials have told Reuters as a new phase in Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to put ads in to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports soar.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "is redoubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press".
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate opinions Chinese citizens may have about China's worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but did not name the publication.
Republicans are cutting women's votes before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Sen. Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be off the charts", explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've been tall before; they've been tall.
But it could have been more, especially among women voters from the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who often don't vote while they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault claims against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a negative response could result if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become an impasse for the GOP", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford star and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with the balance shifting slightly toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony to be undoubted or probable, while 35 percent say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony to be undoubted or probable.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same of Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the claims filed by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while she was 17 under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the emerging firm.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which are available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether we need to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely void overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission".
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Victoria Cross of the I GM
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the VC on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense gun and machine gun fire".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "the utmost courage" he advanced the line before throwing himself on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night watching Bellator 206 and being denied the chance to see the most important event.
The San José card contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and was to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00pm, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, UK viewers were stunned when the programme was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted at having stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a kind of vomit-sucking sound".
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on the programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the repetition, I think it can work", Coker said.
"But there it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're gonna leave it at five fights, instead of the usual six, and we tried to re-show it for the fans, but it ended.
It is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Records: Tom Daley felt he was "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had made it less important to him to win the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on the first Laverne show, said she felt "less than" the others because she was "not as socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, they were real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so as not to disappoint anyone when she eventually discovered her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that she had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "took us by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
According to him, when you go through this when you're young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
"If you'd asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold", he said.
"There are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he should die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'Dad, you're not going to be there to occupy the front row,'" she said.
"As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that I was dead, that I finally accepted that he was invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There was no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired the choice of her first song (Proud by Heather Small), which she had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still gave her goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
A worsened Mickelson showed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unfortunate figure.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the limelight, as has been customary for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments splits his time between cheerleading and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish the deviated shots.
And if his own track record isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, will face the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of this week's matches.
If the Americans, four points down in their opening 12 games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role for the day perfectly, slapped me on the back and put his arm around me while telling me he would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that has not equaled his own individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, jokes, likes to make fun of people and is a great teammate", she explained.
I think the younger players also had fun fucking him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings a lot more to the table than his game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage can be erased soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the singles matches of the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won the victory by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a little bit", said Bjorn, in the image, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 in Le Golf National.
History has taught me and every member of the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go full speed ahead.
You have to go out there and do it right.
This isn't over until the points are on the board.
We have one goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do that.
I've said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have on the team, but I'm also presenting who our rivals are: the best players in the world.
Delighted with his players' performance on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything's going well, but individual duels really test your golf ability.
That's the message you're gonna give the players, make the best of yourself tomorrow.
At that point, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best of himself, too.
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day's races, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the Miracle of Medinah that won Europe.
"I remember all the words exactly", he said when asked how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, and his players before the final day.
We've got 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start off on a good foot, like we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When you have a team that's inspired, it puts a lot of pressure on those central duels.
We have prepared the lineup based on the circumstances and the best way to try to make magic tomorrow.
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the backlash against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities", Bjorn says of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new battleship, postponed again
The German Navy's new frigate was supposed to be completed in 2014 to replace the Cold War era warships, but won't be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems following construction have put an end to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth-countermeasures technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other prominent features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuing delays mean that the forward-developing ships, which were expected to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they go into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss drassana in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder once it had been delivered.
Little is known of the reasons for her return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered her unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the older Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, the ship's weight has also been found to be excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" will weigh twice as much as similar-class vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from the faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if recent warnings are to be taken into account that Germany's naval power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, has acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships that can be used.
The official has claimed that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were discontinued, but no new ones were provided as replacements.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new study on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
It is hoped that the findings will provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The National Trust of Scotland scientists will be studying soprano and common bats, as well as northern earwigs and water bats at Inverewe Botanic Garden, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Experts' analysis of the sound recordings will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the UK has declined considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do mosquito netting paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten properly trained experts, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here in Threave, we have a large area for bats", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
But there are still many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow".
He points out the importance of checking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them, and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to step forward to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of some of our own species, we don't have enough data on their population".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and has claimed that people want to become famous thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 to keep the incident from becoming public, according to the news published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just trying to get a good look.
What they said today, fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to be famous because of my name.
It's only natural.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order", added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have described as "unacceptable information of suspicion about privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral harm" in an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most egregious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to reports filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a 99% good boy, except for a 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed for Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "always regret it" if it lost its status as the world's leading manufacturer after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU with no agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU will work has sparked fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is done on a 'just-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for automotive manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be riots at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We have to come to an agreement, we want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not just to enjoy the success that we have, but to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains".
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long the production would be halted, but, in the long term, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, has claimed that members are starting to be very worried about the situation: "From experience, when you lose these jobs, you never get them back".
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be backfiring.
Donald Trump's highly anticipated meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by a week as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and Trump aid, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller's independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of impeaching the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump has stated that he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied as follows: "No date has been set yet, it could be this week, although it may be delayed a week more by all the issues with the supreme court.
But we'll see, I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not made a single White House briefing since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of briefings was not because he did not like the bragging of television journalists, though he said: "I will not deny that they are bragging".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, before adding the following without citing any source: "We have consulted these data".
Sanders has stated that briefings will continue to take place, but if the press has the ability to question the president of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and they'll replace the briefings when you get to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press releases are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and, at times, bizarre appearance in front of the assembled press.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at the Scottish National Health Service over Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of residency applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following:  During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also started preparations in case of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a turbulent time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, while benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers running back Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the press that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a litter and taking him away for further testing.
An official from Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris, of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is Abercrombie's first season as a sophomore with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making it a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty on buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help the homeless under the Conservative Party's new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay UK tax.
Hisenda hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty on purchases of UK property and this money will be used to help the homeless, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to lure young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The stamp duty increase will be levied on those individuals and businesses that do not pay UK tax; this money will be allocated to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and real estate speculations, could be as high as 3%.
The tax office expects to collect up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are owned by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up at the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people get their first homes.
He accused the large developers of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable housing to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and ending no-fault evictions.
It also wants to give more power to the municipalities to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: a better life for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be correct that it is equally easy for people outside the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the undignity of homelessness makes it all the more real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "greatest ambition" is to be Scotland manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, has accepted the challenge of reviving the north-east club, who currently occupy the third position in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called up once as a back-up and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it's always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I am successful coaching clubs, but 
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. He was also the coach of the Sunderland senior team from the 1990s to the 2010s.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he does not feel the pressure of being next in a list of established names in such a big team, after having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Right now, my criterion for measuring my success is whether I can get this team back into the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League, he said.
It's not easy to get there, but I'd only consider myself successful here if I can get the club back.
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as second-in-command at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a decisive moment", he recalled about accepting the post at the Allowa.
I always thought that training was my strongest suit, rather than playing.
It's weird because I did it right, I got out reasonably and I had a pretty good time.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to get over every week.
I still struggle with aspects of it like the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've felt since I was an adult.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has boosted consumption in Britain's struggling bars, but has added more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and chain bars saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant consumption fell by 4.8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, from the financial consultancy CGA, the company that collected the data, says the following: "Continuous sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been extended longer than expected, have caused July to follow a similar pattern to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have had the best results, while consumption in restaurants has been declining.
Food bars have also been hit by the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, from the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Timing and the impact of large social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to outdoor leisure market sales.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, but a decline in sales of 4.8% year-over-year would be especially damaging, more so than continued cost pressures.
This long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide this much-needed respite.
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including recently opened ones, was 2.7% in July, indicating the slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's leading sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over £9 million and is the established benchmark for the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to survey data.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students claim to have a "principal account" that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid rise in "fake Instagram accounts", a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a "principal" account that they show to their parents, while also having a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Committee (HMC), has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of athletes' at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as a non-executive director on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her extensive experience internationally over the last decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its inclusion in the directive", said Beattie.
Doyle has stated the following: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland".
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, among a total of four Olympic bears and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted the following: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I could recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today is the day of agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
A flip-flop ad comparing seas to cows divides opinion on the Internet
One company that distributes baby labels has created a rift in opinion on the Internet by comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "world's first silent, wearable wipes", consumer technology company Elvie has released an advertisement inspired by a music video joke to show the freedom the new wipes give mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics like: Yes, I munyo to myself, but you will not see any que and In case you hadn't noticed, they are not braggers, but my tits.
The cycle continues: "Bomber, bomber, feed the babies, bomber, bomber, feed the girls".
However, the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reaction from those who have seen it, many of whom claim that it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth", wrote one person.
The Elvie cloth is discreetly concealed in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented as follows: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a flip-flop for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: "It's an out of place ad".
Others defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "funny".
I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to suckle.
Pumping for the dump made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but you have to take it for what it is.
It's a great product", wrote one user.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad targeted at mothers who are pumped with wipes (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like they're cows).
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the sash discreetly placed on the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they wear the headband.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and early childhood developer, has stated the following: "Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the audience how to use a wristband and the challenges that come with doing so, while demonstrating, in a fun and educational way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new wristband offers.
This isn't the first time that the Elvie rag has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, quietly moved to a tented camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children being held has increased even though monthly inflows across the border have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid of putting their chances of staying in the country at risk if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults living in their homes will have to submit digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80% of people who have hosted or are living in the home of a host are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people", Albence declared.
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not deemed fit for aid will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to workers and reports the system has released in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where the size of the facility makes it more likely that signs of a child's suffering will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges 'occupying forces' from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year-old war.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has claimed that foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war on terror is virtually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said that Damascus would continue "fighting this holy battle until we have purged all of Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "irrational reasons" that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They are politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has fostered the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will confront the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, and "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin drafting a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
Which would undoubtedly be the end of the most dramatic presidency in history.
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television viewership with up to 3.5 million viewers in prime news nights.
"People have been so upset because they don't understand it", says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when a bombing destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cabbie told him he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said it was because it made him laugh, he called me Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV shows, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is about going beyond the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's "private" resources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket (a piece of clothing that's as thick as his pride, The Washington Post headlines) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' gruesome descriptions of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like it's part of a reality show is that every night gives you something new", says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and script twists of Trump's show (fuck the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, it was about 75 degrees and sunny outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he stayed in his room watching MSNBC while CNN was taping.
He couldn't get out of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money floods the races of the mid-term elections to the House of Representatives more tightly
It's no surprise that there's a flood of cash in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has two current members competing for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburg involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the parties' main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a closely watched special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held the office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political pundits give the Democrats a slight advantage.
United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent "decisions to cease recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 aid from the United States of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements, was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be damaging to the Central American country and the high murder and unemployment death rates.
With the pace of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year and seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from making their way to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on it, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, which included two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the record.
An outside analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
He studied history
The next event to occur could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and, even, in front of a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the downfall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, but only if the Western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and we lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates at turning points like this and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing several turning points right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bind since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein claims the information in the Times is not accurate.
How do we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will start to be threatened.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the game against Vienna Rapid
Rangers take on Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at home to Real this month, would put them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villa, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Real are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We played the game thinking we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
We could have taken something else out of it in the end, but, overall, probably the fourth was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second half.
On Thursday, it is another big European night.
We hope to get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last match, but I'm sure we will give it all and we will get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I sustained and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, put the past season behind us and have success.
Women lose sleep for fear of saving for retirement
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with their family.
Approximately half of the respondents nationally said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want to have a family member take care of them, but they don't dare ask for it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: they can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal papers, cut through the legal battles.
Find a representative so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals will honor your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also obtaining a power of attorney for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of disability.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
He specifies these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finances are not the only factor that should be determined, but also which doctors you want to treat", said Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready".
Man shot several times with a air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times by a compressed air gun while returning home after a night out.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'Officers have described the shooting, which occurred at around 2.30am (UK time), as a "random act".

His life is not in danger from his injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
As communications are cut, the relief units have been unable to obtain information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Cèlebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Cèlebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Celebes Island.
The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an approximate population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Cèlebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 a tsunami also occurred in western Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur frequently.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake rocked a populated area of Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocks one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroys dozens of villages and kills some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled the phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su provisional detention center, where he is being held on a 500 USD unsecured bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he pleaded, according to this channel.
Palin faces three Class A felonies, which means she could face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify them of the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner testified that he punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking an extraordinary death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - an extraordinary penalty that hasn't been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists during his commute in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offenses could carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in mob cases, in addition to one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors claimed that the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police explained that he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be unfurled in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 misdemeanors.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a plea of guilty and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has claimed that politicians should "feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs has suggested that she should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP without a seat Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks was highlighted when pro-union Conservatives showed up at another anti-Brexit protest in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan between attacks from Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The allies insist that they will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure the Eurosceptics and the Conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Solihull Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd already be out,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo the Chequers commitment".
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed its mind and wants to stay is totally false".
The Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, listen to the people".
"Checkers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who go out into the streets and get us to win an election.
Abandon the commitment of Chequers and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said that the politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to bring back the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to bring about Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we won't allow it".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, she added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure".
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, union supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners about the anti-Brexit Conservatives after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative House of Lords member Lord Adonis laughed at the Tories for the security problems they suffered with a party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is planning to consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open house in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as a deputy chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been the focus of speculation about the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An aide asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the dome".
One person arrested in the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET news conference.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, and he was finally killed", police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media outlet 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after team orders handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas got ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits early and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes later had to pit and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a certain wheel-to-wheel action which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free at the risk of being out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and moving into fourth position.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the next eight laps and Raikkonen was placed in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to get a U-two", said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "wicked, cruel and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry, mean, cruel and lying people", he said.
"When you look at the communications and the leaks and they say, 'No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember his response -- did you leak the document?
No, I won't.
I didn't filter it through".
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked it... No, we didn't leak it", she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's anti-Kavanaugh statements in July and it leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein explained to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to".
But his denial didn't please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements for their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite against the Belfast Giants as they won the return leg 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were immediately outscored by two goals, thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the bar for their team, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who were coming off a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist by Kendall McFaull.[4] Four minutes later, with an assist from David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this initial hectic period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first period when he scored the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The local team regrouped and, once again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and play their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies while rescuing hundreds of passengers from an earthquake-prone plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has become a hero after he died to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are many aftershocks occurring in the area and there are many people trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his seat in the shaky control tower of Palu Mutiara Six Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the tarmac at the time, could take off safely.
Then he walked out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This has broken our hearts", she added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed", said agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves, up to six metres high, have devastated Palu, which will hold a joint funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-cars have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working around the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all who are working day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after the crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that was to crash in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing, though it previously said all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, as of Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities reported Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The exact cause of the accident and sequence of events is still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane grounded in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe the plane went over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was flying very low.
"This was extremely positive", Jaynes stated.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water up their waists to the plane's emergency exits, which were sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a pier also assisted in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people to shore before the plane sank about 100 feet (30 m) into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in accidents of airliners registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution wrapped up the case Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to construct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, since his van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and bring conscious hip-hop back into the fashions.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from the hand of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues a couple for divorce after a "racist" post
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO ONE OTHER BLACK PERSON", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message, which was sent to her by email.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After becoming aware of her infatuation, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, all claiming that the nanny she had dismissed, who was African American, had done her job poorly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received her day's pay and was later driven home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is claiming compensation for the couple's dismissal and is asking for compensation of approximately $350 USD per day for the six-month residency work for which they had hired her, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that", he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to the claims of being racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", said the husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have had a crush, even if it was by mistake?
A child?
Come with me".
Plasco, who has likened the lawsuit to "extortion", said his wife was two months away from having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after something like that?
It's not a very nice attitude", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still unresolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who first read it before its publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success".
She explained that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little stuffed bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection.[citation needed] She also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet", following his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and he says that his father was very proud of him, of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your son gets something: you're proud, even if it's not your own.
I think he saw Paddington's success as that.
Though it was his own creation and his own imagination, I always used to acknowledge Paddington's own merit".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called frequently to say that it was very difficult and that they did not expect him to get over it", commented Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said he was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medication that had been given to keep her body beating was being used up and being drained out of her system.
He died before he was supposed to, and it all went out.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep my manners".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distraught by the experience.
"No one knew", she said.
"I had a headache and tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for overwhelming Snow White.
The feeling that he needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much".
Grief-stricken women hanging postcards to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at age 18, committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chief with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile could light up any room".
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark spot".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis stated, "I am continually concerned that there is a side effect".
Ms. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people they can turn to, that they can listen, even if it's a friend.
You must not be silent, you must speak".
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a long-time friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said that he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
It hit a peak on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
He said that his death would be a great trauma for them, but that they have to work on it: "It opens a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His hesitation has to do with the moment.
With just five weeks to go until the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans do not get a good result, they will see weakness in getting the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been taking phone calls to senators and pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falls' with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in prices charged to human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Sources in Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historian" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "historian" and that his temper makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been called a 'hysteric,'" Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes shouting and speechless as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and said the charges against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" staged by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was reluctant when asked if she would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"This is what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but you're not qualified to be on the court where you are now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Superior Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into the courtroom and expect us to think it's wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women have to exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of raging fury and cannot bring it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. What about you?"
She went on... "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started to cry, saying to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then I would go on.
It seemed brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for rage in part because, basically, they're misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once ended up crying in unimaginable rage, is that of an older woman (a management cold who had always terrified me a little) who grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the foot of the ladder.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself as a presidential candidate.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he told me laughingly 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody called it "Blancaneu and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't enter the race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who had given $1,000 to men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and targeting voters instead of delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was speechless.
"You might have thought she was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, 'What will they put on my grave?'
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial rumblings of the US-China trade war were deafening and while the war does not appear to be ending anytime soon, a distancing of the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed tariffs on China's main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, which means that half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China will be taxed.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way every time and recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has committed to catch up with the U.S. and it's not likely that the world's second largest economy will be doing so anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back off means giving in to some demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the U.S. could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a collapse in either country is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Affairs Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are fulfilled.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that funded the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's national team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States national team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought through most of the tournament, threw the opening shot to water at the par 3 16 hole, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his series and became one of four players to have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off with a 5&4 by the less qualified European player Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup winner, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's biggest winner ever, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup back.
The team is the most important thing... and I'm happy to have been able to help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to fellow American John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players to ever play the game, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the routes, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
There was a moment this morning when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We're going to regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
He's gonna have to take off his hat.
We have been defeated".
