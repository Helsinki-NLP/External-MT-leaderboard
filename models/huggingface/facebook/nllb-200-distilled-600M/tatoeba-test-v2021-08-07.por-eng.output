While I was traveling through Europe, they stole my wallet from a train.
White: tower on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawn on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. White puts the opponent on zugzwang by throwing the tower on a6, after which black will have only two options: take the tower on a6 or throw their bishop to any other house of the b8-h2 diagonal. In the first case, white advances their pawn from b6 to b7 and mates. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pawn of a7, with the same result.
