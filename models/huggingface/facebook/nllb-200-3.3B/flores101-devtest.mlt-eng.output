USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute necessity of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making progress through significant change within our organisation, rather than by removing certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already widely accepted, but provides details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The scientists state that the face of this animal was brown to chestnut in colour at the top and the bottom is light or carotenoid colour.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of the ray in birds.
Because dinosaur rays do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but have other features of rixbarbs and barbules researchers have concluded that rachis was likely an evolutionary development that occurred after these other features.
The structure of the tail suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows adult tail and not the thin, soft tail of the young.
The researchers suggested that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not the fur of a felus.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killing two police officers and wounding more than 20 others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic recoil.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the St. Ann's Lane.
Just as the Moon has a pull on the Earth, causing tides, so too the St. Anna's Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dark matter affects other dark matter as regular matter does.
This theory says that the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of dyadema and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters lock themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice on an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter's name list.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of the duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness all parts of the process.In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering her son.
She is in custody pending her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be influenced by the fact that her photograph has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be putting themselves in danger by publishing photographs and other images of suspicious persons".
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of prosecutions, indicated to journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the disclosure, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine must base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other subjects covered reported include the future status of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel calls for a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to allow such a presence for five years only.
The additional test shooters for pest control had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers have been recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's (SSA) sport shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Director of Parks and Heritage Conservation with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly elected a new provisional electoral council (CEP) of 19 members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP (Provisional Electoral Council) in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Some 60 cases of iPods damaged by overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan said it had been informed of the 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the postponement of the report by Apple "very regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Marianas North Emergency Management Office said there were no reported injuries in the nation.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a Tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle in the direction of the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographer later took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He trained as a gynaecologist and started working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if administered hormone this accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lung.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators found two 'black boxes' of flight recorders.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Truly unique as she was. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was unusual like me...maybe even more so than me...I love her and miss her...hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed agree with this view, and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the vote, 29 per cent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but his complaints raised doubts about his fitness.
He was unable to take the medication needed for his pain as it is banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number by 25 January.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water supply to the world along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially the Earth, since comets have collided with the Earth many years ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the loss as "words and political stupidity".
He is speculated to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to identify aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No extra transport is being put in and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transport have raised the possibility that the match will be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted much longer, due to mating between an endemic Darwin's sponge, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant sponge, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape.It can be rolled into small molds.
It can be drawn in a thin wire, which can then be ground and polished.
It can be made very thin, and attached to another metal.It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for drawing hand-drawn pictures in books called 'illuminated manuscripts'.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed from them (since the Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
The two children are then dried together and then, with wet and clean hands, put them in a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will shrivel up and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in almost every house, coupled with a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of drainage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, ancient Persia and ancient China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met together in mixed company.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and subsequently reflects it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because Earth's atmosphere partially obscures our light and vision.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet long is needed to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in countless ways. The biggest thing it has done for us is it has given us easier and faster transport.
He brought with him the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat the medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic free-ranging cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, frogs and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the nest, a special task each cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called prides.
The groups (prides) are made up of one to three related adult males, plus a maximum of thirty females and young.
Women are generally closely related to each other, as they are a large family of brothers and sisters.
Ions groups act like groups of puppies or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behaviour, and are also very fatal to their prey.
A good all-round athlete, the tiger can run (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, the only four cats that can bark loudly.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a sentence of awkwardly voiced words.
The ocelots are known to eat small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that ocelots track down prey by scent, by touching the ground where they are.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move with speed, too. Oselotes hunt their prey by blending with their surroundings then leaping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they move over a range of mountains or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back) they often find themselves in a different environment from that in which they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor instead of what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will not even be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants create the oxygen that humans breathe in, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, and therefore was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long roof was covered with over 70 sharp teeth, as well as a set of long-scrubbed roofs, meaning that anyone who came across it had no chance of escape.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue. Its diet included sea cucumbers, cod, other reptiles, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to defeat it.
While the majority of their food is familiar to us, the Romans actually had a number of festive items that were strange or unusual, including wild boar, pagoda, bats, and a type of rodent-like rodent that sleeps a lot.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their meals seated on the chairs, the rich men enjoyed a communal feast where they sat on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include the food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no wheat, tomatoes, potatoes, or coconuts, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turnip.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods that was considered the house of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in the temple and, behind it, an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the goddess.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were simply open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland had a small population. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you saw the movie "National Treasure", you might think there was a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its history, the large parchment-made document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added merely as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated the North of France, but the South still remained unfree.
It was led by the French "Vichy", who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded the South of France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large and significant group of people living and working cooperatively, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin words civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and which in a certain way also defines the size of society.
Cities as states are the precursors of nations.Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge from several generations, a persistent cultural imprint and a fair spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government in which Congress was its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities to enforce all its acts but, often, they were uncooperative.
He had no power to override the laws of taxation and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) and, therefore, this makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the early 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southern Taiwan, and begins a transformation in aboriginal wheat production practices and employs Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the coastal areas of Western and Northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Much of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a clearer idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the closing days of the analogue film era.
It is still produced today but, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the highest ratio of a simple whole number) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to this aspect ratio, or very similar to it.
The much abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
This states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image in three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become lordly and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has held the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His great power affected everyone from the king to the common peasant.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church has been Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, stopping vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade broke generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has drawn up international waters to prevent ships from entering whole sections of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to prevent a future repeat of such a situation.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four pennies to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each stage of China and each family holding power were distinctive dynasties.
There was also a period of instability between the dynasties, with the provinces divided, the most notable of these periods being the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods of time there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the top seat in the grand palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution, jobs were opened to all male applicants and this allowed the most ambitious and capable to succeed.
The same goes for the military because instead of being based on rank, the army classifications were now based on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to dig a cave that became known as Hira on the Mountain of Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, clearly shows the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On the top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if someone knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except a clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World to survive to the present day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small crypts, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, crypts and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The 'upper edge' mark appears as a V and the 'lower edge' mark as a steeple or square shape without the underside.
'L' means that you should start at the tip and push the bow, and 'L' means that you should start at the ring (the place where you are holding the bow) and pull the bow.
The upward beat of a stringed instrument generates a softer sound, while the downward beat is louder and more assertive.
You can make any mark you want with the pencils, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason and so, normally, they must be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a violent mob of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of angry people and shouted threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
One of the crowd beheaded the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the Queen who was in disgrace.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay off the bulk of the expenses and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The High Middle Epoch was preceded by the Early Middle Epoch and followed by the Late Middle Epoch, which is generally agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological push or the technological imperative to a narrow sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The ownership of the mass of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed individuals and, over time, resulted in customs and culture related to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of western Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until around 1100 A.D.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices that were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, because communication channels are slow, styles in the West can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fold clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture undertaken for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using native-raised seeds for the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically many farmers were involved in subsistence agriculture and this is still applicable in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel rejected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by using a different and symbolic style, including manners, manners, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialisation is to use a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misbehaviour or intentional abuse, were not socialised by adults while growing up.
Such children are called 'ferals' or 'savages'.Some feral children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the parents' rejection of the child's serious intellectual or physical impairment.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been bred from animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully domesticated by non-human animals, the wild boar exhibits behaviour (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the particular animals it has domesticated, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the learning method called scaffolding is more effective.
Iscaffolding is not a learning method but, rather, a support to provide support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold but even the little man of the paper clips in Microsoft Office is a scaffold.
Virtual Scaffolding is internalised in the software and aims to find, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, to even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but it still happens.
We consider the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home that were taken from it before.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and satisfactions.
For example, learning and socialization have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continued relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, the surface movements that last a few seconds.
In particular, it is said that one can tell if a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his document 'The President's Speech', showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of mental disability are, however, able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such skills in interpreting human behavior also exist in animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a human-like digestive system would find it difficult to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the accessible proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are well fed.
In contrast, animal feed (snails, termites, baits) is not only easily digestible, but provides a high quantity of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees living in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process where you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period and fall asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet rattle that wakes you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will make you get out of bed to get up.
Other biorhythm-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (notably water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, thus forcing the person to get up to pass urine.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated to the amount of tension in the person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of present life. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
Everyone can become enlightened.The only obstacle to this is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were enriched by the path of love of mahayana and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
As a principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the idea that love accepts everything.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (luminous energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga. Through the visualization of several gods one clears the energy channels, activates the chakras and creates a consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was still common in World War II, and led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war the lack of agreement in the system, the process and the culture led to the countries fighting.
Just two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and was to be fought in earnest, by alternative armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became almost overnight obsolete, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the borders of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War, in which the Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mainly uses U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to defeat Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It turns out that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes kept them for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that grazed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often tended by goat herders who were often children or adolescents, similar to the more well-known sheep herders.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted simply of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and to pull greater loads than on the slightly smoother roads of the time.
Crossties were introduced quite early to hold tracks in place, but gradually it became clear that tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden carton wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron lines were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means standing man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in a habitual way.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many cases.However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the source of the problems, and we should disable it.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made worse by mankind's overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
During the night, between 150 and 200 of these broadsides, now known as Dunlap broadsides, were produced.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Most paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people do not view them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have shelled legs and pointed claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their hind legs like T. Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer language.
Symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient familiarity with the flea, which are insects very suitable as parasites of humans.
Both the Assassin-bugs and the Bed-bugs are nest-dwellers, adapted to live in the nest or in the place of their host.
Around the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of their offspring, to raise a child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main objective of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method.This method in fact guides much of scientific research.
However, experimentation is not alone, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to make observations is also a guide for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of free cycling even without external indications.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments by marking either the DNA in the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts interested people who visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-the-spot activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the country's smaller towns by car to go to work and pass other people whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone, in some way, is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has moved the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of complaint about water quality or falling bridges are rare.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual vehicles and vehicles between two locations and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably consistent manner; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly.Their ability to fly helped them avoid predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back into place along their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot retract their wings are the mazzarella and the mayflies.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System went around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems sensible, because the Earth does not feel moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, at some points six miles wide.
In all, the Amazon provides 20 percent of all the water that the planet's rivers discharge into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, drawing water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remained the greatest in size and the best in technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were marveling at the monuments of their predecessors that were, at that time, well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated country.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by many of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since antiquity, as they can all be discovered in nature in indigenous form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, came up with the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy that contains small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of very small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them sit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the lapis was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Unfortunately, as more modern writing methods emerged, the lapes were relegated to a lower status and less use.
People now type messages on computer screens, and they never have to go to the computer.
Who knows what the keyboard will become when something new is invented.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bind a nucleus to many protons and neutrons.
In a similar way to pushing a heavy carton onto a ladder, splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split with little effort.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust.
The shell is about 70 km wide at its closest point and 100 km wide at its furthest point.
It is thin under the maria and thick under the highlands.
There may be more moon rocks on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centred on finding out what makes people happy or attractive.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories analyze what makes certain people want the things they want and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of attitudes can arise when managers start to manage their former colleagues.One end of the spectrum is to try to remain one of them.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to take disciplinary action, to carry out evaluations, to assign responsibilities, and to hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unknown individual who feels he has to change everything the team has done and marks it as his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behaviour often creates divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet in different time zones and this may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organisation's process of working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuous Sequencing approach as a method that is being used to help organisations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical proof of the theoretical approach to the investigation of conception.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our brains.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a strong fantasy connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, and deals with intelligent behavior, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as have several home computer software applications and videogames.
Field trips are a big part of every class.Often, teachers like to take their pupils to places where there is no possibility of going by bus.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips.Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, every year the website is replaced, but the older versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help to improve students' writing.Although students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually leads to this situation being changed.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer starts working on improving the writing so that it doesn't get criticized.
Also blogging "makes students learn more about the world around them". The need to satisfy the interest of the audience inspires students to be more engaging and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings and explain their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's multilingual capital and has a range of art galleries and museums that show Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north are the unspoiled natural beauty of Muscova and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as the perfect example of what it means to be considered Canadian by foreigners.
Larger areas further north have a rather sparse population and some are areas in a natural state almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest one, and a continent for it when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and this spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is surrounded by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling say that she is married, whatever her current marital status.
It is helpful to wear a ring too (but not one that seems to cost a lot of money.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may regard as harassment and it is not uncommon to be followed, pulled out of the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to insist on your preference (whether there are cultural differences or not, it does not mean that you have to accept everything as good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but then abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan king rebuilt the city as Daru-l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of geegaws, but all are tourist.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that covered most of the city's streets, particularly the city centre.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to know the state of the fighting that still persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for encounters with the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the boda boda (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The (local) normal price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short tour.
Along with its relative lack of accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city that is not well-known, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special series Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African elements.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the Northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the East, Zimbabwe to the North, and the Southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each containing different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the prototype of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, daily fees are applied for conservation and park entry.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides income for either selections of parks in South Africa or for all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The building's skyline that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a brightly lit bar due to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the North Shore.
This is the place where the British colonists took over so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves in the 'cold lands' they include some of the last remaining positions of the imposing jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (along the river) during the day, although most of them, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
As the intercity buses are often full, it is recommended that the ticket be purchased a few days in advance.
Many districts have small, comfortable and reliable Japanese Coaster Buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters (279 feet) high, 378 meters (1,850 feet) long, and have two arches 3.50 m (11.8 feet) wide.
The vertical gap under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region contained other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, harvesting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' encounter with the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP) whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands located in Stanley next to the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere in the islands and in Stanley credit cards and American dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although it is possible that British and US currency will be accepted; I spoke to the owners in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to change the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals still roam wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are killed because they do not keep their distance.These animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they have their space.
However, you should be aware that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the mid-19th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval conflict of 1889 where seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the town resulted in the killing of the main Tupua chief Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many sandy beaches, because Auckland lies between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
They are almost all covered with sand with a safe swimming pool, and most have the shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located within the Port of Waitemata, in the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sandy beaches for the family that are sometimes crowded and have a good spread of shops along the beach.
The main local beer is Number One, not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines probably travel better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but you can easily find bottled water if you have any concerns.
For Australians, the idea of coffee being called flat white is unfamiliar. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is stuffed with lots of cream (not foam), and tea is a milkless servut.
The hot chocolate is Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the stake are made all year round, and injuries due to any of these stake causes are rare.
Still, you should take advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety messages.
The box jellyfish is found along the coast and in the estuaries of rivers from October to April in the north of 1770.
Although sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
The saltwater crocodile does not live actively in the ocean, its primary habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, the traveller has the peace of mind that he will have somewhere to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often make arrangements with specific hotels, although you may find it possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages including breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need more time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any amendment or request for a penalty shall be passed on to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival goers decide to camp on-site, and many of them consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close you have to arrive early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, be sure to check the cabin location, as the sound of ice breaking is particularly harrowing for those most affected.
The cruises in Saint Petersburg include time in the city.The cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximise the time and money spent by guests.There are usually no windows and clocks and it can be difficult to find the exit points.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them on site.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness clouds judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will be driving in high latitudes or crossing mountain passages should consider the possibility of snow, snow, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with snow and snow, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on wet asphalt.
During heavy snowstorms, enough snow may fall in a short time to save you.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or dripping snow or by condensation or snow on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues to flow largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the focal point of many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to traveling on land for the observation of wild and wonderful African animals, particularly in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move toward cars and near standard equipment that allows good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes seen in the wild and are best seen with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walking", "hiking safari", or "footing") consists of a hike, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be organized within other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies have not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, and typical tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Walking on wet clothes can help them dry.Many hotels have a walk-in closet and a board to walk on available to use, even if you don't have one in your room.
If a walking stick is not available, or if you do not want to wear socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Care should be taken to avoid the fabric becoming overheated (which could cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some of them more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, if the water is raised for one minute it is enough, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in sealed bottles from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter rare animals that are unfamiliar to them in the regions where they stay.
Pests can poison food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, give poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill people, do not generally qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers going to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it passes often through isolated backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns predominate.
The maximum speed limits are notably lower than in the preceding and subsequent sections  commonly 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
However, curiously, mobile service is much stronger here than in many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastas are quite good, and in Bavaria, they are rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastas are common, and cooked apples are used in pastas all year round, and the cherries and apples start in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain nuts, jelly, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
The curry is a dish based on spices, in addition to meat or vegetables.
The carrier may be 'wet' or 'wet' depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Given that there are 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers the great variety of regional cuisine found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualifiers, the term tends to denote food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available in the archipelago, includes a range of simple spiced dishes, and the predominant flavours favourite of the Javanese are carrots, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese Indian coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staffs are footrests that extend on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may have safety issues due to the potential for the rider's legs to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a leg caught in the stirrup, he may be injured if the horse runs away.To reduce this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, many of the riders wear riding boots with smooth, rather drab, shoes and bristles.
Consequently, some editions, in particular British editions, have safety rods which allow the barrel skin strip to be detached from the body if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley (Wied Cochamó) - The main destination for Chilean climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with several large walls of granite and rock.
The highest points include spectacular views from the top.Fans from all parts of the world are constantly setting new routes among the endless potential of its walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport involving skating on snow-covered ground on skis or snowboards attached to one's feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many amateurs, sometimes known as 'ski bums', planning entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings showing skiers go back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport goes back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational skiing club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not generally involve, touring skiing or alpine-style mountain climbing, where the latter is done on steep ground and requires much harder skis and boots.
Consider the skiing route as a similar fishing route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if you were walking, but it is only very rarely that you will have the cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but contains many independent countries.Normally, to travel between countries you have to go through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you remain in this area, you will generally be able to cross the border without having to go through the passport control points again.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items that are more than 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are more recent than similar goods produced in bulk.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood among the Sámi and the culture around trade is also important for many people who have other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and had reindeer mainly as heavy-lifting animals.
Today many Sámi work in modern crafts.Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although used extensively, especially among non-Romani people, the word 'Gypsies' is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are to visit becomes subject to a travel advisory, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also consider consulting the advice of other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
An advisory report is a succinct summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often too quick, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather, which can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires in uncultivated areas are types and effects of severe weather, such as thunderstorms, windstorms, sea-storms, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include severe snowstorms, avalanches, blizzards, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any severe weather risks that may affect their area as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone organising a visit to a country which may be considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching the Internet for a Hostile environment course will probably give you the address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course is usually 2-5 days and involves role play, much first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but there are not too many publications on war zones.
Travellers planning sex reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undeclared gender (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies equally widely.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to go through scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow returning from waves that break off from the bay, often in a ripple or similar form.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and can form a fast current for the deep water there.
Many deaths are due to fatigue after attempting to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once out of the current, it is no more difficult than usual to swim back.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again or, depending on your skills and if you have been spotted, you may prefer to wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock comes before culture shock (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who find it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of your customs of your home culture.
When I arrived, people at first probably took patience and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also required for returning travelers.
The sound and light display of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the shadows before the show starts.
The sound and light history is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the colonization of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception where the sunken caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region in the south of the Peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here join the plain, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern or central part of Sentinella has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its summit reaching 4892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without mobile phone coverage, satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones do not generally replace mobile phones, as you have to be out in clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that need to communicate voice and data remotely.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year before entering university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course during an interim year abroad can actually improve your chances of progressing to higher education back in your country.
Typically there will be a tuition fee to register in these educational programmes.
Finland is a very good sailing destination. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and the lakes you do not necessarily need to go.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the larger lagoons are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This also applies to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise rather unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Many of the distinguished cruises in the Baltic include an extended visit to St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of days, returning at night and sleeping on the ship.
If you only travel by land using onboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany in the booklets.As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not by the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they have never been on a plane before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
For some, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens in flight can help them overcome fear based on what they don't know or on things they have no control over.
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly.Often, time is of the essence in the case of commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies there was a problem.
If you send your goods by air, some routes may take days to clear the landing and customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and here's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to come up with a fat wad of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy zero for business (business class), and eleven times more for first class!
In general, it does not make sense to look for discounts for business class and first class seats on direct A to B flights.
Airlines know well that there is a certain important group of air travellers who are willing to pay the highest prices for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and in comfort, and charge for these things.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the unsuccessful political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and bustling commercial center, built around a huge beach and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled houses, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, one finds interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain graves.
You will not regret spending half an hour strolling around the intriguing village.
To the north, within easy reach, is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, which became known abroad after Lord Byron's laudatory description of its great beauty.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, in the North visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Cappella), site of the world-famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are, in essence, visiting a site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive today who have managed to survive for so long here, and many more who had their loved ones killed or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.About half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also used extensively in public transport and other facilities.
Regular Metro announcements are made in Catalan only, but unplanned disruption is announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, cold, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to camp in Paris is still to dress up, and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred).
The unfriendly attitudes of the Parisian quickly fade when basic courtesies are shown.
The Plitvice Lakes nature park is covered with many trees, mainly beech, spruce and spruce, and contains a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.
The area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the rooster, the lynx, the wildcat and the wild boar can be found there, along with many more common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear elbows and shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shelters for unprepared women, but if you bring your own, especially one with a shouted color, you will receive a smile from the abbot or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear knee-length skirts.
This can also be measured from the stock in the store but those items are not washed after each person has worn them and so you may not feel comfortable wearing these trousers.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in every dish.
A popular and simple dish, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and the condiments that are available such as cheese, tuna oil, etc.
All nouns, next to the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of the sentence.
This is an important method of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
This certainly facilitates reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation in Italian is relatively easy because many words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on which vowel follows them.
Otherwise, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means for, while carro means a car.
The Persian language has relatively easy and, for the most part, regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar-introducing book can help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, remaining as museums, or educational venues.
As light pollution was not the problem at its best, these are generally located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Many modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The display of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where the coconut blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court only.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a 'single' sample.
If you visit a formal organised garden, the collection of 'samples' will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to be and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you are in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to face both heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you're planning to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme to base a holiday around.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or cruising to interesting towns on the Danube or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes of popular long-distance walking and cycling paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christendom, and it is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of passing the Easter Vigil in an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
There are obviously Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening over the Easter weekend, and congregations often begin the celebrations at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands were brought here by cattle, sheep or float.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey and so the giant peafowl became the main grazing animal within the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you go to the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter you experience polar night, which means that the sun has not risen above the horizon.
This offers good opportunities to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be somewhat dark all the time.
As the areas have a low population, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners are accustomed.
Suits are standard work clothes, and colleagues call each other by their nicknames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being on the group's effort and not on the encouragement of individual achievements.
Workers often need to get their superiors' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without reservation.
