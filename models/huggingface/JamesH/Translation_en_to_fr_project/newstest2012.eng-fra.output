Parliament Does Not Support Tymoshenko Freedom amendment
Today, the Ukraine parliament dismissed, within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment, the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko, was sentenced.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for reducing economic offences sentences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia.
The verdict is not yet final, and the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial has also evoked suspicion of bias.
The proposal to remove Article 365 from the Code of Criminal Procedure, upon which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was supported by 147 members of the parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Libya’s Victory
The story of Libya's liberation, or rebellion, has its defeat.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert. Without him, the war is over.
It is time to define the winners.
As a rule, Islamists win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law, of which we have heard.
Libya will be crime free, as the death penalty for stealing is amputated hands.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential religious renegades will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran.
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for.
However, our lifestyle is not unique nor the best one and would not, most likely, be suitable for, for example, people of Libya.
In fact, it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from non-believers.
The only excuse is that NATO raids were not controlled by an American general, but Allah, whose greatness they celebrate with each strike.
When winners are searched for in Libya, West is not on the list.
We participated in a shooting, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a dictator, their political ally, without any guarantee of profit.
Given recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to avoid military occupation of Libya.
The locals thus do not have to worry about removal of the "crusaders."
With the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for next to nothing?
It is quite likely that they will not.
The followers of Sharia law will not stop that.
New Era of Crisis Commences
France and the rest of Europe are now in the spotlight.
A statistical storm spread over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries released their 3Q GDP data.
Within quarters, Czech Republic economy stagnated; Germany and France are growing.
The debit market is breaking record today.
investors are no longer looking only at Italy; they now focus on Spain, France, Austria and others.
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany, Czech Republic, and some other countries, released preliminary economic development estimates for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has grown by the expected 0.5%; and France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted their second quarter data, where Germany did better than expected (a 0.3% increase from the original 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (original information suggests stagnation).
In the Czech third quarter, the Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5%.
The Czech Statistical Office reported that the GDP steadily declined.
The results are worse than expected by analysts.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year Czech economy showed an interim increase of 1.5%, but it slowed between quarters.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, in the third quarter the German economy grew by 0.5%.
In July and September, the Eurozone and European Union economy grew by 0.2%, which is almost equal to analyst estimates.
The Greek economy showed an interim decrease of 5.2%.
The earnings on its 10-year bonds are 28.45%.
Both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits.
Even Austria, Netherlands, France, and Belgium are beginning to experience problems.
Although the region is getting worse, Czech 1 - year bonds remain under 4%.
voices are coming from Germany, suggesting that ECB be the last resort creditor.
Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate a 200 million windfall.
Football representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season!
The Czech Republic won with a huge Czech and beautiful goal of Petr Jiráček .
In the second half Czech football kept its luxury lead from the home return match and will again feature at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the progress of the match in a detailed report.
The first half was almost without excitement, and a good portion of luck in the other half.
Czech representation team, partially due to home team's failure in the close; the great Czech; and heroic Jiráček; won 1:0 in Montenegro, and celebrates moving on to the European Championship.
Czech team defence only allowed Montenegro to threaten in the second half.
Damnanovic and Vucinic became the match's most lucky couple after losing two great opportunities.
The wonderful Petr Čech is one of the reasons the Czech football team will not miss the next European Championship.
From the opening minutes, the game was very pugnacious.
The two teams found it difficult to join in the combination, and the game remained within the midfield line most of the time.
The home team was also why the home team was not pressured in the first half. Long kicks behind the defence were neatly blocked by Czech defence.
Iranian Students Are Prepared to Die for their Country's Nuclear Program
Then they created a live shield.
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear plant in Iran.
The gesture is to express support for their country's nuclear program against a possible Israel attack.
The students' prayers in front of the building followed by their death chants to both the USA and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students created a live chain around Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility.
This way, they express their willingness to protect their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Iran has not stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
Possible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel.
At Tuesday afternoon, students' prayers in front of the entrance to Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility followed by death chants to both the USA and Israel.
In case of an attack, aimed at the highest possible paralysis of Iran’s nuclear program, the target would be, according to Israel press, the facilities in both Isfahan and Natanz, where the uranium is being enriched.
Obese child's diet: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight, while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, and 5% are obese.
As recent research shows, obese children usually come from unhealthy families.
Again, we can see the importance of the environment and models around a human being for his or her health development.
Examples of such foods are usually sausages, which occur up to half more frequently in the families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the education event Obesity is No Accident.
Moreover, obese children do not practice sports. However, only 15% of current schoolchildren reported that their parents have time for sports activities at least once a week.
The research was performed among 900 children.
The research took place at the end of last year's school year, and it included almost 900 elementary school children from throughout Bohemia.
It was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event, supported by both the General Insurance Company and Unilever.
The project has been joined by over 12 thousand school children from 4th to 8th grades.
Healthy diet and sufficient sports activities are key determining factors causing a dramatic increase in children who are either overweight or obese.
Examples are only half of those who asked have five meals a day, in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner pattern, one of the basic preconditions of correct diet.
No lunch and sausage in the evening
Scientists warn that even relative details are important for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast time.
In Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has breakfast separately.
The most interesting discovery was that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast.
Breakfast is the core of proper daily diet.
A survey has revealed that fries are more common in families with obese children.
Most people - regardless of their weight - drink sweet soft drinks every day (70%).
Though over 40% of children do regularly play sports, the number drops to less than half - 15% - when they are given parents.
Create your own menu
The second part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own menu based on the offered selection and their taste and opinion.
"Diet preferences of Czech children between 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy diet."
Their favourite meals include large number of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
However, the final report of the survey concludes.
As the main dish for lunch, pasta won very closely over poultry.
However, children showed little interest in legumes, fish, and vegetable lunches.
Health attitude
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits if they are given correct information.
Participants from the control group showed a significant change in their food preferences after the end of the Obesity is No Accident educational lecture.
This was quite significant, for example, in case of sweet soft drinks, where children would start to prefer plain water.
In addition, for main course children ate poultry and fish more often, limiting sweet and dumplings.
A Stylist Must Be a Good Psychologist, Professionals Claim
In the opening article on stylist training, I was a bit angry about the amount of information in the introductory lessons.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three experts from the field; dressing tips for difficult figures; and a seminar on how it works in practice.
More is yet to come.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks are waiting.
The training is held every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really loaded with information.
This time, together with Alenka, the Director, (there is no single man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry.
Most women are not perfectly symmetrical.
One has short neck, one has a boyish figure without proper curves, and one is overweight.
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, make the neck look longer or add the curves needed.
The advice was to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist.
If the skirt or trousers do not fit, then at least one piece should be custom-made.
You will not regret the investment, as fitting clothing is a very expensive item.
In a custom-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting, rolling, sliding, etc.
Boyish figures can wear clothes with ruffling, applique, embroidery or shirring.
Given the abundance of such information and figure types, I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head.
Still I fear it is too much, with regard to the homework we received.
Each participant was given a celebrity to create two outfits for day and night.
We must consider their current appearance, their fashion style, and figure type.
I am to dress Miranda Kerr who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
Inside I am very happy, as she is so much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained about a ton (please understand I am exaggerating).
We must cut the clothing out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphically process them.
Moodboard, as it is called, then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction.
It is important to think about the graphic part of styling.
A stylist is not only dressing physical people, but also creating product pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as trendy handbags, jackets, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
Then it was not until Sunday.
A stylist needs general knowledge
Following Saturday’s lecture, filled with information on figure types, was a delightful event with three guests from the field.
Styling, Honza Pokorný; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer, Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and a stylist should be able to use this fact.
A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways.
In this case, variability is key.
The trench coat may be worn in the standard way, over jeans and T-shirt, as a coat; but it may also be worn on naked body, with step-ins, as a dress.
Another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar, and the whole look changes completely.
Play with it, he stressed.
However, I appreciated the following advice the most: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
'Then you can start breaking them,' Jakub told us.
Here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to mix with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something else.
Not mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that stylist must have more outfit versions than the number he is able to take pictures of.
Then, for a ten-page fashion story (equals ten outfits), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them.
Now I also know that in picture, a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality.
The following is a further consideration when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorný confirmed that image and style are half the success.
Madonna is no miraculous singer, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world-wide star.
The attitude to stylist services is still quite cold in Czech Republic.
Even famous people often consider it redundant (believing it is sufficient to be good at something, and how they look at it comes second).
If someone finally lets us create their styling, we should expect them to give us different (smaller) size than what they actually wear.
Then, we are left to Google and see if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining/losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, both Honza and Mario stressed that stylists are not enough to know fashion and be able to create an outfit.
Our work mainly consists of communicating with people we dress, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to pander, and stick to one's opinion.
If a manager asks you to go through her clothes and add some nice pieces, you cannot throw out her whole wardrobe telling her how ugly the clothes are.
"Find at least a few pieces you can praise, and recommend what to wear them with" Mario says.
Then he showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain.
The bag you secure around your waist to carry all the props you need.
Beyond the usual things such as scissors, sticky roller, or safety pins, it should have nylon thread (for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats), special clip-ons for holding the clothes in case it is too large (pins and similar things are forbidden), or a sewing set.
To have change from listening, and gain some practical experience, we learned how to properly underlay shoes.
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even, the soles may get damaged.
Because we kept away, we kept going.
You must not touch the shoes with scissors to prevent any damage.
This requires real skill.
Mario pleased me by congratulating my job.
The skills mentioned are not my cup of tea.
This is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session.
I am beginning to realize that being a professional stylist is no piece of cake, no matter what people say.
V Need for Speed: The Run takes place across America.
Review
The original carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely unnecessary and sloppy mistakes.
The ambitions were achieved at some point, but it does not matter since nobody wanted to do any extra work.
The new version titled The Run was a highly anticipated release.
The game promises to change the old Need For Speed series in a new direction, and the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre.
The main character gets out of the car and runs.
The series ends with many different things than we expected.
The game represents a possibly decent arcade race, but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes that have been featured in the series for a number of years.
This means they are not mistakes, but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts well.
You are introduced to a story, where the main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America.
The first person to get into the car is in San Francisco, and your task is to be the first one to reach New York.
The idea brings several interesting features.
The route is divided into ten stages, divided into over fifty races.
This means each race takes place on a different route, and given stages are set in different and interesting environments.
One therefore does not feel the game keeps offering the same things.
The graphics are very similar to previous parts of the series, but some of the environments are very nice to look at.
Still, it is not world-shattering.
driving through desert, autumnal countryside, or high in snow-covered mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the races are, occasionally, colored by an unusual feature.
Examples of desert areas are sandstorms, significantly reducing the visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains you must be careful not to get under an avalanche.
Individual races are ordered well.
There are only a few types, but it is sufficient.
Then you try to overtake a number of competitors (basic regular race); then you try to beat the time (standard stopwatch race); or you are in a duel with a single rival.
On top of everything else you sometimes get a few police officers who make your efforts more difficult.
The parts outside the car are new.
The animations are just interactive animations, where mostly Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
No difficult.
The surprise is that the parts are much less than you would expect (just three to be precise).
It actually works for the game, because this feature does not get boring; within what was already said, it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining.
The driving model follows the footsteps of previous parts.
This means that it is no more special, but it cannot be considered a negative.
If you are looking for a real-to-life simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
Still, this driving model is fully suitable for action style racing, even though we could find better at the competition.
So far everything is very good.
After some time problems appear.
In contrast with the driving model, the collision model is not that good.
The game is not expected to have complicated deformations and collisions, but when you have no idea before crashing into any object how your car will act, something is wrong.
When overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic you sometimes lightly touch the other car, but sometimes in nearly the same situation your car ends in wild pirouettes.
Or, completely crashed.
This is not such a big deal due to the restart system, but is enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track, the game takes you back to the last interrupted point.
The only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them up, you have to start the race from the start.
This makes it an aid in case something does not work, but you cannot rely on it completely.
sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a specific section of the race by heart.
The game’s main shortcoming is that the same things often happen in the same place.
Examples of some turns have to be driven through in a specific way, otherwise you will not fit in.
Other times you meet civilians at a given place in the same configuration, no matter if you come first, fifth, five seconds later or one minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you can see your rival drive through the two cars so easily, while when you get there the cars are already positioned so you can either drive around or slow down.
It does not matter when you get to them; everything is set up so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
The competitors have other advantages, too.
While playing the game you will find several places, where, regardless of time, the same competitor will replace you at the same spot.
The most noticeable sight is at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you are driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously your rival has to get ahead no matter what.
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you, he makes your vision worse, which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section.
One can understand the effort to make the game more interesting and adrenalin-filled, but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly.
It's a pity, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you cannot focus on what is going on around you.
It is not important if you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique tracks, ordering of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
The gas stations are often located along the way, as they are where your car may change despite the fact that most cases your current one is fully sufficient.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; strong American cars for straight highway sections; and exotic sports cars for technical driving such as along crooked mountain tracks.
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode, and these are the races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you gain both medals and experience points for your profile, common for both challenges and the story.
Various features are available for getting a higher driver level: starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds.
Again, the profile is linked to an on-line Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players, and ensures community functions.
The next setback is the situation from the last race in the story.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let's say you do), where you speed down the tracks in darkness (let's say you do).
The speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say it does), when suddenly a subway train rolls down from behind you, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
The editorial staff kept talking about whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons.
The technical part of the game is nothing special, but the visual impression is mostly pleasant, sometimes even great.
The recording, in some cases, sometimes tragically, decreases.
This is particularly important in large numbers of participants, where fluent recoding would not help you much.
The sound is all right; the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
The soundtrack is 'flecked in from all quarters' but there will be no many people buying the game because of its music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes, The Run is the best part of NFS for the past several years.
However, the game feels unfinished.
It is surely a good entertainment, but be prepared to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights.

EU Ambassadors Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation of being negative and Euro-sceptical.
"Lisbon Treaty caused significant imbalance between individual institutions."
"I did not expect it to be such a tough war."
'It will take five or six years to get a stable, calm situation, and all players get used to their new roles', EU Ambassador Milena Vicenová opened her lecture at the Law Department.
The first part of her lecture proved how true she is to her "Clearly and openly about Europe" motto in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU organs and the relationship between them in such a clear and intelligible way that many UK law teachers could be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenová praised the work of new long-term European Council President, Herman Van Rompuy:
Critics called him plain, a grey office mouse who cannot fulfil any role. I have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquired his role.
"He is a person who can listen to all twenty seven member states, communicate with them perfectly, and has a clear vision of where the EU should head.
The new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative was a response to a question: Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?
No One Wants To Ban Our Cheese Specialties
Vicenová further focuses on the key EU agenda in past, present and near future.
She described Czech presidency from last year as a success.
Czechs were fighting the coming financial crisis; they resolved the as crisis; and organized the East Partnership Summit.
The fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to Czech Republic.
Currently Czech representatives in EU have been very busy.
As the ambassadors said, both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused continued stirring.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget is needed, which is very complicated due to the current crisis.
The budget will be a little and frugal, which fields will be prioritised; which countries will be supported more and which less.
The ambassadress reminded the key slogans she took to Brussels: "About Europe, Clearly."
"I really do not like all the abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon no one understands.
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers, different size bananas or that someone wants to ban our cheese?
She also wants to use EU environment better, and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multispeed Europe Is Coming
The ambassadress says Czechs are believed to be Eurosceptics, as well as people seeing the negative rather than the positive side of things.
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions.
The candidate’s modesty and inability to write motivation letters, together with low support from Czech side.
The success of Czech presidency highlights the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
'I believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak is coming to join us, the Frenchman next to me says: "Hey, what is that gathering about, is that the Visegrad Group again?' and he is not happy about it in any way.
In the future, Vicenová expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of Member States.
The concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe is very realistic.
We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone.
"We have Schengen area, and we have a reactive cooperation institutes."
The first time it was defined that countries who want to cooperate are to cooperate, while those who are not willing can stand off.
The number of such institutes will grow, and it will be a highly two-speed Europe, according to Vicenová.
In this regard, she appreciated the role of both Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which all topics affecting the EU should be negotiated by all Member States, and not only those in the Eurozone.
Brand Story:
The IMB Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
Should someone search for a word that best describes the IMB strategy, the most close one would be "long-term."
The wide public, IMB is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is seen as a highly temporary one, but it was founded over 100 years ago.
The company’s stability is linked to its first boss, a visionary, Thomas J. Watson Sr.
The philosophy of his life was that many world problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
The motto: 'Think!' becomes an iprint around which the future giant would unfold (as well as the name of its internal magazine that IMB started to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the company culture Watson was building carefully.
IMB long term thinking means continuing movement towards the future.
IMB survived and flourished for a hundred years, because it remained true to its original values, and it was not afraid to change everything around it.
During our first century, this allowed us to transform technology, business, and the company.
In the second century we hope to achieve even more, says current company Director Samuel J. Palmisano.
Sophisticated System
In 1930s, Watson approached employee care similarly to Baťa in Czech Republic - people from IMB were among the first American employees to have paid holiday, insurance from their employer, elegant uniform, and a complex system of rewards for the best inventors and businessmen.
As sophisticated is IBM's long-term relationship with customers.
From the very start, the company was brilliant in finding talented people. It was one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which provided it with great selection.
Following the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan for a woman, Virginia Rometty, to take over after Palmisano next year.
She has been working in IMB for 30 years, and is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IMB has been organising jams, on-line brainstorm sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people.
Good Reputation Institution
The Company's strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image.
The beginning of IBM was a institution, but the concept of the company was that of a institution rather than a technology company,' a Harvard Business School Professor and author of the book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, told the Economist.
IBM is not a technology firm, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology.
As the company says, there is a difference between entering a market and creating it.
During the past 100 years, IMB, or the "Big Blue" as it is called in the US, has grown into one of the world's most important companies.
It seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies.
It has the most patents of all American technology companies; five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
It is known to include cash point, pay card, financial swap, and floppy disc.
With about 220 billion dollars, based on market capitalisation, IBM has become the second largest technology company (Apple being number one) this year, overrunning Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
View ahead
However, not all its products satisfied both customers and period.
If your business is defined by movement forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to past.
It is why IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms - if they do not work, it leaves them.
This is how it differs from, for example, Microsoft’s competitors, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective Technology
IBM's revenues mainly consist of services, about one fifth of which is from software and hardware.
In 1990, with over half share, it was the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars. While the same time, it has invested 58 billion dollars into perspective technologies.
It has continued the investments even after 2008, when the modern economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM follows the legacy of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the amount of investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IMB seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm.
Since the start of 2008, the price of IBM's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent; and the company's net income has been continuously growing.
IBM's company motto is to change everything, except its values.
The flexible giant may therefore expect that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will manage.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Travel
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York, a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation" was quite complicated.
It took the name of IBM in 1924, originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundations for later IBM were laid by a merger of four companies, the history of which goes back to the 1880s.
Their technology was such as the legendary time clock, which is a clock recording the time when employees arrive and leave work.
The architect of the new company was a businessman, Charles Ranlett Flint, who, until 1930, also presided over the Board of Trustees.
Flint hired a Director of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with company management.
The leader then took the IBM founder in the shade - Watson's ideas remain the core of the corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the revenue doubled to nine million dollars, and company's vast expansion into all continents started.
Watson became so important for the company that after nearly forty years his position in the Director's Chair was taken by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language.
In 1960s, both people and computers from IBM helped NASA control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, man's flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defines the computer standards of the period, called IBM 5150, came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company, Lenovo, while acquiring the consultant division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and thus started its full focus on consulting and high value services.
In the past three years, IBM has been highly successful with its Smarter Planet concept.
It is aimed at both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that are not yet planned for and improving traffic or town management.
For commerce, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle.
IBM’s history is strong even in our country.
In former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe are in Prague, where there is also a world level research team focusing on voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her Unfaithful Wife:
Iveto, keep the fool, I do not want him anymore!
Darina Rtářová (53) says it is over!
After her husband, Josef Rychtář (53) became both the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still believed he would wake up and come home.
However, she does not want to wait any longer, and set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa may return home but no longer as my partner," Rychtářová explains.
The summer of 2009, when Darina Rychtářová provided shelter for Bartošová in her house, she probably had no idea of what was going to happen to her marriage.
If Iveta moved out of Říčany 30 days later, Pepa would not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted he loves her.
After Darina resigned, she tried to accept her husband's affair, and now she gave him her last goodbye.
Rychytář is not interested in whom his wife sleeps with.
If Rychář and Bartošová would split, his wife will not welcome him with open arms.
When he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will chase him out.
However, he will complete his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a person I have certain bonds to.
So far Josef is not angry that his wife closed the hind gate on him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta, and I do not mean to change that."
"My wife decided for marriage on paper, and I respect it."
"Our company still operates; I am in charge of repairs, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate in a completely normal way, only we do not share our bed anymore," Rychtář told Blesk.
The actress claims that if Rychtářová found a new love, he would not stand in her way.
We do not sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, with whom and if she has a boyfriend.
I know it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and I accept full responsibility.
The Worst Feminine Habits: Do They Concern You?
If you ask men to name some common women’s bad habits, they usually come up with all of them in an instant.
Ladies, do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow, describing several women's habits that make men see red?
Shopping
Does your boyfriend complain you are addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Do you like shopping, mass sales?
If you do, your shopping may be considered as a bad habit.
Some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping.
However, who of you would resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all (ideally, in various colour versions) in the changing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it may become absolute hell.
Remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start doing some exercise?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you find these verbs familiar?
Do you?
Then you belong to the group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
No, you should stop looking after yourself, but many men are literary allergic to their partners' constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints, the more annoying women are.
Order and Cleanliness First
It is like a never ending story.
Cleaning the windows, vacuuming, wiping the floors, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on clean floors in dirty shoes; your children for making dirty glasses and leaving fingerprints over the glass pane in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", remember that no extremes are good; and that in your family order and cleanliness should not go first.
This harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationship, as well the whole family.
Bossing About
"Throw the underwear into the bin."
"Do you plan to wear the dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dishtowels do not belong on the floor."
If you boss your partner around several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Naturally you mean well, you just want everything to be perfect.
If men realized that, women would not have to work around so much...
Gossiping
Some women like gossiping, offending, and plotting against others.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to discuss who, where, who with, how, and why.
Every now and then, probably each of us release a gossip here or there.
It is probably the nature of women.
However, there are tougher gossips, women who often gossip and despise everyone. They are, especially in female work team, very dangerous for their surroundings.
Jágr and Voráček assisted Philadelphia in the victory
Through Monday's NHL match, hockey forward Jaromír Jágr's two assists helped Philadelphia to a 5:3 victory on Carolina's ice. Again, he leads the Czech team in the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of a thirty nine year old star; he added an extra pass and was voted best player of the match.
Two assists in the match also came from Jágr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the match, Jágr told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the match he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt."
sometimes you feel such things, explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first Flyers shot.
The second score for the team was Czech.
The Hurricanes' Voráček took the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
The first part of the second part saw a home player, Patrick Dwyer, narrow the lead in a power-play, but the second part started with Flyers again.
Specifically by Giroux.
After assist with Jágr, he scored the second goal, and his shot was turned into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
'I don't want to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely among the best three', added Jágr.
"I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to assist him."
All those years in NHL, my teammates have tried to assist me, and now it is reversing.
Charleston added a dramatic goal with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's goal from a penalty shot, making it a single goal difference.
More complications were prevented by Matt Read who increased the difference to two points.
Prongs did great in our zone.
"He poked out the puck, I gained speed, and Read went on to the more distant pole.
"I aimed at him, and I am glad it worked," Voráček told the following day.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Canadian Montreal defenseman, Jaroslav Špaček, left the match in the second period with an upper body injury.
The combination of the experienced back, the hosts lost their two-goal lead and lost 2:3 after a penalty shootout.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to score on one of their raids.
More than lost points, the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young men."
However, there is no way we can do about that, we just have to face it.
"Substitution by substitution, it was overwhelming and we could not resist."
"We should have made the game simpler, moving the puck out of our zone."
The weakness of the defense, P. K. Subban, added.
With three interventions, Czech goalie Ondřej Pavelec helped Winnipeg to a 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
Jets" goals, which interrupted a five-match series of losses, were shared by five different players.
Development of Trip Prices since 1989
In 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea, and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was restricted, travel agencies mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries.
The Czech tourists took the sea to Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea near the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both to the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. However, the Yugoslavian regime changed West, which caused significant limitations to Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovaks too) were not allowed individual travel within the socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel as individual to, for example, the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from the country was required; otherwise, individual travel was unable.
The time, travel agencies offered some West trips, but one either had to stand in line overnight, with a sleeping bag or have some good friends in the agency.
Still, that was not all.
The foreign currency assurance was essential for travel to the West, but it was not granted to unreliable people, who were not allowed to travel at all.
Czech Republic currency was not freely converted; without the currency assurance, it was unable to obtain financial means (Western currency) for travelling West.
Most Czechs spent their holiday home, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that remains today.
Since 1989 Czech tourism has experienced a real revolution.
While in 1989, a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the climax of our travels, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world.
The great paradox we do not realize is that until 1989, we could not freely visit the currently most popular Croatia, as it was part of former Yugoslavia.
The first few years after the 1990s, visas for neighbouring West European countries were cancelled. This started a large wave of short-term visits to Vienna and Germany.
Everyone wanted to travel to the West for a moment.
In Paris Czech tours slept in parks in tents, because they had no money to pay for a hotel or pension.
The Czech tourism typical feature was bringing their own food (cans, salami, etc.) to save money.
The second important event was the introductory of freely converted Czech Crown. After years, tourists finally could freely buy Western currencies.
Our living standards and average income were growing, which, around 1997, resulted in another important moment.
Since 1997, increasing demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights by charter airlines.
After 1990s Czechs no longer needed visas for visiting nearly all developed world countries, except for USA. This made travel even easier.
Next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling occurred in 2000. High demand resulted in the first direct charter flight from Czech Republic to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, Czech tourists will travel to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
The next important event in this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On November 17, USA removed visas for Czech tourists. Our country has thus become permanently a member of the world's most developed countries.
First time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (51.3%) and for the first time in history they spent over 15 thousand Crowns per person per holiday abroad, including their costs at the destination.
General Meeting Should Find a President, Mate Threat Returns
The threat to a successor to Ivan Hašek, the head of Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR) is growing, with a risk that his successor will not be known until the next ordinarial general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on which election rules to follow.
Without it, polling for the three candidates will not start.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are eager to lead Czech football.
Hašek resigned from his position in June, calling on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
Hašek's era sees football back in disputes between both association chambers, unable to agree on a common candidate.
This was fully shown on September 16, when a new President was to be elected.
General meeting delegates took a short trip to the National House in Prague, Smíchov, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only regarding the election method.
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only, or also officials given attorneys' power.
This single point has been partially resolved since, thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on attorney power is not possible.
However, arguments about the election rules continue, though.
The Executive Board has not been of much help either, though at its regular and extraordinary meetings it mostly takes a look at this issue.
The view of election options has changed several times, but the key point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in 3rd round to avoid mate?
The argument is based on either following the by-laws or to find another model.
The winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for.
Moravia is reported to accept a compromise to have the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election.
Czech part requires that in the total percentage, the winner must have at least two-third superiority.
However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning, which would completely deny the two-chamber concept.
The interesting fact is that the by-laws define the election rules for Pelta is estimated to be the best of the candidates.
'I wish the elections follow the by-laws to the maximum.'
Plzeň owner Pavel Pelta is a first time candidate, and in his statements he mainly supported Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
The new President will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that in future, candidates will cooperate constructively.
All passionate stirring will calm with today's announcement of the national team into the European Championship.
The most experienced candidate is a Jablonec functionary.
Rajchch is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambivalent."
It is not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to purposeful adjustment of regulations.
The blockage of the general meeting may cause another blockage of the general meeting.
"I hope common sense wins," Rajchl said.
There is no time left for an agreement between the parties.
Some negotiations are reported to have occurred directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the generality will be complete before the match.
The extra flight that was to take the Vice Presidents Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorica was cancelled due to technical failure.
Finally, a meeting at ministry level, which is expected to happen on Wednesday, may decide.
Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobeš, wants to force the split parties inside the most important sports association in the country to agree.
The game is a lot of work: Government grants; football trustworthiness; and the planned general meeting of Czech sports following Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík Enters the Presidential Fight As He Doesn’t See a Suitable Candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the Head of Pilsen football players, Tomáš Paclík saw a strong candidate, who would meet all his expectations of a new Czech Football Association (FAČR) President, he would not even apply for the top position.
If there is a good quality candidate, I'd fight for him and not participate in the fight.
However, no such person is currently found, Paclík told ČTK.
Paclík's motivation to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta from entering the FAČR.
However, Paclík stressed that if he does win, he will only remain the President until 2013, when a regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager, not overly connected to football life.
"I have spoken to some people that could be considered."
Then I was very sick to hear some people say that at this point they do not even want to identify themselves with Czech football.
"I want to change this opinion," he said.
The most strong disagreement with Pelta is based on the relationship of Pelta to Roman Berbr, President of Pilsen Regional Football Association.
Paclík therefore does not accept Pelta as President.
If he wins, current situation will be kept and no football would move forward.
Together with support from Berbr, a capable businessman, this would be even more harmful for the football," Paclík said.
The evidence is based on the fact that some years ago, Pelta's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption investigation and she was out without a sentence.
'I do not know what prestige Pelta's victory would bring to football.'
Why would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA?
Paclík wins on Thursday, he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
'He is very capable.'
"I can see him as the head of the representation."
'But he cannot manage the association.'
'I do not poke my nose in what I do not understand,' said Paclík, who gained much attention in September when he supported the removal of the board of referees led by Luděk Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims he would dare to manage the association.
The latter is based on his skills from private companies, and since last summer he has been managing the Pilsen team that, with his support, took the first league victory in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its improvement."
However, he does not hide his antipathy to some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, leading to disgusting situations.
One of his priorities would be strengthening relations between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax.
The key things the new President should attend to is that the new President should attend to.
Taxes on gambling are imposed as the political parties declare, I understand their argument but clearly state where the money will go.
Paclík does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden, but he believes that an FAČR President should be a non-party one.
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, and Rajchl to Prague Dukla.
It is not ideal.
However, I do not see any point in transferring my share in the Pilsen club hypocritically to someone else, while coming back to the club in six months.
Pelta Promised New FAČR Regulations That would Prevent Election Mates
The President’s Candidate, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he is elected, he would work to enforce new FAČR regulations to prevent future disputes over the election rules.
After the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk, a Jablonec functionary remains optimistic and believes that the pre-election fight would be substantially reduced by today's prospective success of our football representation.
Before the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if he would win, he would focus on both representation and financial resources.
The last general meeting was a last moment for him to participate in the elections.
People at all levels have been in football for long, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday.
They feel it is high time for someone to lead the association, says the man who spent many years in Jablonec and the association's Executive Board.
This gives him reason to believe he is able to manage Czech football.
The current problems with elections are caused by the euforia that was there in the time of Ivan Hašek's reign.
"Unfortunately, regulations that were not as perfect as we thought were passed at the general meeting in June.
However, if various representations were not accepted, we would have had a President since September.
The proposal was to rewrite the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates.
If I become President, I will take it as my personal task, and I am willing to take personal responsibility in case the attempt fails.
It is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without.
Other than that, he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals.
In past, he has already announced his cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognises for his legal education; he is well aware that his rival candidate should be his first Vice President.
The longest he has not attacked Tomáš Paclík, who has constantly criticised Pelta.
"He has been in football for over a year, and has some success."
However, his attacks were not decent, and many people were surprised by his election campaign.
However, this is also why some people now doubt his true character.
The most important weapon in football knowledge is knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to representation.
The representation should be the shopping window of football.
"I would also try to end all affairs, starting from the Bohemians case or after the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal."
Following that, I would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors to ensure enough money for the whole football, which is a candidate for the Czech Republic.
Then he promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not include any personal housecleaning.
'I need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees'. That was his message for Strahov, where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness.
The general meeting is planned for Thursday, and he believes that on Thursday the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain.
If only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over.
'Football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader' says Pelta, who, two days before the crucial day of his career as a functionary, remains optimistic.
Rajchl Promises That Under him, the FAČR Will Start Working Hard.
If, on Thursday, Jindrich Rajchl, the existing Vice President, is to become the President of Czech Football Association, many people in the Association would not be pleased.
Rajchl promise that if he is elected, hard work will follow.
The executive board wants to establish system change and make members of the Executive Board responsible for individual football areas.
The President also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; bring more money to football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to representation, professional football, and performance football for the young.
However, I do not mean I would do everything on my own, Rajchl said in his interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to distribute the competencies within the Executive Board so that each member focuses on a specific area."
'I'll distribute tasks strictly so that in each segment football makes big progress.
However, that probably would not please many people, as it would require hard work, not just criticizing of others' work.
Critical atmosphere in football movement might have made him doubt his candidacy.
"I am known to work 20 hours a day."
However, I need to know if it has any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and questioning my every move.
"However, many people told me I must not give up, otherwise others would follow."
The trust is a trust I cannot just throw away.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hašek.
"A great amount of work was done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it all away."
processes have been started that may produce fruit in a few years, and I do not want someone else to stop them.
"I believe in systematic approach, which is something I do not think Mirek Pelta is competent to do."
The most important thing is that he is mainly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones.
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not for being subjective."
"I try to be objective."
Because I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone has a good time, not just the chosen few.
Additionally, he refutes the claims he would only be a Czech President.
Though some people try to claim that I plan to do the most for Moravia.
Examples are Czech and Moravian parts, winners of which would continue into the first league.
However, this would prevent the current situation, where only three Moravian units are in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia.
As the Presidential fight is joined by Pilsen Club Manager Tomáš Paclík, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win.
However, I can still feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber that elected me as its Vice President, and can see some clear successes in his career.
The other hand, he considers the fact that the association does not stick together as his own fault.
While claiming that Pelta has been disqualified from returning trustworthiness to Czech football, he considers Paclík a strong candidate.
No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year.
If he is elected, I hope he will continue in the things Ivan Hašek started, without major personnel change in the committees.
'He would not want to twist things for his own benefit,' Rajchl said.
Europe’s most beautiful pools
Water falls
By Julia Stanek
Fishing pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest.
One book can tell you where the water is at its best.
The only thing Iris Meder could not do without on research trips over the past one and half years was her swim suit.
The water is moving towards artistic designed domes, has swam towards marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool and has marvelled at carefully restored art nouveau pools.
Then she rushed to add any pool she likes to her notebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder has looked at more than 200 pools - covering everything from public pools in Munich to historical bathing palaces in Black Forest and "hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
The journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe took her through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old is a real bathing culture enthusiast.
The water is a different matter, says Meder.
The only downside is that swimming fans have to deal with blue glazed tiles and chlorine while joggers can breathe in the scent of shrub forests or hear the bright twitting of birds in the park.
One day I asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ugly.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface double architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and etherical sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are stimulated, according to Meder.
The water surface is the surface of the water in pools, and you have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor.
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All is mirrored visually: high ceilings, colourful tiles and diving board.
The illustrated pocketbook The Joys of Bathing provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of historic pleasure and health oases over 190 pages - and makes you want to swim.
Collector Meder discovered some notable examples during his research in Hungary.
The researcher found nitrates in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Miskolctapolca) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and thermal baths with alkaline water in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
The most famous outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. You can see all of Zurich from a rooftop bath or look out on the snow-capped Arlberg from a steam bath in St. Anton.
The most unusual pool design is waiting for bathers in Längenfeld.
It steams during winter from three open topped shells dwarfed by the Ötztal mountains behind it.
Alhambra in Black Forest
Pool collector Meder was not greeted by the smell of chlorine in every pool.
The Árpád baths in Békesssaba, Hungary, smell so strongly of oil you may believe you are in a health spa.
The smell is from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water. The water is almost black with silt that sticks to your skin as you slide into the pool - a special wellness experience.
Iris Meder was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places. When she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Luhatschowitz, she found the area sealed off.
The baths, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, have been closed.
Then, when she looked through the weather-blocked windows of the red, white and yellow art nouveau building, she could see weeds growing through the tiles.
One place where decay has been stopped is a magical bath in the Black Forest - the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The baths have already gone through three stages of construction. You will not only see neo-Romanesque elements from the period after it was built in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style added around 1900.
Following careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favourite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not only because she is from the Black Forest.
'It is a real achievement to harmonize such different architectural styles so brilliantly' says Meder.
The thermal pool in such a palace is clearly of secondary importance.
Agricultural commodities speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodity trading investigated
By Christian Teev
Should Deutsche Bank stop trading agriculture commodities?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for poor people around the world.
The CEO plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - -
The situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans do not accept that banks speculate on agriculture commodities such as wheat and maize.
The majority of the questioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agriculture, as trading deepens the problems faced by the poorest people in the world.
The findings were made in a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid October.
The author of the report, Harald Schumann, shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives prices - and banks are thus complicit in global hunger.
The campaign by consumer advocates is aimed at the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, but large banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also trade in the same way.
Initially, commodity betting was designed to protect traders against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the supply and demand rules and are taking a huge profit at the cost of the poorest.
In contrast to US competitors, Ackermann has responded to the criticism, promise to investigate the claims and has given no trade to risk the good reputation of Deutsche Bank.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Bank's Management Board with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Commodity trading may be reduced or stopped completely.
Ackerman working on his image
The Foodwatch president, Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, while emphasizing his criticism of the financial sector.
As top bank lobbyist, Ackermann has a particular role, according to Bode.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments that bet money on food prices," Bode said.
It is not matter if this is about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.
Ackermann's sensitive response is at first surprising, but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image a few months before his term in office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman will not move to the Management Board as planned.
Cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image.
The latter needs little concern for costs - it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome.
One in two people would withdraw commodity investment.
Foodwatch is fighting to keep the manager under pressure.
To date, more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation's campaign.
The survey was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November and 1001 people participated.
No more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that rely on food prices.
Banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent would consider closing their account and switching to a different bank.
21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and was abandoned.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition centre.
Austria's pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, is a famous textbook example of modern post-war architecture with its clear shapes, glass halls, bold strokes and new construction materials.
Schwanzer's pavilion won the Grand Prix d'Architecture in 1958 for its light floating steel-glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world fair.
Then he finally took international fame with his legendary four-cylinder BMW Tower and its bowl-shaped sister building.
The pavilion, which was designed as a temporary exhibition building, was relocated to the Schweizer Garten near Vienna's Südbahnhof, converted and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the 20er Haus.
However, the building was not suitable for museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home.
The building remained empty from 2001 and went into a worse and worse state of repair.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now renovated the pavilion, which has been named the 21er Haus and will be used as a contemporary art museum.
The museum is a branch of the Belvedere museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening - a delight in every respect.
Agnes Huslein-Arco who became the new Director of Austrian Galerie Belvedere in 2007 was instrumental in the new start.
Arco, an art history graduate with a remarkable career in ice skating, went on to Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and to become the founding director of the Museum of Moderne in Salzburg, convinced politicians and conservators to continue with the renovation, attracting public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building.
The new museum was to house the permanent collection of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, a café and bookshop, alongside contemporary art.
Strict supervision & limited budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project.
The most important thing for him was to renovate and expand Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna, and won the competition.
The original design was known and knew the issues the building was facing.
The latest changes have been much more serious. The building was "a energy guzzler," says Krischanitz.
The window profile of the glass facade was replaced, fibreglass-reinforced safety glass was placed in and the glass roof was replaced with high-grade safety glass.
Thermal bridge steel girders were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for new use of the building, a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting, and a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building but still the delicate Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red-brown colour of rust-proofing.
The cinema hall is exactly as it used to be.
All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget.
They often wanted to find material that was good, cheap and meets the approval of the monument authority.
The building has remained flexible and light despite the restrictions, problems and changes.
Krischanitz recently stated that the pavilion was tough - a typical "drop in the city story".
Architects like this are always in the wrong place, but nonetheless want to "stimulate real awareness."
The 21er Haus is very much in the right place, as there has been a stroke of luck in town planning.
The 21er Haus may also be a second stroke of luck, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has acquired the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package into the million
Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in winter.
The number of employees is to double.
The costs will reach millions.
According to a news report, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million Euros more this year in the fight against winter-time cancellations and delays.
According to an internal crisis plan at Deutsche Bahn, the Bild newspaper has reported that around 300 million Euros are planned for the coming year.
Investment is aimed at improving the availability of locomotives and the rail network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 16,000.
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by start of business and 90% of the critical points within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business, as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also some delay in delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to check the axles of ICE trains for many years after an ICE train's axle broke in Cologne's main station.
Deutsche Bank pays multi-million pound fine in USA
Another crisis is following after the uproar around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a multi-million dollar fine in USA.
While home problems have not been enough for Deutsche Bank, its past in the USA is now catching up with it.
The issue centres on the sale of mortgage securities.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses several major banks of misleading credit unions into buying financial products.
The value of securities fell dramatically during the financial crisis and weakened the credit unions.
Deutsche Bank is happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court.
The bank did not admit culpability in the settlement.
The same is true of Citigroup, which agreed to pay 20.5 million dollars.
The NCUA Chairman, Debbie Matz, welcomed the responsiveness of the two banks.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that can reach billions.
The current settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also approached other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in summer.
The dubious mortgage securities are mortgage-backed securities.
Their foundation is home loans.
This sealed the fate of several financial companies when the US property bubble exploded in 2007.
The US investment bank, Lehman Brothers, went belly up in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.
The banks fighting against strong wind in USA several years later.
investors and regulators have brought a large number of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has been behind the most claims.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken in US lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also faces legal action by the FHFA covering multiple transactions with a total value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for "substantial losses," but has not yet specified the exact sum.
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as baseless and has declared its intention to fend off the claims.
Warren Buffett pumps 10 billion into IBM
Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company, IBM.
Since March, he has acquired shares totaling more than ten billion dollars.
Since Warren Buffett, the most important American investor, Warren Buffett, has always claimed not to invest in IT and computing companies, as it was difficult to predict the long-term development.
However, IBM's annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and purchases computer systems for other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a Knighthood in the financial world.
The IT veteran IBM has now earned the title of "Sir IBM."
Buffett revealed that he has acquired IBM shares totaling 10.7 billion dollars since March on US business news broadcaster CNBC.
The investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM knew nothing of his involvement until recently.
The management has managed to generate profits even in the economic crisis.
They have done a great job, Buffett referring to the management strategy.
For a long time, IBM has focused on lucrative IT services such as data centres.
The computer pioneer - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett has not avoided technology firms since Buffett was appointed to the position.
The claim was only to invest in companies whose business he understands.
These are often invested in a railroad, such as a lubrifiant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer.
The holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns shares in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in 1960s and built it up, with clever investments, into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
The lifestyle has remained modest, but his lifestyle has remained steady.
making him a cult figure for many investors around the world.
The almost infallible ability to make money has earned him the nickname as the "Oracle from Omaha."
The IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following Buffett's investment.
Big Blue, as it is also known, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
Buffett has also said he is not planning to invest in Microsoft.
The founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
Emergency threat
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in Germany.
One newspaper describes a "bloody ideology" that is now resurfacing.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been the reaction to this report in Turkey and within the German-Turkish community in Germany.
The news brings back a long dead specter.
There was never a question that xenophobia is present in Germany.
The right-wing extremist network that has now been discovered is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood.
"Is this a re-awakening of bloody ideology?" was the headline of the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper reports that one of the perpetrators was a confidential informant for the Intelligence Services and says that Germany may be caught in the right-wing extremist quagmire.
The Turkish Community of Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering the victims of racial violence at a silent vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate on Saturday.
The Turkish Community in Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral contract on labour recruitment with German and Turkish politicians.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage by some Turkish media has been like a slap in the face.
The German edition of Hürriyet also does not shy away from this connection.
It is starting to stink, is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
The murders of people who paid taxes and made important contribution to Germany's redevelopment with their work.
The police behaviour and the successful hunt is highly criticised on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Writers even go far further than that, when things continue to be done so tightly, migrants have no choice but armed self-defense.
It will be the best self defence.
"Peace in Germany depends very strongly on how the whole network is uncovered and on the properness of punishment," says "Selen."
The attacks on Mölln and Solingen in the 90s are an example of what it means for peace in Germany to be at risk.
The photo of the burning out ruin of Solingen is deep in German and Turkish memory.
Other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a threat and showed the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to real violence.
The attacks, however, increase the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of past.
The Turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of German policy after the attacks.
The Turkish president sent a telegram of commiseration to the Turkish president after the arson attack in Solingen, but his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, took his place at the memorial ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel summarised the taxes Turks contribute in Germany, and explained how they contribute to Germany, and explained how they contribute to Germany, in his speech.
a person’s value is calculated by the taxes he pays.
The coverage by the Turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the current German state has become since.
Straight talking is needed now, alongside efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany.
Lake Zurich banking scandal
The most risk-taking bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the next ever since.
A German is now bringing it back into line.
Axel Weber certainly had not thought that would be his role.
After his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank, it was announced in July that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS.
Axel Weber was clearly happy, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity and making some friendly comments about his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to turn around."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
By September it was already clear that everything would be very different.
A UBS trader in London had bypassed all the security systems and stole around 1.7 billion Euros.
UBS CEO, Oswald Grübel - a banker not only famous in Switzerland - had to go.
The UBS Chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is asking: when will Axel Weber finally arrive?
Weber will be advised by the bank from February 2012.
The role of Chairman of the Board will be assumed in May, and not in 2013. The bank announced on Tuesday.
It will be a difficult time for Axel Weber.
The professor is an economics professor and central banker, not a conventional banker.
All at once, he is taking on the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has long been acknowledged to be the "biggest banking scandal in Europe."
UBS is both huge - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years.
The proud Swiss bank seems to be to be spared nothing.
It started in the financial crisis.
UBS had a good reputation until 2007.
The bank combined the image of the secretive and solid, but equally savvy asset manager with ambitious targets.
In 2007 UBS was managing 1.6 billion, which is more than any other bank in the world.
The World's biggest bank has climbed into the league of the world's biggest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
The former banker and long-standing banking professor at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich, Hans Geiger, explains: “I always presented UBS to my students as a model of good bank.”
From what we know today, you have to ask how I could have been so wrong.
The truth was very wrong.
It only appeared in 2007 that something was really going wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down.
Some months later we could guess why he left.
The investment division of the bank had become ill-equipped with subprime securities and was forced to write off billions.
UBS announced a capital increase, believe or not, of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis.
The bank actually managed to find investors, but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined - a less transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive, even its name was not disclosed.
The first blow was a very brief shock.
It got much worse in April 2008.
The bank announced new losses of billions and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, resigned.
UBS collapsed from lack of investment during the financial crisis and was saved by the state.
The National Bank acquired toxic securities from UBS for untold billions and the Swiss Federation paid six billion Swiss francs to become part owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks.
After all, the balance sheet total for UBS in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland (see chart).
UBS would not be able to survive for the second time.
The second catastrophe followed closely on the heels of the first.
Following a few months later, UBS capitulated in the USA tax dispute and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who could have potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay 780 million dollars, consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty.
UBS therefore more or less admitted to having been accessory to tax evasion.
However, UBS lost something that has always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secretion.
Swiss banking secret was not the same after the scandal.
The CEO and Chairman then resigned and the CEO and Chairman took their position.
The exodus of client money started.
The bank lost its credibility in both its core business areas - investment banking thanks to poor speculation and asset management by aiding and aiding tax evasion.
Soon after things started to calm and UBS looked like it would start to turn things around, a single trader took away 1.7 billion Euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in investment banking is still not working.
The Adoboli incident clearly shows that risk control had changed too little, says Martin Janssen, economic and professor of finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of one major German bank also has no doubts: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have a handle on risk control.
The concept of caution has long been a key pillar of world's major assets - no excessive risk, but security for money, whether the world fell apart outside Switzerland or not.
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli have become synonymous for sophisticated chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still adhere to the traditional Swiss private bank - just a bit bigger.
The location alone is classic.
The bank has its head office on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from main station directly to Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow-capped peaks of Switzerland.
The building is extravagant and the shop rates are among the highest in Europe.
Tiffany's are found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
The Swiss banks have lived here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The heavy revolving door opens into the UBS reception.
The walls are clad in marble behind large leather chairs.
UBS knows that its clients are looking for - security.
The major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have some time ousted the Swiss banking concept - or betrayed it, as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes.
The banker would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper - he also, like all Swiss bankers, works with the two major banks.
UBS has grown too big, particularly in investment banking where Anglo-Saxons are also very active.
In his opinion, Switzerland have nothing to add.
If they do, they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons long ago.
It was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, bringing in its first big profits - and then the debacle.
The catastrophe appeared on 15 October 2008.
The Wednesday, the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the country, says author Lukas Hässig in his book The UBS Crash.
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs (around 45 billion Euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
When talking to Swiss banks, they see the issue mainly in the size of UBS.
Two of the three major Swiss banks consolidated into a single, vast group in June 1998.
The bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow.
The fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other helped. One was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less wealthy but much more internationalised.
The internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
The banking research, Hans Geiger, says.
"Wuffli, highly intellectual, modest, with a deep understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel, with gut instincts who had worked his way up from being a bank apprentice."
Then Ospel took the opportunity to use Wuffli.
The critical error may have been a critical error. "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"That is tragic."
Tragic it may be.
Pride comes before a fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the management meetings where CEO Wuffli always repeated the same slogan - dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
It led the "league table" that documented the success of the banks at that time.
UBS wanted to get to the very top of the league.
It managed some way.
UBS was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks.
Commissioned management consultants pointed out a weakness. In terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as "fixed income," UBS was far behind the very large banks.
UBS had gaps in its US mortgage products.
To plug the hole, UBS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in US subprime securities.
It developed into a vast machine that packaged up US mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself carrying risks.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out, UBS kept on.
UBS was buying as late as summer 2007 when the US housing market was in flames.
The greater the rise, the greater the fall.
One manager after the next went on to clean up the building, as the efforts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated.
UBS posts became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day.
Any head of a major bank now has an almost impossible job.
The manager must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea - quit investment banking, focus on asset management and return to Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet prepared to go that far.
It is clear that investment banking must shrink significantly.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss banker was actually only thought of as a transitional solution when the bank parted ways with his predecessor Grübel.
Since then, he has proven his ability and is now appointed to head UBS permanently, the Swiss-based bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti plans to take the investment bank back to where it was in mid-90s.
He is closing 3500 jobs.
It will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
What is UBS?
How do it plan to make money?
The questions Axel Weber is probably already asking himself.
Publicly, he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe threatens US stock exchange
The threat of Europe to become a recession has depressed the mood of US investors at the start of the week.
The change in Athens and Rome had little impact.
Curbed industrial production on the continent could raise hopes that the debt crisis might get a settlement.
The general relief after the change of government in Rome and Athens was not sustained.
The Euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week, but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial stocks particularly were on the sales receipts.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 12,078 with a 0.6 percent fall.
The market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points during trading.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 point, down one percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Index lost 0.8 percent and closed at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax fell 1.2 percent to 5985 points.
17 Euro countries have significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of the upturn.
The Eurostat statistics office announced that in September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
The announcement made US investors sceptic. "We are not an island. We are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
The economist also claimed that Europe is not likely to recover quickly and that further signs of weakness in the banks are expected.
The investment legend, Warren Buffett, could only support such caution. In a CNBC interview, he said that Europe is still not strong enough to do all the needed to end the crisis.
In his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle out of the window to invest in the US technology industry.
The huge investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the veteran company's share price by nearly one percent against the trend during trading.
The shares closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett claims to have paid 170 dollars per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway fell 1.3 percent.

Intelligent crows are spreading in city areas.
Rooks are considered problem birds in many places. Experts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities.
While some like the birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible.
A solution to bird problems is however far from within reach.
Scientists at the first crow symposium in East Frisian town of Leer have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities.
Specialists from all Germany discussed possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in the city
Conservationists believe that migration of specially protected rodents was the root of the problem in cities, pointing to the use of chemicals in farming increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing development and felling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the bird.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian town of Soest and in the north-west in Jever, Diepholz, Achim bei Bremen and Leer.
The controversial project to cull crows in Leer caused negative headlines in 2005.
Critics described the capture of the birds in bird traps and how they were beaten to death with clubs as particularly brutal.
'Normal displacement and deterrence do not do anything', said town and country planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying off nests with water or cutting trees can have unwanted consequences, according to environment expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals disperse and large colonies split and spread to other areas."
Deterrence would only be possible as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes and schools.
"We have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the city will not be resolved, said Leer's mayor, Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of deterring birds from sensitive residential areas and providing incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" was the slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocated for a totally different approach to bird diseases.
Jürgens was a co-founder of the Ascherberg crow education trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where noticeboards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rook.
The project is already attracting interest from tourists.
Jennifer Jürgens also expressed her opinion on the noise the birds make. "The noise is a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of rooks are legendary. They often use tools to get hold of a choice morsel, but often create tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge recently tested the extent of bird intelligence on four rodents.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock over a platform to get to a moth larva.
They recognised the size and shape of stone needed to collapse the platform without much training.
In a second experiment, canny crows had to solve a more difficult problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers had supplied wire.
All four birds used the wire to form a hook and used the hook to fish the bucket out of the tube by its handle.
Three of four rooks even managed it at the first attempt.
Ronaldo rockets Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for last minute win were shortlived.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and Czech Republic, plus Ireland will be at the European Championship in 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have secured the final spot for the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Ronaldo scored in the 8th and 53 minutes, Portugal finished with a successful Euro appearance after a 0-0 first leg.
The Czechs only needed 1:0 (0:0) in the second leg against outsider Montenegro after a clear win in the first leg (2:0).
Croatia failed to play a trick with 0:0 against Turkey and Ireland managed an easy 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Fernando Nani (24th minute), Helder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goal for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic and captain Emir Spahic equalled the score with a converted 41st-minute penalty and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Bosnia had already been knocked out of the World Cup 2010 playoffs in South Africa against Portugal.
Portugal started off with a good start in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz.
Ronaldo knocked a free kick into the net from about 30 metres to take an early lead.
Then, a quarter of an hour later, Nani displayed his long-range skills, raising the lead to 2:0 from the 25 metre line.
The Bosnians, with no opening in the first half hour, had their first opportunity with goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from Manchester City sent a header to the bottom edge of the crossbar in 33rd minute but the ball failed to cross the goal line.
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
The referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding then took some attention.
Following an attack on Helder Postiga in the 36th minute, Stark decided the Portuguese player had simulated and gave him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a controversial handball penalty after a foul by Fabio Coentrao - Misimovic converted.
After half time, the European champions of 2004 settle the score with four more goals.
Petr Jiracek cleared any doubt for the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The European champions of 1976 are going to the Euro Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled on coach Michal Bilek's team and Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg).
Captain Petr Cech prevented a potential own goal from Tomas Sivok in the 9th minute with a split second reflex.
Montenegro had its best chances when Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were on the field.
Damjanovic took a shot from the edge of the penalty area that just missed Cech's goal in the 40th minute.
After half time, the crossbar saved Czechs' already battered world class goalie after the forward from FC Seoul retreated in 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before full time.
Turkey, meanwhile, was lacking football genius in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not do better than a 0:0 draw in Zagreb.
While it is now virtually certain that national trainer Guus Hiddink must now give up his seat on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croatians are now making the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed the perfect start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium.

Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level
The intensive and hugely emotional new book, The Beauty and Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long, dramatic personae that can make your heart sink.
Here is advice for proceeding: Gently excise this page and make it your bookmark.
The persons you will know are very well known in Mr Englund's novelistic telling, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when you are confused and stunned in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
The new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awardes the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, one he describes not inaccurately as "anti-history work."
The list is limited to big names, major treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, silly journalists or debate on tactics and material.
It is not so much a book about what happened as a book about what it was like. It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
The Beauty and Sorrow" threads together the experiences of 20 unremarkable men and women, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
A few will become prisoners of war, or lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker here like candles lighting in a church; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out.
Mr Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is a corrective to the notion that World War I was only about the dreadful trench warfare on the Western Front.
The Beauty and Sorrow successfully spreads across other theatres of war: the Alps, Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Warriors in the book have beehives fall on them; one has Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are a serious problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the start.
The War floods these people's lives like a natural catastrophe, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
If you are a woman at home with children, do you stay or flee?
Who is coming, anyway?
Almost no one understands what is happening, even why this war is to be fought.
Facts have been covered with guesses, supppositions, fears, illusions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.
The Beauty and Sorrow follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German high-seas carrier seaman.
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs, letters and other already published material.
The accounts of their lives can be threatening or stirring, but most fully alive are in Mr. Englund's accumulation of small moments, sparse details.
Many of these are about deprivation and doing.
In telling a German schoolgirl's story he says: "Replace, everywhere replace."
"Replace coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
The speech is about the ersatz food in Germany.
The describes "rice cooked in mutton fat (finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes soles with wood."
There are, he notes, "837 registered meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories about honor and bravery.
One American recognises his own desire to savagery and declares about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were intended for, rather than to sit in easy chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening paper or the best seller, and to pretend that there is no barbarian behind your stained and studded shirt front.
Conversely a British soldier believes that he will most likely die, and no one will notice or care.
Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it might happen in front of an audience.
Instead, it is horribly like "a condemned man being secretly swollen."
Other observations are about an old Europe going away, and about new types of terror.
The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition, Mr Englund says, "a war between factories."
The arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the articulate and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-cut clothes who performs his butchery while sitting behind a desk."
People act in unexpected ways; there is as much base behavior as heroism.
Commander Englund discussed the soldiers who actively try to catch venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
The most tragic expression of this is in the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in order to end up in hospital.
"Those who are really desperate rub it into their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is supple but unshown, very well suited to his human task.
In several small scenes he catches how the war has "uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been either negative, like Paul Fussell's Great War and Modern Memory, or novels, like Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, rather than comprehensive historical accounts.
Mr Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
The most devastating end I can remember in a nonfiction book.
I will not give it away.
It is as if he has reached from his book, snatched that dramatis personae page from your finger, and lighted it with a match.
After a Early Misstep, a Minutely Planned Raid is started After a Early Misstep, a Minutely Planned Raid is started After a Early Misstep, a Minutely Planned Raid is started
The riots were reported to have involved hundreds of police officers, some of them wearing riot helmets.
The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park was at its most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but few high-ranking officers, with some initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise.
Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence revealing how the operation was a challenge for the Police Department.
There cannot be no repeat of recent episodes, such as the pepper spraying of protesters, that violated department rules and created a public swell for the squatters.
The police operation to clear Zuccu Park of protesters took place after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials prepared by watching how other cities play out.
A major disaster drill was held on Randalls Island, with a view to Zuccotti.
Officials increased disorder training - counterterrorism measures that require quickly moving large police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move into the park came down at the last minute, according to a person familiar with the orders, who referred to the assignment as "an exercise."
The few cops I know that were called into this thing, they were not told it was for going into Zuccotti Park.
The only people who knew of them going into Zuccotti Park were at the very high levels of the department.
One reason for the secreteness was a lesson learned by the city.
On Oct. 14, officials wanted to clear the park but then backed off as hundreds of protesters streamed in ahead of the plans.
The operation on Tuesday included officers from various police units, including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers used to flood high crime neighborhoods.
According to Mr Kelly, many people, almost like commuters, have been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to move in.
It was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park.
Emergency Service Unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving out.
The lights and prerecorded messages seemed to choke many protesters.
As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were touched until 1:45 a.m., the police said, allowing the protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to move in if arrests were needed in the park.
Reports in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J Browne, the Head of the Police Department, said it was for their safety.
Many journalists reported that they were prevented from seeing the police take action in the park, and that they were roughly handled by police.
The photographer added that television camera trucks on Church Street, along the park's western border, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the dense jungle of protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with clothing, Sanitation Department followed, collecting what was left.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, the images appearing on the Internet soon after.
The core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment's kitchen area, in the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police moved in to catch them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the encampment locked themselves together by their hands.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The operation took about 75 minutes, police said.
Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests were for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest," he said.
The most senior officer on scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of department, the top uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T Pulaski, the department's head of detective work, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, while present, was not directing operations, Mr. Browne said.
The second group of officers waited on the western side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to move in.
Barriers were set at Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and at Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the area even further out of Zuccotti Park.
Then several officers, many with shields, were seen pushing people farther out.
About 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most rodents of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen releasing air from the tires of a police van.
One moment, a piece of plywood appeared from the crowd.
In the end, one officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Support Workers' Union Will Sue City Over Layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory, because they would have a disproportionate impact on poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, District Council 37 in its effort to reverse the layoffs.
SIX hundred seventy two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest paid workers died on Oct. 7, in a move that union leaders have described as political payback for their failure to access a labor-fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring.
City officials have categorically denied that accusation.
The City Council heard last month, Schools Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed off on in June.
One council member fired back, telling him that no funding provided for school support staff members.
officials said they filed a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued.
The suit will list Mr Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and counts eight laid off workers as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as were most of the aides who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the City Law Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
The draft of the complaint was obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequitable treatment, which the union has claimed to support a claim of inequitable treatment.
The report shows that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were let go in Districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
The loss of five out of eight school aides at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can fund-raise to make up the budget shortfalls."
P.S. 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student school enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" is more commonly defined as the act of moving a teacher from a school's payroll into a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
Sixteen parent coordinators were laid off, and not merely excessed.
Mission over, Congress ready to agree on Libya
The Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the revolt to succeed, longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and American involvement to end.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to consider a resolution, sponsored by Chairman John Kerry (D-Mass.), along with Sens. John McCain (R-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (I-Conn.) congratulating Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "bravery."
This resolution is about honoring the courageous people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.
The language may sound innocent, but nothing about Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, Republican and Democratic senators clashed with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the US military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military force in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never got a vote in the Senate.
The same day that bill failed in the House, the House also voted down a measure that would have cut American operations in Libya.
The US mission remained in a form of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission but not so upset as to pull the rug out from under it.
Then Congress's indecision was replaced by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed Oct. 20.
The NATO mission officially ended Oct. 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberation and commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.
The new measure will get full support from the Foreign Relations panel, or will it divide lawmakers like the June bill did?
The last version was opposed by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the top Republican in the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet.
Across the Capitol, the House is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budget, a top legislative priority for nearly every congressional Republican and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to get a floor vote in the House or Senate this Congress.
Other lawmakers have been unsuccessful in bringing their amendments to the floor, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte's is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates - the same bill offered in both the House and Senate - and others are slight variations on each other.
The balanced budget amendment is almost 15 versions in the House alone, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are similar, but they give their sponsors - particularly freshmen Republicans looking to burnish their resumes - the chance to brag that they "authored" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required that both the House and Senate vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, including Rep. José E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Senator Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has offered a host of amendments to guarantee quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is a perennial offering, as is one prohibiting flag-burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the nullification of federal laws if they are opposed by two-thirds of the States.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not moving at any speed than in past years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers offered 77 such amendments, and they introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is a little lower than in the 1990s, when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years, according to numbers supplied by the Senate Library.
They were not much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beat up but not beaten," Giffords says in first TV interview since shooting
Eight months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constituency event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Gifffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to the Broadway show tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to Congress.
While appearing on ABC News' 20/20 with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show documented her difficult journey back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of her brain, passing from the front to the back of her head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House to triumphally cast her vote on the debt-ceiling deal.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
When asked how she feels, Giffords, 41, replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourlong "20/20" special airing on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special tracking traced Giffords' recovery since Jan. 8 shooting.
In videos shot by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She is capable of holding up one or two finger as her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Head nod.
A rash of the lips.
And then she started with the first word: What.
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - toast, a request for change in her breakfast menu.
Television videos aired by ABC show that music plays a key role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to Cyndi Laupers' "Girls Just Wanna Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who goes through two hours of therapy every day, said she has no memory of the day of the shooting.
The husband told him that he was reading a newspaper story about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped him to ask about the six who have been killed in the incident.
Arrested shooter Jared Lee Loughner is being held in Missouri prison and is forcibly medicated as he awaits trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Tough, tight, tight."
Then, Kelly told Sawyer, she asked, "I have been beaten."
"So I would say, "Gabby, you have not been beaten," Kelly said.
You have been beat up.
It is going to get through this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever.
Warriors feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, several hundred soldiers, sailors and Marines stood in position around him.
The black-tie crowd rose to its feet and cheered.
The servicemen and women were considered as heroes, according to David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the gala, also attended by the then Chief of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
The children were rolled out like some sort of orphan kid, the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers acted well.
I know they did.
It was not respect, really. It was pity.
The starkly contrasting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken place between the military and a often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifice.
The praise comes with a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform.
They are not victims at all, said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
The only way that some can be supportive is by casting us in the role of hapless souls.
The topic is sensitive for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the later years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
The most common topics about pity occur quietly and privately among combat veterans.
After his two sons returning from combat tours with the Marines, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe because they faced down insurgents and travelled to exotic places.
Others might wonder if there was an angry, violent veteran under the surface.
While hunting for a job, he believed that some interviewers had asked if he could survive the strain of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
When you talk about your service, you need to counter the negative impressions.
The military's unease is mainly caused by American indifference to the wars.
Battlefield achievements rarely get praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
'We no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II' said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public focuses on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Volunteers are recognised for the number of tours they have taken, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
Military Faces Mounting Pressure to Crack Down on Rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for allegedly inaction on rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one.
Pfc. Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier.
Then she was heading back to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, just north of San Diego, after dinner with friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
Then he asked if he could join her in her room for drinks.
"A red flag went up," Lyman says.
The Texas native brushed aside her concern.
I thought no, he is 19.
"He is from Texas," she says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
In minutes Lyman entered Lyman's room, the man started walking down from behind her and raping her, she claims.
The week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will anxiously wait for a court decision in a historic hearing in Arlington, Va., that will decide whether a suit against Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The suit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to curtail widespread rape in the military, in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
Initiated in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., attorney, the suit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but changed to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all alleging that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is going after the military's top brass because the problem begins with them.
The military is a top-down structure, she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in position to eradicate retaliation culture? The top leadership."
Burke says that since February she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, many of whom could be part of future suits.
The strategy: rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one basket - she will file multiple cases if needed to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court papers, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces.
The 1950 Supreme Court rule called the Feres Doctrine states that the federal government is not liable for injury sustained by active-duty personnel.
The alleged harms are incident to plaintiffs' military service, the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, that distinction is in name only: modern wars rarely have clear frontlines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers are increasingly playing important roles, especially in reaching out to local women in war zones.
The result: between the two wars, 150 women have died - two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time for the military to modernize, Burke says.
She is not alone in her fight; three other lawsuits are underway including hers.
The Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering misogyny.
Additionally, the Vietnam Veterans of America is assembling a suit against the military that focuses on the "personality disorder" diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of Service Women's Action Network, a human-rights group.
The group filed a suit in December against the Veterans Administration, charging it with discriminatory practices in handling claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a range of fixes.
In 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
The threats are notoriously underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimate, that figure represents about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as the first of a series of traumas.
Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour later.
The night, she says, she was asked to recount the details of her rape 11 different times to a stream of police, doctors and commanders.
She did a rape kit, and the blood from the cutting on his arm was found in her bed.
Six months later, April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge, during which she was questioned about having sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going into labor - I ran screaming from the courtroom."
They put me into the psychiatric unit and I remember telling my command officer, "That was not his trial. That was my trial.""
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged under less than honorable terms, preventing her from any benefits.
The case filed by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs is a long shot, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he says, "I believe they should be able to move forward."
What is between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first issued.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because they do not have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability.
The odds are heavily against them, but it is important for them to try.
This only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not go their way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will cue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
While we continue to fight the military on this issue, we will continue to fight the military on this issue until reform occurs.
When we die, whichever comes first.
Shutters have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy spreading his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to a July killing spree in Norway that left 77 people dead, faces his first public hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much of his time leading up to his attack at his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After this summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
How do they get them?
Easy - just log on to Facebook.
Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by British think tank DEMOS.
However, the database is so huge, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their target population with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the ads asked users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their future.
By reaching through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues could survey over 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
It is quite new way of doing research, Bartlett says.
Some results are not all that surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and very sensitive to immigration.
In a twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen.
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
The site is used by think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in 'Likes', wall posts and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding average three pieces of content per day, the Facebook data supernova is generating a research boom, driving the number of academic papers with the site's name in the title up almost 80% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you cannot approach with a clipboard on the street.
Before, when you try to survey people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.
They would never allow you access to the party.
"Facebook cuts all that out - you go directly to them."
Others believe the site could offer a way to identify and tackle social health problems.
The recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drinking exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who remained silent on the topic.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as residential advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many boozy status updates.
Dimitri Christakis, co-author and Director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed.
Facebook is constantly tapping into its own population for data.
The Data Team has worked on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in 2010 midterm, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using information only it can access - champions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research.)
The site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
What about when Facebook users become part of a survey they do not even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline, online it is free for all.
Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, says of a 2006 study conducted using students' public Facebook profiles.
As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends.
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of a user's profile information and wall posts are true.
'What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things' says Selwyn.
The reason is that, despite his years as a technology researcher, clipboard and pen are still the best research tools any person can use.
There is no alternative to going into the real world and speaking to real people.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still occurs offline."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik Makes First Public Court Appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public court appearance in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar Norway," he told a courtroom packed with 500 people.
"I object to the court because you receive your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I accept the act but I do not plead guilty."
Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for his views."
The same reason he refused to allow Breivik to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from accessing media for four weeks and ordered tight control over all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and victims' relatives attended the hearing.
Some came to look at Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key.
All attended with the goal of moving towards closure.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," one Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me I moved on little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
While wearing dark suits and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at journalists and survivors as he enters and exits the building.
Although Breivik's strange notion of being part of a large "resistance" movement, the judge found that he is not infected and that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
It does not automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," a relative of one victim said.
It would be so much easier if he did.
7 Lessons From the Lost Steve Jobs Interview, Showing at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on Oct. 5, some people compared him to Henry Ford - calling him the Great Modern Inventor.
The most revealing thing to Apple fans is the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was released in advance of special movie screenings in major markets this week, about how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
The man was certainly a designer, dreamer and self-described hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow-chart tweaker - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from "a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90% of the work... but there is a tremendous amount of crafting between a great idea and a great product."
Then in 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a rare, long conversation.
At that time it had been roughly 10 years since Jobs was forced out of Apple, and he was already working at his new computer company NeXT, looking to the growing adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he says that the master copy of the interview went missing in shipping.
The VHS was only found after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly reedited, is the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, coming to Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to loathe detailed interviews, Jobs seems to be a bit more eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15-second ruminations, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, aiming for precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism rises to the surface, where he seems to be anxious about Cringely's questions, leading him to move faster to issues or subplots of greater import.
The Lost Interview is a very interesting film, as Jobs assesses what other companies do and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs career, but there is something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
The vision for how things can be and should be.
After spelling it all out he went and did it.
The short list of seven Lost Interview sequences:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout my years in business I always ask why you do things? And the answers I always get are: "Oh, that's the way it is done.""
Nobody knows why they do what they do, nobody really thinks about things very deeply in business.
That is what I found.
Jobs continues to detail his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
When he was confused by how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was then adjusted with a "variance" - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second.
On pranking Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
The device has been widely written about before, but Jobs' euphoria in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is infectious.
Then he describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, placing a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible.
They were going around the world half dozen times and you would yell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the next door pay phone.
We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.
Us two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I cannot imagine there would ever be Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and Wozniak nearly pulled off, ringing the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope.
The two burst into laughter when the Pope himself appeared to answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and cold-calling Bill Hewlett):
Then at 12, while looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gave him a call.
Then, a short phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
The only company I saw at that age was the only company I saw at that age and it formed my view of what a company was and how they treat their employees.
Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's Palo Alto research labs, where he saw the first desktop computer ever made.
It was as large as a suitcase, had a small cathode ray tube display, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a ride up to HP as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it.
Improving innovation:
At several points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he set out to sell a handful of circuit boards, he was asked to build the full computer.
Working on only 30 days of credit, he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
After coming to Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments...they were screaming at me that it would take five years to build a mouse that would cost $300. I got fed up and went outside and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse we could build for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
On great companies losing steam:
Then, before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs consciously anticipated how so many industry leaders would fall in line with their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make better copier or printer, so what?"
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing makes it more successful, so those people who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision-making forum.
The product genius that led to that monopolistic position is rotted by people who have no conception of good products vs. bad products - the craftmanship required.
That is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, could have been Microsoft of the 90s...
They took defeat from victory.
Innovation as art form:
"There is a tremendous amount of craftmanship between a great idea and a great product... as you evolve that great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are tradeoffs you have to make - certain things you cannot do electrons do, glass do, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together...
The most important thing is to try to expose yourself to the best human work, and then try to bring that into your work.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.
The part that made the Mac great was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would be doing amazing things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas meet with healthcare law challenger as court takes case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama's healthcare law, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were toasted at a dinner hosted by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when all nine justices meet for a conference to pour over the petitions for review.
One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists nationwide.
The justices agreed to hear the suit, and the outcome is likely to roil the 2012 presidential race, which will be fully swung by the time the court's decision is released.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as US Solicitor General in the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longstanding group dedicated to advocacy of conservative legal principles.
The firm that hosted the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenge the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Other sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has an enormous financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's conference on the case.
In attendance was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and a long-time advocate of the healthcare law.
The featured guests at the dinner are Scalia and Thomas.
It's not new: The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
It is nothing that goes against ethics rules.
In fact, justices are exempted from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices.
If they were, they probably fell under code's Canon 4C, which states, "A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations but the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor or featured on the event's program."
The proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well to a large financial interest in the case, was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists.
”This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code is a shock to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
The justices were eating and drinking at a black-tie fundraiser with lawyers with pending cases before the court.
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too often mix the court business with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a highly profiled conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as Solicitor General in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level.
The Critics have asked for Kagan to withdraw from hearing the case, adding that she was too involved in defending the law then to be independent now.
Kagan has no indication she will do so.
Boeing gets record $18 billion jetliner order
Emirates airline orders 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jetliners with option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It is rare news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
It’s a big deal when the company is airplane-maker Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 airplanes totals $18 billion.
The same is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years will need 2,520 airplanes worth $450 billion.
Boeing on the weekend announced its biggest order by dollar value for commercial airplanes - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777 jets.
The blockbuster order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy 20 more planes, which would increase the total list price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then Monday, Boeing announced Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner.
List price for six of those is more than $1 billion.
Boeing is clearly a positive for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
The quality of these particular customers is pretty strong.
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oil-producing countries.
They have the money to pay for planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually damaged by airlines because it is a major cost - is not as detrimental as a rise in oil prices.
The important thing is that they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural hedge," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's lead in the wide-body aircraft market and helps hold Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market.
Boeing's win at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would push back the launch of the largest A350, which will compete directly with the 777-300ER.
It was delayed to add more thrust after customers requested more payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico president's sister apparently defeated in Michoacan vote
Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped candidate Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governor's race.
Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan in violent state elections, and she alleges that drug traffickers helped tip the race for her opponent.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the Western state governor to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
Crime intervention during the whole election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview on Sunday.
They seized ballot boxes, set roadblocks, and ordered people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
It is steadily coming back, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is aiming to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have only a few slight margins to Calderon, who had led the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the governorship, came in third, a poor defeat for the divided and hapless left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote.
Aureoles also declined to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and asked the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence has continued.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates quit local races out of fear.
The PRI, though, however nasty the election looks, a win will help the party's momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidency, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking forward to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called for India and China to be prepared to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to prevent a long-term downturn that will slow the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Managing Director of the Manila-based ADB, stressed that the two fastest-growing large economies had to do their best to speed the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral arrangements.
The WHO warned against Bric countries looking at Europe's difficulties in a "dispassionate way" and called for Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources would prevent long-term global collapse.
"We are all in this together."
Everyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful.
"Asia may be shielded to some extent but it cannot be immune."
If China and India can help, all means are guaranteed.
Europe's monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent years, Italy's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The unfolding sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for emerging economies to join forces to help the eurozone find a solution.
IMF would be the only channel for Asian support, but bilateral assistance - like buying the bonds of the EU's bail-out fund, the European financial stability facility - offered greater bargaining power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's minister of trade, said that India will do whatever it can to help the Eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and drying up of foreign capital flows.
Nobody wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent, he added.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?
Others argue that developing economies like India have no business helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges.
Asutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically difficult to sell assistance to Europe to India's 1.2bn people, of which about 800m live on about $2 a day or less.
They may discover that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on beach holiday and it will not go well.
Lee Howell, the Managing Director of World Economic Forum, also questioned why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's many and well paid public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed, loss-making utilities like railways.
The Eurozone crisis threatened "significant knockout effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "risks on the downside" because of Europe's threat.
The chairman added that vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Defense warnings from Pentagon on potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta took the heat on Congress Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to civilians.
The Pentagon is digesting $450 billion of cuts over the next decade but now fears additional $600 billion or more in cuts if Congress cannot agree on spending.
The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department, Panetta told the Senate leaders John McCain, R-Arizona and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
The congressman added that failure to reach a budget agreement and resulting sequestration would result in 23% across-board reductions and a halt to many new projects.
According to Panetta, such a large cut would render most of our ship and construction projects unexecutable, you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building, and seriously damage other modernization efforts.
Because the reduction would be so quickly, we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians to meet the target.
These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness.
The cuts would eventually hit combat troops, Panetta said.
While the funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester, war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets, Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be cut, resulting in delays in contracts and contract oversight that support the war.
"Payroll personnel would be cut, resulting in late payments to wartime vendors, and legal and policy support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
The consequences of a sequester on the Defense Department would set a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power.
Senators called for this draconian action, they said.
This is not an outcome that we can live with, and it is certainly not an outcome that we should impose on ourselves.
The sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not occur.
The letter and the new warnings from Senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts.
Panetta has become more aware of possible cuts, although he came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices.
The Secretary of Defense painted a bleeding picture of what could be ahead, a military with a shell but no core.
It is a ship without sailors.
It is a brigade without bullets.
It is an air wing without enough trained pilots.
The paper tiger is a paper tiger, a Army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to fulfil the mission.
It is a force that suffers low moral, poor readiness and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.
"In effect, it invites aggression.."
In addition to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta defined new specifics of how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay response time to crises, conflicts, and disasters; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
The threat to the ax is expected to be a major defense project, including those already tested and some in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Marines need to replace the humvee.
Delays in development and testing the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital step to upgrade and meet potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
The recent headlines indicate how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading sexual harassment claims with several women, each side accusing the other of lying.
Auditors at Penn State have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys.
The French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open mic threatening to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed career and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet flasher Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence.
Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover-up of an extra-marital affair.
Then again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton unleashed during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife.
There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers to make them look good on their performance reviews.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are accepted.
How much deceit do we get?
On a given day, studies show you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Many of those are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Detecting lies, or "lie spotting", is an essential skill for everyone to acquire, both personal and professional reasons.
Deception detection is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
The result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look at you in the eye.
They do not always steer, slump, smirk or fidget.
Do not conclude from this that liars are difficult to spot and unmask.
A trained lie spotter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure, facial micro-expressions, question formation and time.
Since I spent several years exploring the scientific findings in the vast and ever-growing body of deception knowledge, I have become aware that deception detection is a modern skill that can be learned and helpful in navigating our complex world, especially if you have a professional role in hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled in reading others well, putting them in ease, managing their emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
According to research, extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented" lies than women tell more "other-oriented" lies - usually to protect someone's feelings, and that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people do (but the lies they do tell tend to be whoppers).
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilt in lying to you.
How do you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe your subject's normal behavior.
This is called baselining.
It provides a reference point for later assessments.
Notice your subject's posture, laugh, vocal quality.
You should know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you can avoid unjust accusations when you see foot-tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clusters of deceptive verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these clusters red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceptive people may freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story, they may lean towards an exit, shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit post-interview relief - an exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture after all the hard questions have been answered.
Interrogators often falsely signal that an interview is over to look for post-interview relief.
Also, consider your subject's language.
Scott Peterson famously slipped and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
Deceptive individuals may also use distance language: " I have no sexual relations with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a hard question in its entirety.
Most common verbal indicators are subtle.
They may use lots of "qualifying language" when answering a hard question: "Well ... I will tell you the truth as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge."
This renders the answer perceptual rather than fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic bullet for detecting lies, but developing skills to ferret out deception is possible.
This skills will enhance any person's chances of avoiding victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial Oil Pipeline Plan to Be Rerouted After Threat of Delayed US Approval
Following the Obama administration's threat to delayed the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, the company seeking to build the pipeline is willing to reroute the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident the project will still get approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company is confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved, albeit with a different route.
The announcement follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underground water supply.
Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department likely would push off any decision until 2013, after the next year's elections.
Secretary of State Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's call, and expressed support for it.
The pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so would require it crossing six states.
It is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups, who have secured the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
The plan is being considered to force a move away from Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current Environmental Impact Study found the project would have limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source added that the Department's inspector general has ordered a separate review of the project, focusing on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle is sued for causing child to vomit out of fear
The New York family claims that the famous disco diva Patti LaBelle took a rampage in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrorizing their toddler daughter to the point where she collapsed in fear.
The singer's threat shocked her to "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family says in the Manhattan Supreme Court suit.
Then it was November 10, when stagehand Kevin Monk, his kindergarten-teacher wife, Roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk walked down to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their bags, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "You know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and went to pick her up.
LaBelle threatened the pregnant woman.
"She aggressively threatened to leave your daughter by the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, "I have no interest in what you say or think.'"
Then she started using profanities, C-word and F-word in a loud voice ...
She had a bottle of water and started flicking water from the bottle on me.
Genevieve got hysterical.
"I asked this woman, "Look what you have done to my daughter," the child's mother said.
LaBelle lunged at her mother, who was still holding Genevieve, and was taken to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The ttot was crying so hard that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking for an apology from LaBelle but no response was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return calls for comment.
The family's lawyer, Sam Davis, took the case for free and plans to donate any money they get to a children's cancer charity.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct," Davis said.
”That is completely unacceptable, especially when aimed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.
The climate adversity slowed the economy.
During the first year of Mario Lopez Valdez management, in Sinaloa increase the unemployment and informality, foreign investment declined and the economy was reduced.
Since 2011, Sinaloa has a year that will be remembered for its economic history, being related to the first year of Mario Lopez Valdez government, which generated great expectations for the economic development of the region, but due to the climate adversity of the first year of Mario Lopez Valdez government, there was no growth, but the main economic indicators declined.
The low February temperatures not only caused losses for the agriculture sector, but also limited the potential of the state economy to grow, causing a general contraction of the economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly supported by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected other economic sectors.
The report on the damaged areas caused by the frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, reported that 78.03 percent of the affected areas suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage.
The fall in economic activity has resulted in a constant increase in unemployment in the state, from January to March 55,053 Sinaloa citizens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter the rate changed to 5.28 percent, and between July and September the rate continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in terms of number of people represents more than 74.000 unemployed Sinaloa citizens.
Lower liquidity
While unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multi-factorial, for economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the public policy action.
These are increasing unemployment which is caused by several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constraint in the Congress to combat money laundering.
Stopped Immigration
Lopez Cervantes added that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
The number of people who leave the state in search of a job abroad has been restricted, first of all due to the difficulty to enter and secondly because they have too many difficulties in finding a job, that group of people is staying and demanding jobs in the state, causing unemployment to rise.
Informality
The labor market analysis of Sinaloa gets worse when considering the high level of informality in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the active population in the state works without being listed as workers to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another state labor reminder is low wages; the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The monthly average income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5.352 pesos, well below the national average of 7.375 pesos.
Contracts for FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment rate, in 2011 the state foreign direct investment totaled 630.697 dollars, which represents a 87.74 percent decline compared to the same period last year.
The State Government’s Economic Development Ministry accounted for a total investment of 17.280.000 pesos in the year, mainly occurring in tertiary sector companies.
Debt
Following the economic downturn, the state government asked for a credit of 3 billion pesos, which would be for the investment in 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of Mario Lopez Valdes government shows a lack of capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of various sectors, including the state government itself.
The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been very poor, we have to work hard to regain the ground lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good and coordinated effort of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better.
Economic slowing
Lopez Loredo said that the events such as early frost this year restricted the state economy and its performance and growth was restricted.
The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost, which does not turn fast enough to produce an acceptable flow of the processes, products and services and thus, at the end of the year we are closing it below our expectations.
Redefining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Association of the Republic of Sinaloa, said that the state must prosecute the most dynamic productive activities.
Overall, we found that there has been work on, we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that defines the vocation and economic course of the state, it is important to detonate all the material and human potential resources that Sinaloa has.
Work to Do
Coparmex President stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide the government efforts.
Overall I would say that the Government has been trying to be successful in several fields, in terms of economic development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term program.
The current administration has shown progress in its own way of leading public policy.
There are elements that allow us to say that the government is becoming more inclusive, and I think the government is aware of the work to be done.
The prisoners have him for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days was the sentence given to a Navolato citizen for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Attorney Office reported that the drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for trade.
According to the record AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican Army on June 7th 2010, in a surveillance operation on street Cipriano Valdez, in front of the post 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in the box of the vehicle and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
The insured was given to the Second District Court and the sentenced person continues to be a prisoner at the Center for Legal Consequences of Crime.
There must be contributed to works.
The social works referred to in the programs Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk not to be completed or have serious delays due to lack of fund, said Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development added that although the work programs have progressed they are at risk because the State Government failed to provide the necessary contribution, which represents a resource of over 11 million pesos in all three programs.
The total investment in these three programs is around 50 million pesos, of which the State has to contribute with 25 percent and only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works.
They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime, since starting with July they have to give us a part, but we need the money.
The Mayor added that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with its contribution, so that the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, a sum that was not provided by the State administration.
Since the previous administration we had no financial capacity to participate and the programs continued to advance, and this year we needed to get the resources to cover what the State left pending.
Although the state authorities have committed to delivery of these resources, he asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the efforts to get the percentages that correspond to them as quickly as possible.
They have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime.
The court validates "digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) rejected the constitutional disputes against the President’s decree that shifts the so-called "digital television transition" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not obtained.
The majority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the action to take to achieve the digital terrestrial television transition.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate, was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes to judge on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The sentence project prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television materials is a law-given power to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contradict the decree, and to support the claims, the minister suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there in the digital transition.
At the ministers meeting they also agreed to reject the claim filed by the Deputies, without involving the project discussion, also under the Ministry of Agriculture.
In his speech, the minister said he was not agreeing with the arguments of the project in that the federal executive cannot structure general rules for preparedness measures.
However, I do not consider that if made would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body, which has a constitutional mandate, and the State's guidance.
The replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes in the world in recent years, and results in better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The change, he added, would mean delaying the benefits of digitization, which involves a public interest decision, which includes economic, social, political and national security issues.
This issue, he added, "requires the operation of the whole system established under the principle of state economic stewardship, which is a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the state executive power."
The executive has now completed the digital transition, and has done it through the Executive, despite highly specialized technical bodies.
The government, by issuing the contested decree, that invades in any way the competence of the Congress, is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the Legislature, he added.
The authors analyse the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán.
The difference between first and second place in the governorship election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 of the total of 6.074 minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in Michoacán, where the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes that represent 879 of the total 6.074 minutes.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of Michoacán Electoral Institute (MEI), Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, referred to the recently approved set of guidelines to harmonize local regulations with the federal electoral reform.
The State Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the State Election Justice Act was not authorised, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the periods specified in the Law in the State Official Gazette, arguing that he had some objections.
The same November 9th, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) resolved the constitutional controversy between the local legislature and described it as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms, since he has no right to sanction or vote them.
When asked about the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria de los Angeles Llanderal stated that with the appropriate guidelines by the MEI General Council it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
The partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur when: the results of the records do not match; the count on the box record is not included in the president’s power; or when obvious errors or alterations in the minutes are apparent.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when the difference between the alleged winner of the election and the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates has been given by the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates.
The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point, as long as there is a request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position, and there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount.
The most important example of such a situation is the election of Morelia, where the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
The last will be his will
The ashes will be distributed in the mountains of Zapalinamé, according to the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortes arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night; on Monday the investigation and requiem mass were held.
The last wish of the Lieutenant Colonel was to spread his ashes in the mountains of Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute and other persons who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortes returned to Coahuila on board of a Mexican air force aircraft, the closest people attended the funeral at Campo Marte.
The ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the chapel located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza street, where family and friends were coming.
At 5:30 in the afternoon he received the recognition of the Technological Institute of Saltillo organized by his former high school classmates and the football team that Felipe Bacio was part of during his high school preparation.
The pilot's wish was to return to Saltillo, and his ashes to be spread in the mountains of Zapalinamé, he always told his family and friends.
The Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, he was a successful man, an extraordinary father, son and a loving brother and a loving brother.
Felipe Cortes Bacio left very young the city of Saltillo to enter the Air College in Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but always wanted to fulfil his dream of being a pilot.
The nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person, "just arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as he brought Martha Sahagun to Saltillo.
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for graduation of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died while doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
The last farewell is given to him.
The last shots were fired for the lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Bacio, headed by the Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, the people of the village and the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, managers and students of the Technological High School of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and made himself famous both in study and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died last days when the helicopter he piloted collapsed, along with Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of this department.
At 18:05 the remains of Bacio Cortés (cremated), a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be given by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major James Martinez, on the esplanade of the training school, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies are left in the NL Cadereyta farm.
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented in media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for organized crime.
Three men were found dead in different parts of the body and with the grace of the shot, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jimenez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery occurred at kilometer 1.5 of the Cadereyta road to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
The few people who visited the site noticed that in the country-house, which has beige with brown, the gate was wide open.
Then looking in the direction of about three meters, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the relevant authorities.
One of the men wore yellow t-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and near him was a man with white under vest.
At about one meter there was another individual with red shirt and blue jeans.
Three were face down.
The data obtained from the site indicate that the three persons were killed in another place, since there was no cases on the site.
The fence of the country house has legends from one organized crime group to another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 are captured in Cadereyta.
The National Defense Secretariat made the presentation of the 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta, which is accused of abductions, killings and clandestine burials.
The release of information shows that initially on November 11th in the colony of Los Alvero there were arrested eight people and one person who remained deprived of his/her liberty was rescued.
The prisoners were given three homes and a cell phone, claiming to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas."
The other event occurred on November 12th at 06:00 am, when the military personnel took a surveillance tour in the village Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, seeing a car without number plates and two men on board.
By stopping them and making the inspection, the military found a rifle, a chamber and 18 cartridges.
After these statements, on November 13th at 14:00 one of his accomplices was stopped in the common land of La Pravda, who seeing the military tried to escape.
The suspect is accused of clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
Wednesday the new Italian government will be formed.
The new Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian president to present the new government that will tackle the crisis that has sent Italy on the edge of economic disaster.
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of a economic disaster and has threatened the whole euro zone.
The statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government.
The new executive will present a large cabinet of technocrats, but it is unclear when the new executive will take the position.
Monti says he will present to the president the results of his meetings with the political parties in his effort to form a government.
”I want to confirm my complete confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult phase,” he told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well delineated," he said.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy has been in a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must agree to a harsh austerity package asked by the European leaders to regain Italy’s confidence.
The markets kept Monti awaiting the deadline to delay, which would have given Italy a 10-year yield of 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to rescue.
Emma Marcaglia, head of the Italian Employers' Federation, told the reporters after meeting with Monti:
This government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
They believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have good results, according to Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had supported the technocrat government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support for implementing the reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure by warning that failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday his consultations with the political parties, unions and business groups, as well with youth and women organizations.
The meeting will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short rest last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs now reach critical levels between uncertainties about who will succeed.
Rescuing Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion Euros would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Euro zone.
Monti has announced that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013.
Monti would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made of technicians, a warning to his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure.
Political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the effort to include political figures.

The World and Europe champions, number one in the FIFA monthly top, have a long record of Class A international selection, and the Tricolors have only the defender Michael Umana as the only one who has 50 international games.
The number was reached Friday before the game against Panama (0-2), in Rommel Fernandez.
Spanish football players playing in the All Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and high level shocks in European Cups and Champions League.
This is added to the Spanish Fury experience in complicated Euro and World Cup qualifications.
Ticos players have limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
The peak of the Spanish selection is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (game lost with 0-1 in London) equals the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches.
Sergio Casillas will play today against the Tricolors and will establish a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Xavi Hernandez, the player of Barcelona, has 106 matches.
Xavi and Casillas were recognised last week by UEFA together with the other player of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta with 126 matches and Schalke striker Raul Gonzalez with 102.
The nearest centennial number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres, with 90, Sergio Ramos and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Iniesta, with 62, Cesc Fabregas, with 62, and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are left-handed Junior Diaz, with 48 matches and defender Bryan Ruiz, with 45 matches.
After this, only five players exceeded 30 games: Kevin Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The most.
More than 30 matches in Spain have Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, less than 30 appearances are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of the rest does not come close to the 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one game and Nelson Edder has not debuted yet.
The most successful player of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that has more points, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet took the country on tour to celebrate two decades of experience.
'Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true'
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
The band says that for the member it was a dream turned into reality playing in the country.
This was stated by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on South American zone within the tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20th will make its only stop in Central America.
The day will be held at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, together with the band of Los Angeles The X and the nationals Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, which is available in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
Although I have only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it is a beautiful country and I think we can stay for a few days there.
Then we are excited to bring our music to the city.
I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band; the fans live with intense intensity the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people when they hear your concert describe it as the most important show of the year.
What is this?
Some of the most important shows we have played over the past 21 years occurred in the last couple of weeks.
We had a few wonderful shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has prepared us for the Costa Rica concert.
Really, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love surf and the jungle, for both things Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible.
My friends always go to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, and that's how we learned about surfing through people who love surfing.
Viewing the tour, one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs.
What are you preparing for the presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never played there before, there are no restrictions on what we can do.
The best show possible will be with a good variety of songs, we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you get involved?
It is partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's difficult to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that have not been played for a while, it keeps us focused and surprises because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked them and that we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people.
With this tour you are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all you have made?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I think no one of us could ever imagine we would be in a rock band and doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We count on Blessings and we are very excited to continue making music together.
We all love each other and love making music.
We are fortunate to travel to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
The things cannot be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are good friends of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual.
The usual sight of a city is a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands emerge from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them sometimes.
The last year we were in Canada with Alice in Chains and we saw Soundgarden in its tour, so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that aroused.
It is also strange that a band like yours remains united with same members for so long.
Together we have been for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is a long time than many bands lasted.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and secondly, we all care about others.
We are close friends and, thanks to this, there have also been open musical avenues that allow each to experiment.
We trust each other with our music and this cannot be better.
Your relationship to fame has not been easy, but thanks to your success you have been able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find balance.
We take care not to be too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
While people are there for the music, that reminds you to respect the music and what it brings, without thinking about being famous and being a rock star, something that no one really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Manother Love Bone?
I think we write good songs and at the beginning was a great thing.
We were almost three years in a band and never released a single album until after the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
The most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and always laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
It was a remarkable man and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
What do you know about the work of Eddie Vedder?
The production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band we liked most.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
The song is very catchy and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bassist, what influences influence you?
There are so many.
Within the first that come to my mind are Jerry Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam maintain grunge relevant despite being no longer a fad?
I think all of us feel disconnected from the word grunge.
If I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came at the same time.
The first recording had darker content, and now has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
The album is interesting because there are a couple of songs on the album that may sound lighter but they can sound positive.
With both, when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them.
The two songs represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests.
The ex President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for loss of muscle strength in legs, according to his family doctor.
FUJIMOR, 72 years old, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including cancer of the tongue, which has been operated four times and is kept under control.
The Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N of television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in order to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
However, he believed that Fujimori would be a candidate for pardon on humanitarian grounds, but he believed he was innocent.
The patient has surgery four times for tongue cancer, weight loss of 18 kilos, added to other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, high blood pressure and legs circulation problems, according to the doctor.
Fujimori is in prison since September 2007 in the Police National Department of Special Operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for killing 25 people at the hands of a squad of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to address regional issues.
Calderon will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the schedule released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in Guadalajara, will be "favourable for the exchange of information on the issues between the two countries," as published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to get Calderon's support for Uruguay in the crisis with France that occurred when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that remain tax havens, a statement that caused Uruguay’s rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in Europe.
Mexico has presided since November, the G20, a group composed of the world's most powerful developed and emerging countries, and has in effect with South America since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to prevent double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange arrangements in order to leave the “gray list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is composed of countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
On the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between both countries.
The mustachied plumber becomes three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Since the early years of his life, Mario has tried to save Princess Peach from the evil clutches of Bowser, but never before he has done this in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for her in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to the world this month, is designed to exploit the features of the potable Nintendo 3DS, which allows playing in three dimension without glasses.
Mario is the character who has to tell how it should work stereoscopy without glasses, according to the press head of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez.
Alvarez added that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support," because previous successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
According to Nintendo spokesman, the game is "accessible" and allows quick and fluid play.
Alvarez added that the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
After pasting, most experts will give a second round to the level of the play, which this time, are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action but will need to play in three dimension to overcome the various challenges and "not to suffer optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions also represents the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this game Nintendo winks to fans of the series and repeats the success of previous games, the bearded plumber will have to walk through dangerous platforms to free Peach.
Although the player will find new movements, the surroundings, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States.
Mexican President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that the extradition process of the ex leader Alfonso Portillo has begun to respond to the United States of laundering $ 70 million.
The process ends with Guatemala responding to the request of north country that claimed Portillo to be judged there.
The decision is based on the independence of judiciary and executive powers, taking account of the fact that a trial court had already ordered the extradition.
The mandate states that he did not "put his hands" in judicial decisions and accepted all extradition proceedings he has ever seen.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What is done by Colom represents an Executive Process after exhausting all legal and constitutional courts to prosecute the ex head of state between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was acquired of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Defense Ministry when he was a president, which was the process that followed the extradition.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk.
The entity was created to prevent the falling on the margins of the society of untrained young men.
The balance of the first 25 years of Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this century quarter.
To this there are added over 100 jobs currently created for this social group.
The anniversary was a balanced event held in the old factory complex Fabra i Coats, where over 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, no job, and drug problems or at risk of being marginalised.
The yesterday celebration at Sant Andreu attracted a large number of responsible bodies and institutions that in the past 25 years have collaborated with the Association.
The diverse political representation, in election time, showed the unitary character of Trinijove’s work.
Next to the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the ceremony the ex counselor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the ex lieutenant of the mayor and current eco socialist Councilman Ricard Goma.
Also attended the Fabra i Coats the current Social Welfare and Family Counselor, Josep Lluís Cleries and CEO of La Caixa Social work, Jaume Lanaspa.
The researcher added that Trinijove was born in a difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far is good.
The president gave Trinijove as an example for fighting against the circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties.
The crisis is not new to the entity and the work done by it.
Occupated farm where macro parties were given was evacuated.
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without fighting.
The nightmare lived by the neighbors living in 51 Balmes Street has ended.
Eight people left their illegal property yesterday at noon, and organized large parties that would have shocked the neighborhood, by court order without police intervention.
After the operation the door lock was changed to prevent repeating the situation.
"From now there will be access control," said the manager.
The squatters, who invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest are inhabited, painted the walls and left all sorts of residue, including alcoholic drink cans.
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and stunned the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied her business went down 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the farm made her unfair competition, since they were selling drinks for three Euros, while in the club it was 10 Euros.
In addition, the owner of the disco had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise, while, as she noted, the noise was not caused by the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, those attending the parties organized there, which have increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, as the angry neighbors said.
The head of the club says that the discomfort was so great that she even agreed to pay the rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, of the Council Alberto Fernández Díaz, claimed last week to immediately evacuate the building in order to resolve coexistence and community spirit caused to neighbors and the destruction of the area.
The popular leader explained that before summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last months the squatters have entered all floors and in most floors and that in some of them there have been burglaries.
In this sense, he added that "impunity is needed and strong resistance to the incivility that has been generated on the farm."
Today, the police evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 the police went to 35 Montral Street after a call from a neighbor who noticed four people had entered the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the potential of the call beyond disputes over fees.
The municipal contest on 16 doors opened the debate on Collserola in Barcelona.
In mid 1980s at the height of the now extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (MCB), this Administration printed promotional leaflets of Collserola.
The booklet defines the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a figure comparison with the New York Central Park.
The park was again placed in the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented north-south but up (mountain)-down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park does not contradict this idea.
The reference was not Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boar in the role of Yogi Bear.
This was all about until, in September, the council called for a mega competition composed of 16 competitions for as many other doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the park, no doubt.
either that or someone wants to build gates to the field.
Collserola is a park or mountain?
The competition, both for its organizational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurrent theme to use when two members of this ancient line of elected persons meet in an elevator.
This fact is a key evidence for the few similarities between three Barcelona architects and the academics, which have been presented.
Miguel Rolo, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
Roland, after reaching the coastline, becomes "necessary" to discuss "the mountain front" whenever Ildefons Cerda's speech, that of green apples has not been carried out.
The most important park in Barcelona is the beach.
Other reasons include its greatccessibility.
The complexity of Collserola is more complex, says the architect, who believes that they are not a park access but as a mapping of some areas where we must act.
Modolo, as Roland and Bayona with experience in the urban world, called the proposal an intellectual challenge with some dangers.
Hazardous situations arising from the "uncertainty of projecting public space" after the experience of the 80's which had in Forum area "his swan song."
First fear is the own delimiting of the borders where to build.
"Limiting something is setting up the next step," meaning, overcoming.
"We must think of new urban planning tools, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can lead to real disaster."
The more tighter question, Modolo believes that the Collserola Valley side can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not by a pure topographical issue.
Modolo remembers that there is already work done by the Board of Collserola that should not fall on deaf ears, but he is grateful for the opportunity to participate in this project from the very beginning.
Then, he understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but he doubts that this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he points to).
According to Bayona, the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the rules do not allow a global view of Collserola: "16 cross courses have been called sea-mountain sense, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This leads, at least in this case, to have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate.
In your opinion, the council should ensure that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety, equipment to facilitate smooth transition between the city and the green.
Jonas Larrazabal will be free.
After 72 days of arrangements, the legal representative of the Red Casino told the brother of the Monterrey mayor of the case for alleged extortion.
After spending 72 days in jail, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be free after the legal representative of the Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court District, followed by a blackmail investigation against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia made public a series of photographs and videos where allegedly Manuel Jonas paid him an economic fee to allow the clandestine operation of the casino.
After public condemnation, the State General Attorney opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2nd he was arrested and held for 30 days.
After four hours the Public Health Ministry for Heritage Crime Agent was transferred to the Temporary Jail, located in the Old Neighborhood of the state capital.
This place he remained for 49 days after the second restriction order after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th he was transferred to Cadereyta allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Red Casino, but he stayed there for only a few hours in medium-security prison because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allow him to continue the trial in the municipal cell boarding San Nicolas of Garza.
Then on October 25th he was arrested by the clerk of Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was enough evidence to establish the guilt of Jonas, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the bookmaker.
The legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek pardon for the regional mayor's brother, so that in the coming hours he may regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the public prosecutor Ramiro Arias questioned Garcia Gomez whether he repaired the damage and which of the betting house partners granted pardon, although the lawyer tried to keep the name.
Based on the record 197/2011 legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazabal and thereafter no claim about the process that was intended against him; also no damage repair or punishment will be required.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmarkers, at around 15:50 it was order to release Larrazabal Breton.
The clerk of the court, Jorge Yanez, went to the jail of San Nicolas of Garza to inform Jonah that he has been legally pardoned and his record will be filed.
Also he will notify him about the immediate release order issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome gives details of the crash where the Interior Minister, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (MCT) reported that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot attempting to force landing.
The pilot took off the aircraft after the flight found that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
The elements that seem to suggest that the unit had several contacts with the ground are the blades that went into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost its fuselage.
The unit was designed for 19 people, so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people.
The investigations in the impact area do not report appearance of pieces on the ground.
In a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact is presented in a structural way.
The design of the helicopter, designed for 19 passengers, fulfilled the appropriate requirements for transporting passengers.
The land has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The secretary of State has called for immediate results, but the investigation may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, general Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that the Presidential helicopter was operating in cruising speed and that this occurred in a soft ascending land.
This information reinforces the hypothesis of normal cruise operation at the time of the impact.
The owner of SCT, Perez Jacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather Conditions:
AICM reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Select route:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched for a lower elevation and better visibility into the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and last record of the aircraft radar match, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in flight direction.
Mixed waste on a small area:
The information available to date suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line.
The dispersion of the wreckage suggests that the helicopter hit the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There was no evidence of fire or explosion:
On the area of the accident there is unclear evidence of a explosion or fire.
Recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
The aircraft was found at an altitude of 9.200 feet above mean sea level, the ground is sloped from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey.
The information provides elements that seem to suggest that the helicopter may have multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area, near the place the accident occurred, no pieces of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity.
MSS announces a protocol for obesity gene identification
Social Security directs a research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called the protocol of 'Genetics of obesity in children and young people', which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the Head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of Specialty Hospital, XXI Century National Medical Center, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that the research unit was integrated with a multi-disciplinary team of doctors, nurses and social workers.
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The research invites the population entitled or not to participate by going to the participant sport units of the MSSI in the Valley of Mexico, where children will be tested every Saturday from 8:00 o'clock.
The protocol started in Cuauhtémoc sports unit (West Mexico State) and since October 8th the activity is held in the Netzahualcoyotl Sport Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Independence Sport Unit (South the Mexico City) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (North the Mexico City).
The purpose of this research is to understand the components and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans the risk factors for the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
The World Diabetes Day is celebrated on November 14 and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years with consent and parental supervision for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family hereditary disease, in order to prevent risk factors that may cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
The anthropometric measures (weight, height, and waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, and determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (seeking to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children.
Epidemiological Health Surveys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys, 77 percent were obese, and 47 percent in the case of girls; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise, according to the specialist of the MSSI.
The reason for searching for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from other populations in its genetic history.
The Mexican population has a 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
The genetics of obesity are generally genetic, and they result in inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume (calories) and which is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
The presence of dark, dark-colored folds (acanthuses) on neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of developing metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled with confidentiality, and doctors send it in writing to the parents, whom they explain each measure and lifestyle change that must be undertaken to prevent disease.
According to Cruz Lopez, there are three major components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day and watching TV, and using transport instead of walking short distances.
Also it is due to high caloric intake, meaning, and increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrate (tamales, bread, pizza, etc) with high fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance, regardless of the environment and temperature.
If the signal is followed, it would require about 200 thousand potholes every rain season in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico, according to Rafael Herrera Najera, a research fellow at the Chemistry Faculty (CF) of the UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is adequate, potholes could be reduced or even eliminated.
In his lecture A technological view of pothole, issued under the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to asphalt but with better mechanical strength both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north, to improve its performance and thus reduce the formation of potholes.
The asphalt, the heavier oil part is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and other of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the road surface its viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is based on the fact that at high temperatures near 180 degrees it acts like a liquid at 120° C, its viscosity is high and at 50 degrees Celsius is nearly solid, while at low temperatures it becomes fragile.
This means that the street asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, said the chemical engineer.
CF researcher observed that the city streets are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of material, of which the last three are asphalt.
The most superficial layer is the asphalt, composed of small stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted.
The stones that form this cover, he added, are dipped with asphalt.
When driving vehicles and generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
Then, he added, is placed a final layer called rolling covering, which is made of fine stone material, meaning sand is also dipped into the asphalt.
This is the layer that will be in contact with the wheel of the vehicle, and it must have better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction.
As the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the effort, the rolling cover also requires proper thickness and material to be considered.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature variations are also important factors to consider, especially water, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt.
When the ground is wet, water diffuses inside the cover and is hard to get out, causing softening of all layers of the pavement and thus causing potholes.
In the formation of a pothole, he says, the first to wear is the rolling cover and only after that affects the asphalt.
Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be always adjusted to the vehicle load and ensure this fulfillment.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already available and even help repair potholes with ease and without high temperatures.
What did Valley candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that affected Serna Melina Ramirez for not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley gets its number 14 of princess.
Once again Cauca Valley remains with the desire to be the Miss Colombia.
The next time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
The result of last night’s crown and scepter, the department has 14 Princess titles, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Monica Evers (1989), Olga Maria Arenas (1983), Monica Evers (1989), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question many people are asking is:
What was missing? Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in every performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain she was elected Queen of Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, titles that were earned by queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question.
To the questioner she answered.
The book that shaped my childhood is The little Prince.
Today I read "Crime and Punishment' it is a universal literature book that we all should read; and now I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The heat of blood.'
A response that the jury did not like due to the term "culturalization' and secondly for not specifically explaining how each of the cited books have marked her.
After the ceremony Melina was calm and happy, "the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen."
The Little Prince is a great book.
The latest theory is that Valley was burned by favoritism.
The reporter from Bogota reported that for being the most preferred, the most acknowledged, and the candidate who received all preliminary awards (Oster food challenge, the public vote for the best traditional costume, and Mother Queen) she failed to perform on stage.
The first appearance in swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although in both she looked confident, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlantic representatives showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program Like home', of RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was designated as princess means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen.
In addition, Valley recently avoided talking to the press, and that was wrong.
The other hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
The reason is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to social needs of her country.
'Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness, before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects'.
The jury chose Valley as the natural beauty with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognises that Melina had the best body, but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which for me was not very noticeable, made her lose points the last day.
While the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that Cauca Valley was the error of the Valley of Cauca.
"The surgery is fine, but Valley did not know how to do them.
The body was never her strongest advantage and here she was punished.
The award, which is for the first time given by the National Beauty Contest, was given after the bikini parade a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night.
Reality or not, Melina today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, found difficulties in getting the crown.
Such was the work of the person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The Cali lophoscopist entered history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4 the Cali CTI lophoscopist becomes a historical figure as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC top leader, "Alfonso Cano" through comparing his fingerprints.
The seven SOPs working in CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability' for Eleazar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tejada, who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
In his career, Gonzalez worked in various municipalities of Chocó, where he often took more than five days to get to the place where the bodies were identified.
In 2000 he moved to the Valley and after taking the corresponding courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of skin friction, which includes the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of Eliazar's operation against alias Alfonso Cano he was warned to wear only three days.
Something big was coming.
On Friday night he went from Cauca with helicopter, to Palmira.
The suspected dead was a man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he took the ten print card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was, he did not recognise him by his physical appearance; it was very different from that seen in the media.
The man was without beard, dressed as a farmer of the area, without glasses and much lighter.
But prints do not lie.
Then, accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a paddle and flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the dead with those of the card.
The eye did not fail him: "Alfonso Cano'.
The same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the top leader of the FARC.
Search for the finger
For a fingerprint specialist from Sijin of Cali the recognition made by the President Juan Manuel Santos to Eleazar Gonzalez in the press conference for the operation against "Cano' is very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Fingerprinting science is an exact science, without error, which can be key solution in crime fighting.
In addition to identifying bodies, fingerprinting specialists support research for crimes like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured.
When captured, many criminals have fake cards or no paper.
We will take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher explained that in a case of theft, he had to remove a wall piece of a house because there the thief supported his hand to take a safe with jewellery and money.
The wall is difficult to get a print of the whole hand and identify the offender, who participated in several robberies.
The prints also rule out or confirm suspects in murder cases.
The investigation has recently found a dead man, with liquor bottles around him.
The investigation revealed that a relative was suspected of the crime and indeed the print on the bottle matched.
Although this is not guaranteed that it was the murderer, it places him in the scene.
A fingerprint expert of CTI explained that in objects "footprints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear there is a paddle or tape to lift them.
After that the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," says CTI expert.
The conclusion was that not everything is as shown in CSI television program.
As not everything that glitters is gold, not everything you touch becomes a footprint.
However, if it can be used, the comparison is made.
The "angry persons" challenge the authorities in New York
The crowds were gathering around Zuccotti square to camp.
The protesters listened to the order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York on Tuesday when they try to enter again under the protection of a court order, in Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn to take control of another park in the Big Apple.
The crowds gathered around Zuccotti square, where they wanted to get in thanks to a court order allowing "angry persons" to camp on the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking a park north of the city where more arrests have been made.
Occupy Wall Street is a political movement that believes in going back to Zuccotti square and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations.
According to Bray, the response of the "angry people" to the evacuation of the camp was taken to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "angry persons" took up a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
The protesters remained in the place for about one hour, but the police came and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the exact number, while telling Efe that they saw several journalists handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police.
The street, which is a privately owned site, remains closed waiting for a court hearing on Tuesday to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
The protesters moved there were carrying and distributing copies of the court order and even gave them to officers guarding the place, which led to "some small confrontations," said Bray.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupy Wall Street and enforce "laws that were issued after the occupation or to prohibit workers regain access to the park with shops and other property used before."
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that, because of that court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and protesters were informed that local laws do not allow them to re-install with camping shops and sleeping bags.
The councilman personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti square carried out at dawn, an operation involving about 200 arrests and this was decided because protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg said the order to evacuate the square was a place where people do not come to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to do harm to others.
The evacuation of this morning shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers than in preserving the financial interests of American workers.
The responsible of "Occupy Wall Street" also announced that they plan to organize "great deeds" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, in order to celebrate the last two months of protests, which started on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will be Virgin Mary in a special TV show.
Together with Michael Buble and other Canadians, she will be featured on the television program It's a Russell Peters Christmas.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement" lifeguard in "Baywatch" Bunny in "Playboy" and now she is the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show at the Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will participate in the television program It's a Russell Peters Christmas.
CTV presented today images of the television show in which Anderson, also known as the Virgin Mary, holding in a crib a doll depicting Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special show features the Canadian singer Buble, who married in Argentina with the Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato, and he is not a stranger to the controversy.
The American Kim Kardashian was called "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption, ending the downturn that started in March.
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake, resulting in a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe in Japan since the Second World War.
The first estimates of material losses in Tokyo government were $ 300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have dimmed.
After three consecutive quarters of decline, the GDP data between July and September helped to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese the Fiscal Year begins in March 2012 - represents the fastest rhythm of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the purchase of equipment to repair areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% versus 0.5% decline in capital expenditures which occurred from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not limited to Keynesian impulse that invites taking advantage of the crisis to strengthen-or rebuild-infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, especially thanks to the evolution of household consumption, which now represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase in expenditure for cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
When the yen-the Nippon currency has become a refugee value for investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the US, it has become a privilege for export companies to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the US, a privilege that has a huge impact on export companies.
With stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious blow for a country with a technological line defined by large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed the yen for their poor results in July and September.
As markets continue to invade the peripheral countries of the EU, Yoshihiko Noda’s Government does not lower the guard.
Vigilance is essential to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and rapid appreciation of the yen, said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that predicts the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing.
Since it has fallen four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the average, which is at 100, by rushing eight tenths up to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds back the doubts
Papademos said that changes will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment.
With peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty reinstated in the park, Greece is still entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the Great European Debt Crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new transitional government of Hellene is more based on the demands of Brussels than on a genuine conviction of political forces started to become confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papademos, warned yesterday that no alternative to structural reforms is available and that the one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be underestimated for implementing them, the leader of the New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, reiterated his desire for new elections on February 19th.
The main task of this Government is implementing the decisions of the October 26th summit, which will conclude tomorrow with a confidence vote to the new Executive.
The package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the civil service disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not clear the doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we are not committed to anything."
The Conservative leader took a step further to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needed, and stressed that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the changes.
The European Commission, still nappy rash by the impact of the all or nothing statement of Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that it will not unlock the help if the new Government and the major Hellene parties do not sign a written commitment without ambiguity and this as soon as possible.
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, said the troika inspectors will return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what has to be done to pay the sixth tranche of 8,000 million", but no specific date is given.
The Greek hank still has a thread for the moment.
Sofia: "They are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "dominant place in Spain in relation to this type of finance.
Spain has achieved a prominent position worldwide in Microfinance role.
Yesterday, the country has become the second donor in the cooperation instrument, which is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humans, based on trust in human beings."
The Queen opened yesterday the fifth Global Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the belief that such operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Goals, especially having as a goal halving the volume of people living with less than a dollar per day, and this would establish the "poverty line."
Spanish leadership is still working to expand the network of beneficiaries worldwide, and takes the task with responsibility.
There are many achievements and many challenges we are going through.
Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also as a platform that promotes two basic goals.
The Queen explained that at the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of poverty.
The initiative for micro credits in Spain and worldwide has followed the path started years ago by Muhammad Yunus, which featured Mrs. Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition."
The Queen referred to the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist of the universal fight against poverty," whose work has been known for 15 years, when she went to Bangladesh to investigate the policy of loans.
The experience followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have seen the continuing evolution of the project," said The Holy Mother, whose link with this project led her to the title of "head of the family" in Valladolid from the "banker of the poor."
Finally, the Queen advised all present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
Ethics imperative
Trinidad Jiménez, Foreign Minister, said solidarity is an ethical imperative in every democratic state.
In this regard, she added that it is a "continuing obligation" to cooperate with developing countries in times of economic boom, as it is a continuing obligation.
Jimenez found that microcredit requires "serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradication of poverty," and now more than ever, developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not allow this to fall into adjustment.
Microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
The Minister for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the success of giving trust to people "excluded from all doors" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors with a spirit of solidarity."
CDU is planning to elect the European President by universal suffrage.
The first day of the CDU Congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig was without any real problems for the Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the President of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned to be on the programme, but it took place in the fall, mainly to satisfy the militants who will be watching the government's policy on Greece today and maybe that on Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's chairmanship motion, tabled by the Directorate, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abdicated from voting.
The standing ovation that they, Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the European Minister of Finance, received at the end of their respective speeches, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and of the motion is based on the slogan "the right response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the Euro."
The Chancellor says, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe ."
This could mean modifications of the Lisbon Treaty, allowing European Union to strengthen the control of the budgetary policy of the Eurozone countries, but this could also affect the election of the European Commission by universal suffrage to impart a face to Europe.
This is generally the case of one of the proposals of the congress that has clear inspiration from Wolfgang Schäuble.
The Twenty-Seven are not probably to rapidly agree to this solution, as the heads of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it.
But the marker is still in place.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each Member of the European Central Bank Directorate according to the size of its economy, which clearly would increase the weight of Germany.
The Chancellor wanted to calm the party climate, but she did not seek to influence the Congress on the back of the "small European countries" or of those in difficult situations, who are quick to criticize Germany.
Although the European motion includes a paragraph on "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except when in a hole.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the scene of bloody battle.
In fact it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is sick leave fraud ?
After allowances, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject, which has been recurring since 2007, on social assistance fraud.
The majority of the Republicans want to support this offensive which is based on a desire to make economies in the context of constraints, but also forms part of the presidential re-election campaign.
First and first, with regard to budgetary economies, the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of the unemployment benefit.
Without specific consent of the employer, an employee falls sick will lose four days' pay equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to raise a rash but which, according to The Echos, would save 280 million Euros.
The measure would be accompanied by another more symbolic measure, namely the obligation on public employees of one day's wait for benefit payment in case of sick leave (public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit as against three days' wait by private employees).
The majority of these questions are being discussed, the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud, targeting abuse of medical certificates.
Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday 13 November.
Other cases, the effects of the announcement seem to be little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificate-related fraud.
This has been monitored constantly since 2002 via political offensives, which usually produce fruit.
French are no slower than other Europeans.
First, look at the national figures.
The National Insurance Agency for Disease Prevention and Control (NAIDS) paid over 237 million Euros in 2006.
The daily compensation expenditure in 2008 at 11,3 million Euros, was 5% of total health expenditure.
The total amount of this sum was 46% related to maternity leave and work accidents and 54% sick leave benefit at 6,2 million Euros.
It represented 2,5% of health-related expenditure.
The French average sick leave spent in 2010 was 14,5 days compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
An average, which does not hide some differences; another inquiry published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French employees who were questioned had no sick days.
Another study, this time on sick leave, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 15% from one to three months and 11% lasted longer.
According to these figures, French employees are no more likely to take sick leave than those in any other country.
The long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of work absence from work in France (for health or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with between 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK, or between 16% and 18% in The Netherlands.
Sickness certificate-related fraud is very low compared with "black" labour.
As regards fraud, it is very low.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic control of certificates valid for longer than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1,5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285 000 controls on short-term sick certificates were "unjustified," or too long, equal to 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled certificates for more than 45 days, 11% of cases were found to be "inappropriate or unjustified" out of 1,2 million, equal to 132 000.
In total, 169 000 cases were "unjustified" out of several million employees given certificates.
A figure representing very few cases, compared to the "black" labour figure.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the subject in June, this would represent 9 to 15 million Euros annual tax shortfall, equal to more than the total cost of daily compensation and therefore infinitely higher than fraud.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy.
This was declared on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in parliament, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition government were not enough to achieve this task.
The effort to rescue the economy requires the support of European partners and a new budgetary programme.
The implementation of the decisions at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the Eurozone is at stake.
Accordingly, M. Papademos forecast that the country's public deficit would be reduced to "about 9%" of the PIB by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the Right, gave his support to already approved measures to try to emerge from the debt crisis, but warned that he would not support additional austerity.
They will not vote in favour of new measures, he told the deputies of his New Democracy party.
The declaration of his agreement with the objectives of reducing the deficit and the debt and the fight against waste was acknowledged.
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs warned that the FMI and the EU would not unblock the 8 million million Euros needed to support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign any under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts.
Canadians are half dead, according to a report from the Royal Society of Canada.
Regarding palliative medicine, the Committee claims that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care, apart from cancer cases.
Canadian society is half dead.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to speak with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end.
This is one of six conclusions of an enormous report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included ethics, law and medicine.
This Committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such decision.
The experts cite recent investigation by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared death quality in 40 countries worldwide.
The study reports that "the medicalisation of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to tackle death.
Medicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
86% of them die in hospital.
Countrywide, it is in Quebec that the rate is highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospital.
The report reaches conclusions that contradict the position of the Federal government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
The experts also review the position of all countries where such activities have been legalised or decriminalised, and no evidence is available that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application, i.e. eutanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are not competent or consenting.
The contrary, according to Jocelyn Downie, who submitted the report, more such cases were found in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favour of euthanasia, because according to an Angus Reid investigation in 2010, they believe that it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
The legalisation of euthanasia would not send a message that the life of elderly or handicapped persons was less value.
Regarding persons who commit assisted suicide, investigations indicate that 41% of such cases should not have been prosecuted.
Regarding the continuation or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient, the situation is less clear, says the report.
They also suggest that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal.
The Expert Committee also asks that health professionals should be trained in the duty to maintain nursing care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
Regarding palliative care, the Committee calls on governments, nursing institutions, and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cancer cases.
However, concerning palliative sedation already widely used in Canada, the Committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain, as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
The Royal Society of Canada experts have already voiced reservations about the conclusions of the report.
Maître Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health legislation, called it "extreme" because the report does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to terminal cases.
The report opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide, says Me Deschamps.
Me Deschamps says that the authors of the report appear to place the person’s independence above all other values that contribute to the fabric of society.
The society has signposts and constraints.
The specialist in health law, Margaret Somerville also expressed strong opposition to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "obviously pro-euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, challenges the data of the report on abuses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised, such as Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on Assad to relinquish power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming more isolated.
The opposition to Bachar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on the Syrian President Bachar al-Assad, who, with Russia, is resisting them and has denounced a "plot" against his country.
The European Union has renewed its sanctions against Damascus, while Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan, supported the departure of President Assad.
Yesterday, King Abdallah II of Jordan became the first Arab leader to call for the resignation of the Assad president in Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the army of the regime were killed.
If Bachar had the interest of his country, he would have to resign but he would also have to create the conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the creation of the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the creation of the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the creation of the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the creation of the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the creation of the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would require the creation of the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, which would be created by the King of Jordan.
In his reply, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, called for failure in Turkish mediation efforts, which started in the start of the year.
They are at peace with their people but cannot fulfil their aspirations, he added, referring to Syria, a neighboring country, on which Turkey is adopting a more harsh line.
The United States is congratulating the increase in consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime after the decisions of the Arab League and European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab Legaue, and countries such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harder line in the face of the repression in Syria, according to Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 military troops die in the area of Deraa in the south of Syria, according to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians died in exchanges of fire and heavy weapons at Jobar in the swollen city of Homs, according to his NGO.
During a Press Conference, the Syrian foreign minister Walid Mouallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.
The latter also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus, which he believes is a "dangerous step."
Syria will not bend, he added, assuring that Syria will not bend.
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a civil protection mechanism and needs the dispatch of 500 members of Arab rights organisations, media and military observers into the country.
The French foreign minister Alain Juppé also declared his support for the dispatch of UNO observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he called "paranoid."
New extraordinary meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow to discuss the implementation of the escape from the crisis decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from the disputes towns and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday described the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect", while China advised Syria to implement the plan of emerging from the crisis, taking care not to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a programme that will require "sacrifices" to recover credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was yesterday in discussions with the political parties before today's meeting with unions and employers.
The cabinet will have to form a moderate cabinet, with technocrats from outside the parliament.
Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting the new Prime Minister-designate.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he would wait to hear if Mario Monti would ask parliament for a confidence vote between now and Friday to assess whether the new government had enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a limited list of dozens or so ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Ms Monti commented on the nervousness of the stockmarkets here, asking them for time.
In democracy, time is needed for the preparedness of a government and a programme, he stressed, adding that the markets would be patient and understanding.
The appointment of the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but disquiet appeared, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in Eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate had to form a team, most importantly comprising technocrats, but he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians."
The new government would last until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
The President of the Deputy Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, says the new government would secure the vote of confidence of the parliament by Friday.
M. Monti took the promise that after his appointment he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again be a European player.
The European Commission spokesman, Olli Rehn, stressed that "regardless of the new government, our diagnostic of Italy has not changed."
The European Union, being convinced that Rome would not achieve its objective budget in 2013 despite the recent austerity plan, has asked for stringent new measures.
The Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet him on Tuesday, has also stressed the need for relaunching the economy, "because a country without growth cannot observe the parameters of deficit."
M. Monti, known for his competence and for independence when he was European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "leap of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism," the "professor" representing "seriousness and another Italy," according to the leaders.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
However, Napolitano would like to avoid an early election, because by April 2012 Italy must place State debentures worth 200 million Euros.
Russian scientist has assisted in Iran nuclear programme
The Russian scientist Vycheslav Danilenko assisted Iran in the development of a detonator compatible with a nuclear weapon, according to an American agency specialising in atomic hazard.
The Institute of International Safety ISIS) is based on the recent report from the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents from this UNO agency to identify this researcher.
The AIEA announced its serious disquiet about a possible military dimension of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS based on AIEA documents, M. Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for 30 years from the sixties on in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tchelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the manufacture of synthesized diamond.
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to start a company producing nano-diamonds in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iran embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Then he worked on Iran programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its last report, AIEA mentions strong indications that the development of a nuclear detonation system by Iran was aided by a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique, but who also informed the Agency that he worked for most of his career on this technology in the military nuclear programme of his country of origin.
Anti-Moslem crimes have increased by 50% in the past year.
In 2009 and 2010, anti-Moslem crimes increase by nearly 50%, while other forms of racial and religious violence had fallen a little or no change, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Moslems moved from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, equal to a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in attacks on Catholics, a drop of 4% of attacks on Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes.
The global number of hate crimes increased very little to 6 628 cases, of which 47,3% were caused by racial differences and 20% by religion, according to FBI.
Human Rights First says after a decrease in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes increasing again, added the organisation.
Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Moslems, as well as all forms of hate crime must be considered serious human rights violations.
The American government can and must do more to deal with his abuse, he says, suspecting that this may be due to the editing of police reports on hate crimes.
"Hate crime" in Federal law is a legacy from the period of civil rights fighting.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, colour of skin, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks like Facebook
The microblog site Twitter introduced changes in its presentation, allowing users to monitor the activity of those they monitor, which makes it similar to Facebook.
New tab "activity" and another "name" allow you to follow more securely and directly the activity of other "Twitters," the internet navigators whose messages are monitored ("tweets") and of those who monitor you.
This enables one to know if they send messages to be monitored, if they subscribe new accounts, if they have favourite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested on a small percentage of users in August before being broadcast to the network on Monday.
While Twitter has been known for being rather unintuitive, and for its use of somewhat esoteric terms (RT for reposting someone else's message, #followfriday for recommending other users to follow other users), it is now opening itself to a wider audience by providing a user experience closer to that of popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users discussed this innovation via "tweets" on the Internet.
It is useless, invasive and excessively resembles Facebook.
"The function activity will help me monitor better certain elements of my Twitter flow," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Inscription of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The Austrian government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce public deficits and thus prevent possible downgrading of Austria's sovereign credit rating (triple A).
The social democratic Chancellor of his elf, Werner Faymann, announced this decision at the end of a meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austrian public debt at 74,6%, much above the norm of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
Without Austria's solvency having not fallen by one notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three thousand million Euros more every year, according to the vice-chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus complies with a request from the Brussels summit of Eurozone on 26 October, where the Heads of State and Government requested a reduction of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to achieve the same effect.
The Austrian government's dispositions approach the "German model" and are the first European country to adopt this "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit must fall by 0.75% of the PIB) and from 2017, the structural public deficit of Austrian Federal State must not exceed 0.35% of the PIB in any year, while the Länder, as well as communities must submit balanced budgets.
The goal is to make public debt fall below the 60% criterion fixed by the Treaty of Maastricht by 2020/2021.
Noda Hiroshi
threatens fresh intervention on the exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, threatened to intervene in the exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We would intervene as we did last year if we found excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Noda to the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen rose to near historical levels, causing the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
The year after that, Tokyo sold the yen against the dollar on a mass scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which was breaking new records since 1945.
The yen has steadily risen since then, driven by purchases by investors who consider it as a "shelter" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen and the Euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last intervention.
The dollar was about 120 yen and the Euro was about 160 yen.
This rise of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports, because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of Japanese firms from abroad, when converted into the national currency.
"Japan is fighting to reconstruct itself" since the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the north-eastern region of Tohoku (north-east).
The world's third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter - 1% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rise in exports and consumption of affected households.
The Prime Minister believed that the high yen price reflected "Japan's economic fundamentals ."
The finance minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to take every necessary step to weaken the yen.
The deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warning that the Bank of Japan had already taken the appropriate steps, warning that no additional monetary flexibility was expected on Wednesday.
Since its last meeting in October, the issuing institution increased by 5.000 million yen (47 thousand million Euros) in treasury bond purchases, raising the ceiling to 55.000 million yen (519 million Euros).
Eurozone:
The rates are rising, the stock exchanges are wavering.
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is increasing in European indices.
Although new government heads are appointed in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise.
Fearing for Eurozone stability, European exchanges have entered a negative area on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m. the CAC 40 lost 1,3% to end at 3.064 points.
Frankfurt fell 0,4% and London 0,1%.
With new tensions about the yield of loans from Eurozone States in difficulty, the global share markets may lose some of their recent gains.
Fearless investors are only too aware of the risk of contagion, explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo exchange closed with a drop of 0.7%, raising new doubts among market participants on the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
”Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe and the exchanges will chase each other in a narrow corridors as investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilised,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-emerging concern about the future of Eurozone has further damaged the single currency, which has continued to fall on Tuesday.
The Euro is reaching its lowest level for a month and half.
The European currency is now worth 1,3570 dollars, having fallen by 0,4%.
According to brokers, it took place after the CDU meeting on Monday adopted a motion, which includes the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the Eurozone without also leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates substantially above 6%.
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very disquieting levels.
This Tuesday morning the yield of Italian 10-year debentures reached 6,85%, while Spanish ones reached 6,2%.
This tensions of interest rates of southern countries, but also France continue to feed the apprehensions of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti asked the markets for time to re-establish the situation in an Italy threatened by asphyxia by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos affirmed that the implementation of the decisions at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the line of fire by the markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The spread of the rate between 10-year German and Spanish bonds has reached a new historical high level.
Awaiting the Eurozone growth figures
France has recorded a GDP growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0,3%, due to increased household consumption.
The Inseen however revised the figure for the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1% of the gross internal product (PIB) instead of stagnation.
It is really the fourth quarter, which most disquiet the economists.
Germany has registered a growth of 0.5% for the same period.
The first estimate for the whole Eurozone is expected at 11 a.m, the European Commission warning of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Fact must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be tackled via short term considerations or under emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such issues and the place occupied by nuclear power.
The debate will not be fruitful unless it fully explores the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on the objective fact of rational data.
The number of humans on the planet is 7 million, and demographic development will require a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a large proportion of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
During this period, it will be necessary to address the increasing shortage of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgeting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climatic imbalance, a subject that has gone from the ecology debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which requires a source of alternative energy to replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which aims to build only the most modern ones.
The other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil to cite only a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre, which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes quoted as an example, the reality contradicts that argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise in the price of electricity, a higher energy dependence caused by increasing recourse to import gas, mainly from Russia, and a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal centres.
In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion in building turbines, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, is also one of the most important users of coal and gas due to intermittent wind, which causes its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity is 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
The other hand, thanks to the constant energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for their electricity than French households.
In the global economy, energy cost is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
The significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would lead to a huge rise in the cost of electricity, which would render illusory the fine declarations on re-industrialisation of our country and protection of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of the French refuse to pay, especially since they do not object to this form of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that our country provided a industrial line of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 resulting jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a galaxy of specialised RME's in international markets and creates many jobs that cannot be moved elsewhere.
If France decides to abandon nuclear power, she would sacrifice large number of these RME's and lose the annual 6 million million Euros worth of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would recommend an EPR designed to function for six years, if the decline of its manufacture was programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of electricity.
The development of low carbon dioxide emission solutions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary nature of energy.
Nucleus energy to maintain the highest level of safety is absolutely vital.
In France, we have a safety authority, which exercises intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Flamanville.
Our team, recognised for its professionalism, is known for the same safety concern.
In a space of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions but without human or environmental consequences.
At Tchernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error caused the drama.
At Fukushima, some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two unprecedented natural disasters, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident as it has from its two predecessors.
The result of this step and cooperation between safety authorities, the operators and the French and German constructors, the EPR presents a design that can resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre, a decision to construct it at Flamanville would be a huge gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by clearing their way to seize the lead of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and partisan manipulation to dominate the debate, which is so important for our economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy’s immigration policy was criticised from several aspects, including congestion of police, legal and administrative services subjected to a number policy and the compatibility of that policy with the self-proclaiming status of the country as a country of human rights.
More recently, it is administrative harassment of foreign students, with the Interior Minister ("Libération" on 23 May declaring that France "does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waiters."
It is only rarely analysed from the economic perspective.
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject.
The right hand was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers," and on the left by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France "cannot accommodate all the world's misery."
Only difference is the degree of generousity.
In 2005, fear of invasion of national territory by Polish plumbers was felt both on the left and on the right.
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity, which one does afford to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, which says that co-development would solve our immigration problem.
This notion of immigration being a burden and problem may be an electoral asset, but it is economically very costly.
The economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron, remind us in a recent book summarizing the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shapes Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp).
Immigration prevention leads to anaemic growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they may replace native workers, in particular unqualified ones, which could cause downward pressure on wages.
However experience shows that immigrants are much more complementary to, than replace, local labour, in trades where local labour is short of local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
positive effect on wages
In a similar way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, the complementarities between locals and immigrants indicate that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on locals’ pay.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1% in migrant flow causes an increase of between 0,6 and 0,9% in real long-term pay.
The conclusion is not without considering the fact that diversity contributes to ideas and to economic growth (a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among American Nobel laureates, while Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo are all founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget of European countries.
World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant arriving at the age of 30, will make a net contribution (receipts less expenditure) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to look for missing points of growth "with the teeth."
The ticks, which were intended to discourage immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, thinks in terms of European democracy
Democracy is a precious possession; it is also a fragile one.
The European continent should remember that having invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced the World War, totalitarism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to finally triumph over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to do so as directly as possible.
It is known since the time of Napoleon it was a matter of intelligence.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the essential principle of democracy, is not enough and can actually become a tool of oppression, as once called the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No,democracy requires much more, public space, public spirit, values, organisation, a separate and control of powers, education, the Lumieres, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are going through is not an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this sense, the palinode of a true-false Greek referendum will have a double revelatory value, that of a need for a massive policy change but also that of the growing sense of its impossibility and incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought through, in order to bypass it.
The truth is that the line of the front line of democratic struggle has now moved, and for many, the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums organised as required and in a confused sequence.
The "free hand of an absolute European monarch, or a tied foot jump into the national void; what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want the blades of a guillotine, but a joint, serene and continued exercise of choice and democracy, this time on European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them, because there is only one crisis and that is Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which rely on the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies, who suffer from their incapacity and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe, which is humiliated on international scene.
The disquiet is about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the entire Europe, gradually losing its sovereignty, and with its each of its nations.
The urgency is related to return to popular sovereignty, the direction of the European project.
Because it is by all working together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their individual debts, to free themselves from the market and to prepare for the future by investing in it.
Emerging from the crisis will require European level decisions, which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy and without leading to disaster.
After long fights with specialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world now calls for an European economic government.
Let it be.
The idea without stronger economic, political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens would be a fresh folly and new impasse.
We must launch a new stage of European construction.
To establish the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build an European integration on economic level.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on political level, a real European sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
Chip maps without contacts become generalised
The world chip map room will open on Tuesday at Villepinte near Paris in optimistic atmosphere.
The year 2011 should end with an 11% rise in worldwide sales of microprocessors (Bank cards, SIM cards ...), with over 6 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector is contactless technology, which enables passengers to pay for common transport or purchases simply by passing the card over a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will progress in 2012 (580 million units) and represent almost 10% of the global market of chip cards (6,925 million cards).
For a long time, lagging behind Asia Pacific region, Europe is now gaining ground in contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and 75 000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the start is more modest; 400.000 contactless Visa card are in use.
The large stores are installing superfast slots.
This year, Carrefour issued 2,5 million contactless MasterCards.
To achieve higher speeds, it is now necessary to equip their clients.
"Two large French establishments have taken a systematic approach to distributing cards equipped for contactless use, announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile telephone payment
This is only the first stage of the future payment mode, namely the mobile phone.
NFC technology is currently available in some apparatus.
"They have been delayed.
They should really take wing next year.
”We are counting on a global sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
The banks are making their way.
Crédit Agricole announced a test to run from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 clients and collaborators are going to be equipped to authorise contactless payment.
The BPCE has similar projects in Strasbourg and Marseille.
The Société Générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing the launch of a offer allowing its clients to pay via their mobile devices.
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria.
Paris is concerned by links between Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers is now certain.
The way the two organisations work and the reports of secret services show that there is a lot of cooperation, he explained without elaborating.
Paris seems to do similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January found two bridges.
The men who kidnapped men in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqui, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed on the next day along with several of their kidnappers in an operation launched by special French forces.
The remaining rubble left by the action, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of calls indicate several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to RFI, two numbers interest the investigators, one leading to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maiduguri, a town in Northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who is believed to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
This is an advance, but it is probably necessary to wait for more exact evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.
"But it is possible."
It has been known for years that the sect benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is growing more and more active, says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent years, this support has become more and more evident from the developments and statements by Boko Haram and from its operational methods, which increasingly include resorting to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines.
The international community, starting with Washington, is now pressing Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of wise people not worthy of interest.
Rapid success
Established in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and a fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram is a criminal, which promotes the installation of an Islamic emirate in the north of Nigeria.
This poor region is growing rapidly.
It is politicised and demands rigid adherence to sharia, while its militants fight with the impious central government.
The latter target primarily churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants appeared particularly active, multiplying attacks on police establishments.
The reaction of Abuja is as usual, without light and shade.
The army surrounds a town and leaves 800 dead behind.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect will radicalise and leave its northern areas.
Last Christmas it claimed an attack, which left 80 dead in Jos and more in Abuja.
In June at Abuja, Boko Haram takes a secured police QG during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will move from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria, now disquietes all security experts.
Now that Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger and the Somalis of al Chebab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the continent.
The last week in an interview with Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and declared himself ready to share all intelligence.
The world according to the republican presidential candidates
China, Iran, and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and lack of knowledge.
Does America weakened by crisis lead a complex world by simple and indeed simplistic ideas ?
To listen to republican presidential candidates, the electoral body may believe it.
Some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others repeatedly and shortly make foreign policy declarations, which are traditionally a republican strong suit.
China, Iran and Israel, the slogans are often fused together.
Senator Mitt Romney, the best placed for the "Grand Old Party" threatened to drag China before the OMC and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency, a sensitive subject in an America which is stunned by the migration of whole sectors of its industry to Asia.
It would be much worse if this should trigger a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to suppress an attitude that flatters the emotions.
The chairman called for a muscular, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
Huntsman, who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he announced.
If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.
Hr also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfil his obligations towards that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second best placed, says he has no knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for opposition to the Chinese military threat, because Peking is trying to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that China has it since 1964!
The Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Prison torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and by the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from 2008 republican candidate John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current president replies that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water his wine on anti-terrorism.
The experts believe in the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran on the early departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his failure in Libya calling him weak.
It is not so easy.
The population judges Obama's balance of national security, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it rejects military interventions, which result in quicksands.
In arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
North Stream gasduct connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the Baltic Sea has been commissioned.
It is expected to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the giant Russian gas producer, wanted to celebrate the event with a "bang."
The Baltic Sea was a scenic spot for 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, to inaugurate North Stream, the new gasduct that directly links Russia and Germany under the sea.
Together, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russia president Dmitry Medvedev, and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gasduct, 27,5 million million cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking Saint Petersburg to the Mecklenburg-Pomerania region.
The second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012, allowing the delivery of total 55 million cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the total French consumption.
The possibility of constructing a second pipeline of the same course is already under discussion.
Gazprom is proud to ensure the timely completion of this huge project.
The project was fiercely contested by Poland and the Baltic States.
North Stream will in fact allow direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
This two countries will lose some of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets.
The most critical point of the debate was when Warsaw took North Stream new "German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
It is apolitically sensitive topic.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is gaining more security for its supplies.
The cost of depriving Europe of energy is at the price of depriving Europe of energy, since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe.
Russia has successfully achieved in less than five years, in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large quantities of gas and whose deposits are declining.
The gasduct is a new artery that links us organically, which is a new artery that links us organically.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom headquarters, present largely at Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gasduct is also technical.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete, to protect it from ships' anchors.
Ir remains on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 metres.
To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second World War.
The hundred were removed or destroyed as a precaution, says Jens Müller, spokesman of North Stream company.
It was also necessary to multiply the steps of protecting the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal serpent, weight equivalent to 242 Eiffel towers, with no breaks throughout its length, no valves and no maintenance stations.
The control platform was provided on the level of Sweden, but the project manager abandoned it because Sweden was not keen to see a Russian State company become permanently on its shores.
In case of accident we stop the passage of gas for at least one minute.
In case of leak, the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air.
The constructors believe that the welds will only leak every 100 000 years.
The surveillance of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot, pulled by a ship for outside observation, and by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct.
The cigar shape is introduced into the 1-metre wide pipeline, and it is pushed along by the gas.
After 3 complete days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides precise information about any metal deformation.
The gasduct was designed to work for 50 years without even the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is implemented by its pressure.
This is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shareholding.
Others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
This five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream, which is responsible for constructing and running the gasduct.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom next leased to this company for 20renewable years, the entire capacity of gas transport.
Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, whatever may be the quantity of gas transported.
The financing of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30% by the shareholders and of 70% by Bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 million Euros for the two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
The minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs, since Gazprom assumes the entire risk.
The gasduct emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin on a sandy littoral with conifers.
4.5 metre high valves form the gas exit.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and specific gravity of arriving gas before being transported into German gasducts.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic cubic cubic cubic of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine will restore the taste of writing.
It is a scent of adventure, of hours sent in writing by the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easy to recognise, by its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its broken white pages, as if aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a designer notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant of the company, has assumed the responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, mole skin, which is varnished cotton used for covering benches, for example.
This type of notebook is said to be highly prized by writers and travellers.
'Moleskine has been updated to meet current taste for an old and forgotten object, which was an avant-garde artist's icon up to the XXth century', added Maria Sebregondi.
Success is a combination of success.
Within 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 25% to reach 12.7 million units.
One has travelled far from the first years of production, when only 3000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine is crossing the Italian frontier and is exporting to 70 countries, from France to USA.
The typical buyer is difficult to identify, since the notebook attracts equally a businessman, a student and a professional.
Moleskin consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had only 12 employees at the start, now has almost 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries, small shops in town centres and has become well known.
”We follow the spirit of the times and this need for new ways of writing, despite the rise of e-mail,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is a signature of Moleskine, recently launching an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Through the success and cultural aura, Moleskine diversified its products into handbags, pens, computer bags.
The success of the collaboration which aroused envy; in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, to write a new page in the history of Moleskine.
How is the unemployment rate of handicapped workers so high?
Some 19% of handicapped persons are looking for work.
The 15th week for the handicapped work starts today.
The rate of unemployment of the handicapped is still twice as high as the average, namely 19%, versus 9% for the general population.
Discoding?
No, says Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association which organises the week for the employment of the handicapped.
The progress achieved since 15 years ago is considerable.
"At that time the unemployment rate was not 2x but 3x as high."
There is still a huge amount to do.
It must be added that for the handicapped, the obstacles to obtaining work still exist.
Their age is quite young: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
Their qualifications are very low, 80% do not have the "bac" and out of the 2.3 million students in high education only 10 000 are handicapped.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread, with 85% for the handicapped versus 38% on average.
Overall, all these are criteria that significantly complicate employment and which constitute the nub of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit handicapped workers.
Here are some brakes.
It is hard to speak about mentalities, which change but too slowly.
The study conducted in April by the association IMS-Cité Corporate Partnership showed that the managers questioned had low level of knowledge of handicap, with an overrepresentation of persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectually deficient persons.
Results - private companies employing over 20 persons are still far from meeting the objective of employing the 6% of handicapped workers, fixed by a law from 1987.
The last known figures from 2008 have a ratio of 2.6%.
Currently we are around 3% of businesses who do not observe this law.
Proof: The number of "taxed" establishments, as well the paid amounts, have declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million Euros).
The law of 2005, which raised the contributions, has caused strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a rise of consciousness, particularly in large groups."
According to the ministry of employment, only 59% of establishments employing between 20 and 49 persons are employed, compared to 82% of establishments employing between 100 and 199 persons.
What happiness is?
Before taking on the Blues on Tuesday evening (20.45 hrs) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens could not hide the pleasure they have when they faced the Blues.
The image is symbolic.
The two brothers sitting on the tribune of the Stadium of France, shared a peace.
Five months after the funny gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector can only be praised.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go forward, says the Lillois.
In contrast to his respective club and selection performances, "it is of a piece if it is justified."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"I must take my marks."
Selected to play against Romania on Friday evening in its match against France, Hazard went to Saint Denis to last shine.
Not however forgetting the notion of "pleasing."
The Blues encouraged him from the age of 7 years and the victories of 1998 and 2000 were his contribution.
"I always support them, he says.
This essentially participates in strengthening the particular character of this match.
However, opposite are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami).
"We just cross our path."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
With a smile, Leekens called "pride."
"Pride" of playing in a "Gala Match."
"Pride" also in ing ass "neighbour" that France has "become again very high level team" only a little more than one year after the trauma of Knysna.
Laurent Blanc was a thunderbolt, he thunders.
The technician will share an aircraft with the Blues management... Brazil in 2014.
Our little Belgians become big, he stressed.
One is building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"You will see this in the coming matches, including that against France.
Portugal is very confident.
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts its return match against Bosnia (22h00) very optimisticly, this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On their way to the meeting, both teams appeared to have lack of realism.
The end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and most importantly, a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
The confidence is without shadow of doubt that the Selection, with which he has been at odds since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is match to play and a challenge to conquer.
In view of the (0-0), on Friday in the Hell of Zenica it is clear that the games are not over.
The Portuguese dominated the match for over one hour, but they failed to reach this precious target, which would have consoled it.
It is a good result, which however requires a risk.
The Portuguese are very confident that they are playing in front of a huge crowd, even if the match is close.
”We are expecting a close match, but we are confident that we can win,” added the Portuguese trainer aged 42.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," even under the succession of Carlos Queiroz.
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia means the Portuguese to win.
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosnians.
It is a good result, but does not always carry risk, regrets Bento.
They are going to play a team with many technical qualities and players with many individual qualities.
The Portuguese would plan to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the start, to "give them no time to think."
Good idea, if it will prove realistic this time.
