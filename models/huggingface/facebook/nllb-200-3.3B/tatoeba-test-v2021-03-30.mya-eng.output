She is a girl.
We decided that we would have a private wedding.
Get up.
I'm not afraid of Tammy.
Take your hand off my money.
What time is it?
Do you think these glasses will go with me?
How many years have you owned this building?
Tom is our friend.
This is probably your toothbrush.
I was playing golf that morning.
Some of our members did not attend the meeting.
I already have a wedding ring.
They were swimming.
He had lied about where he was that day.
Tom is very talkative.
How many cities have you visited?
Do you have beer?
It's in the bathroom on the other side.
How old is this tie?
I don't like this website.
I am a human being.
I hope I can play as good as I can.
Thank you.
I'd be surprised who won.
I think Mary is more beautiful than Alice.
I need to buy a new toothbrush.
I can't see you tomorrow.
This was the first time that had ever happened.
It's hard to predict what the weather will be like tomorrow.
Love or hate is a very powerful emotion.
I'll be able to play the cello as well.
I couldn't lie to Tom anymore.
I'm curious to see which one you'll win.
The next day, he was playing golf.
I really don't understand the question you asked.
And I was probably still taking French lessons at the time.
Mary also likes bananas.
If you want a job done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself.
"The Bible says that the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be cut off from the path.
I felt the same way.
I'm going shopping with Tom.
What a marvelous sight!
How many seahorses did you see today?
I think you should answer your own question.
He was talking nonsense.
He just wants to see me happy.
How many eggs do you want me to buy?
Tom was a very bad guy.
Tom didn't look where he was going, so he fell down in the dock.
These glasses go with you.
What does that mean?
Love and hate are both external emotions.
I can't see you tomorrow.
Which do you like better, an apple or a banana?
It's where no one else can get it.

The boy who came yesterday was my little brother.
How long has it been since you've been together?
It's not as scary as you think.
I felt the same way.
Stay at home.
The two were married in a private ceremony in the city of Toronto.
A lot of the highway is still closed.
The Khalifa Tower is now the world's tallest skyscraper.
Some in the crowd were waving flags.
Tom didn't look where he was going, so he fell off the bridge.
I'm going to have to buy a new toothbrush.
My wife.
The clouds have cleared.
I decided to stay quiet until Mary returned home.
Tom is married to a Canadian woman named Mary.
Could you bring me a glass of water?
Mary is my aunt.
This kind of thing happens because you don't care about yourself.
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
What do you want from me?
I know you have it.
How many hippo did you meet today?
It's not easy to make women happy.
I'm pretty sure that was a mistake.
I knew that the box was empty.
I can't see you tomorrow.
It's better than just feeding the cow.
Do you think these glasses will go with me?
He looks rich now.
She was swimming.
What an incredible sight.
I think that's your toothbrush.
I wanted to learn how to get food in France.
You're not taking care of yourself.
Just a second.
Tom rarely is late for an appointment.
I'm learning Braille.
I looked at my watch and realized I was an hour early.
Tom swims in the water.
Are you always the same?
Let's see if there's any cold beer.
I think that toothbrush is yours.
We're still investigating this.
This was the first time this ever happened.
I'm sorry I forgot to call you.
I did.
When will the roses in your garden bloom?
The Bible says that "they will not be made to see the light of day".

I asked Tom to do that.
Which way is best?
I think we've been caught.
I don't drink that much.
Do you always hike with Tom?
Tom and I spoke French to each other.
Some of our members did not attend the meeting.
I love learning how to get food in France.
I didn't speak French very well when I first met him.
"You didn't think I'd let you do that, did you?"
Is that your toothbrush?
We're out of beer, aren't we?
Doing a Good Thing Daily
And they did.
I wanted to play the piano well.
And I want to be as good as I can be.
I need a big envelope.
I already have a wedding ring.
I don't deny that it's very difficult.
And I'm pretty sure that was a mistake.
You're only getting this because you didn't pay attention.
I found this girl.
What do you want from me?
Twitter has been used in many countries.
I don't like this website.
Come on in
The bus will leave soon.
I can't see you tomorrow.
Twitter is not the type of person to do that.

I like bananas.
When will the roses in your garden bloom?
It is essential.

Island after island
Tom falls into the water.
Tom tricks his friends.
That wasn't the real plan.
Tell me as much as you know about it.
I think Mary is more beautiful than Alice.
The male is a big-footed tiger.
I can't find my toothbrush.
I think we've gotten used to it.
Tom is married to a Canadian woman named Mary.
I hope you're enjoying this holiday season.
I think Mary is more beautiful than Alice.
I'm busy with my homework.
Hello. How are you?
I'm the son of a bitch.
Your room is at the end of the room.
It was a horror movie.
What time is it now?
Tom seemed very worried.
"Where did you leave your trousers?" "I left them at school".
I'm sorry that I forgot to call you.
It's not too late to turn back.
Is it cold outside?
I wanted to see myself laughing.
Tom was very unhappy.
I'm looking for someone to play chess with.
I felt the same way.
I think Tom should stay home with Mary.
Tom likes to fool his friends.
I come in for coffee.
I'm up there.
I'm up there.
I want to see you happy.
I have only one thing to say to those who hate me, and that is your business.
I want to learn to play the piano well.
I'm only five minutes late.
Tom is playing outside with his friends.
I wanted to see Tom's smile.
That movie was scary.
It's not too late to turn back.
It's better than feeding bread to a wild animal, anyway.
I'd be surprised if beer was cold now.
You're asking yourself the question again.
I had my first beer when I was about 13 years old.
I'm up there.
I am married to a Canadian woman named Mary.

Tom knows everyone on his path.
Twitter wanted their kiss to last forever.
I started drinking beer for the first time when I was 13.
What do you want from me?
I mean, we're all in the same boat.
I'm resting on my car.
You are the one who is responsible for all this.
"Are you two cool?"
Tom is very protective of his daughters.
The monkeys like bananas.
I'm sorry that I forgot to call you.
