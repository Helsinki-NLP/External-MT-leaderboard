Rapid increase in cases of COVID-19 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends between EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK which ensures that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly across all countries, despite being at different stages depending on the country.
Based on the knowledge available from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to increase the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of a vaginal pneumonia related to an unknown diagnostic theory was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as an active ingredient is now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was renamed Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The most recent data is that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild pneumonia, or respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
Among 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while 6% of cases suffer from serious illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this survey, we are reviewing the trends of COVID-19 accumulation in each EU/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and comparing them with Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the current number of cases in Italy between 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's post-COVID-19 spread more geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic are currently being followed in the rest of the world.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In the EuroSurveillance 2020 issue of 5 March, Spiteri and his partners reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China were reported by France on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK) had COVID-19 cases, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to the date mentioned, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Increasing number of COVID-19 cases and increasing reach
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports only the number of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained from government sources such as the Ministries of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities of countries and WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 am.
The data was used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare with what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day short-term incidence of COVID-19, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented the accumulated number of cases registered in each country as of 08:00 am on 15 March 2020 as compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the 14-day short-term increase in COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed trends in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, accumulated cases of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (complete ingredients).
This was mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar trend of increasing accumulated cases of COVID-19 (complete material).
Figure 2 compares the figures for Italy with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It is noteworthy that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported a total of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend observed in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is progressing at a comparative pace across all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different levels, despite the differences in national public health responses, and despite the different definitions of cases and protocols for selecting patients in countries that are likely to need to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Admissions data of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 survey of 29.2 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal in a 100,000 beds format showed a large gap between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (in 201011 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people).
Given the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases in each EU/EEA country and UK, the Healthcare Capacity Engagement Modelling situation shows that there is a > 90% risk of impaired intensive care bed capacity and is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
As incidents are still widespread in EU/EEA countries and some areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the population, it is advisable to make information available in the statistical format of regional unit naming for infected and intensive care beds level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the ongoing community infection situation of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for healthcare and especially intensive care, as happened in the affected areas of Italy, to increase the number of COVID-19 cases.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, pre-active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from repression to mitigation, as if not implemented ahead of time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and formulate their response accordingly.
Rapid risk assessment also provides a list of public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of time when countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world and infected more than 80,000 people, which has caused a disaster for humanity.
Similar to its corresponding virus, SARS-CoV-2 which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and can cause the same symptoms through the same procedure.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than SARS but is much more contagious and affects older men than young people and more women than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the topic of rapidly developing research.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, atology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, indicators of disease and prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help us understand and eliminate the terrifying disease.
The Spring Festival on 25th January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were asked to stay indoors for weeks during the holiday and beyond due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly correlated with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, on February 11, 2020, it was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its related disease was renamed CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to more than 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which over 40,000 patients have been released and over 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is 'the number one enemy of the people' and probably more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, over 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including viral, epidemiological, atology, diagnostic and treatment, which have ranked the virus separated from multiple patients.
The review seeks to summarize the progress of research in a new and fast developing field.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another COVID-related disease, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 pandemic).
We also discussed what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prediction and some of the remaining but urgent questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered to be non-fatal pathogens in humans, which basically cause about 15% of 4 common colds.
However, in this century, we have faced two high-pathogenic human bacterial CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which started an outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and which soon spread to many other countries with devastating symptoms and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded COVID outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the origin of pneumonia strains that were unknown were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CoV was released.
The first fatal incident in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic spread rapidly to surrounding cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were notified of the infection, indicating that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was shut down and all public transportation was suspended.
The first diagnostic study on the disease on 24 January found that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases came into direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood market, which is considered the starting point of infection from unknown animal sources.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
The situation is rapidly escalating and the final extent and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centric survey of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented the following updated data on the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has been mainly found in the age group of 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old, and only 14 of those infected were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has been a major hit with Huawei and its surroundings.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 to diagnosis.
The average incubation period of pathogens was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the coordinated R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases before 23 January 2020 was rapidly increasing, coinciding with the massive transportation period ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed case fatality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the coordinated mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subclass of large and wrapped viruses containing a single formula of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four classes or genres, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The wrapping key (S) glycoprotein for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, binds to its cellular subscriber angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptideal peptidase 4 (DPP4) and then the membrane is added.
Viral RNA is released into the genome cytoplasm; after making copies of the viral genome, the envelope forms a vecil or capsule with the genome RNA viron-containing glycoprotein and nucleocapside proteins, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be a new strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identification of more than 99.98% in 10 sequential samples collected from the Huan Seafood Market in Wuhan, the main site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 has a much greater similarity to SARS-CoV than MES-CoV genetically.
Through a penetrating electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultrafine part of the human respiratory epithelium.
It was found that human ACE2 had a receptor in addition to SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind relatively more weakly to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection among patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms an innovative small protein encoded by orf3b and can also make proteins encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in causing viral disease and inhibiting the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or pattern.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and others reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in mixed ingredients including amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the open and closed adaptive compound was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to two S proteins, providing evidence for detection and transmission of CoV.
To reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for pharmaceutical testing.
Primary and intermediate wear
It is reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread to humans through cats and camels respectively.
By comparing a phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the bat was considered a natural host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% equivalent to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate nutrient helped the virus to overcome the species' barriers to infecting humans and the path of transmission remains to be explained in detail.
Ji and others who introduced the snake as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is involved in the homologous reassembly of S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that 99% of the long-stemmed pangolin, a fungal mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine, found in SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology.
However, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are still awaited for some solid evidence (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 5 days in a dry environment outside the body at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity for up to 48 hours.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; other fat solvents other than ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine can effectively neutralize the virus.
The entire human race in general has a lack of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore is at risk of contracting the novel virus.
There are currently no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only see previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Typically, after a virus enters a patch, it is first identified by the patch-marking receptors of the patch by the patch's innate immune system. These receptors include C-type lactine-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
In a variety of ways, the virus stimulates the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that restrict viral transmission and accelerate the macrophageal phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to survive immune response.
Soon, the applied immune response also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell activity by inducing T cell death.
The body's immune system, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients resist MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the oversensitivity of the immune system locally produces a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ degeneration can even lead to death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a sudden onset, is more likely to affect older people with pre-existing conditions and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have a weak immune system to be more likely to become infected than others.
Based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days.
However, studies in 1,099 cases have shown that incubation period of the disease virus was on average 3 days and the range was from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a recent survey showed that the incubation period of pathogenicity was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the population of 8,866 cases.
Adjusting effective quarantine times based on the most accurate pathogen detection times is very important for health authorities to prevent transmission of the virus from infected but without symptoms.
As a general rule, people infected or exposed to the virus are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Is there a need to extend the quarantine to 24 days?
In most cases, fever is the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, nausea, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and vomiting.
A week after onset of disease some patients experienced dyspnia ( shortness of breath) and/or hypoxia.
In severe cases, patients develop rapidly with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory distress symptoms and severe fever should be tested for the virus in early diagnosis even if they do not have pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that 98% of the symptoms had fever, 76% had dry cough, 55% had dyspepnea and 3% had diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a class flare (family cluster) and a cluster of flare caused by infection from a person without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnia (55%).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which is much higher than the COVID-19 patients and consists of a higher MERS mortality rate than the COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients it was shown that fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnia (40% -42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13) -25%) were the main symptoms and about 14% -20% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
As of February 14, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while the confirmed cases reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS had a death rate of 8,096 confirmed cases, 10% as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
A previous study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 was as high as R0 of 6.47, whereas R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection has a higher potential to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
In a cluster, disease often starts in the same family or from the same collection or from the same vessel as a sea ship.
In most cases, patients have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other infected places or having been in contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms and patients who have recovered from hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or low number of endogenous white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphophenia and viralemia with white blood cell counts <4 × 109 / L including lymphocyte counts <1 × 109 / L and ascending aspartate aminotransferase levels were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
In some patients, the levels of hepatic and muscular emulsions and myoglobin in the blood increased, and in most patients, the blood levels of C-reactive proteins and erythrocytes increased.
In severe patients, levels of D-dimer, a fibrin-depleting product present in the blood, increased and lymphocyte counts decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by bilateral abnormal shading or abnormal crystal clearness in the lungs.
Patients often experience asymptomatic pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely jeopardize gas exchange.
The abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung expansion and increasing the risk of lung weakness.
So, the worst kind of test radiographic searches are often seen in the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the presence of multi-nucleated syncyte cells in the lungs of the deceased, including dissociation of the lymphocyte serum, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the disease, which are consistent with viral infection and pathology of ARDS and are similar in SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main measure for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the extremely high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, from February 13, 2020, clinical or diagnostic disclosures began to be used for diagnosis in China (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
The same situation has been observed in the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the connection between disease history, diagnostic demonstration, laboratory testing and radiological investigation is essential and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which uses depostics to detect isolated sections of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microloliter per input) in less than an hour without the need for extended materials.
The new technique is expected to dramatically increase sensitivity and yield when diagnostic samples are tested.
Due to lack of experience with novel CoV, doctors can provide mainly supportive care to COVID-19 patients with previously used or recommended therapies to treat other CoV groups such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).
The therapy includes antiviral medications, anti-immune response suppression, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support for current and potential treatments.
Plasma was even recommended for treatment from recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies have entered into competition to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and also probably attacks other organs that release ACE2 at lower doses such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and malfunction are the leading causes of death and death for patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and is life-saving, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that does not require cutting, and mechanical ventilation that does require cutting, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with Extrakorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology used to treat fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
It is also essential to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent and treat indirect infection and septic shock and protect the functioning of vital organs in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been reported that the cytokine disaster is caused by excessive immune response among SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine disruption is a form of systemic inflammatory response that occurs by the release of classes of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines secrete large numbers of free radicals through immune cells, which is a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Prevention of cytokine disaster is particularly important in the treatment of severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tossilizumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine disorders.
Other immunological response suppressor treatments for cytokine disaster include T cell-directed immunological response correction; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockage; JAK relieving; Blinatumobab (blinatumomab); cytokine signaling 4 suppressor; and HDAC reliefs.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
Although steroids at high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the likelihood of erection.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
As of this writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, interstitial application of Remdesivir, including nucleotide analogues, has been shown to be effective for a US patient with COVID-19.
Remedecivir is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed potential resistance to other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
On this basis, Gilead has supplied the compound to China to run a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and the results are highly anticipated.
Baricitinb (baricitinb), interferon-α, lopinavir/retonavir and ribavirin are recommended as potential therapies for patients with severe inflammatory symptoms.
Combined therapy with Lopinavir/Ritonavir may lead to diarrhea, vomiting, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The interaction of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibody production from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the spread of the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood in terms of pathogens.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other foreign substances and they identify and directly mitigate individual molecules of pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it, inflammation and viral load decreased and oxygen levels improved in the blood.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed and prior verification and clarification are necessary to propose methods for widespread use.
In addition, in terms of therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may over-excit the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are generally low, and plasma is in high demand for treating critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly at certain stages to fight against the global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes to monitor or encode effective antibodies against proteins needed by the virus.
This way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend largely on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula that varies depending on diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or unclear, as such ingredients or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those returning from the critical stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were known to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In many states of China, where TCM was used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, the highest recovery rates were found in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only roughly 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this is a fairly cumbersome comparison because many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and severity should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing combined treatment of WM and TCM with Western medicine (WM) treatment.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, to clear symptoms and to be hospitalized was significantly less in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the symbolic decline rate (light to severe) was significantly lower for WM+TCM groups alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower for WM+TCM groups alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is waiting for more controlled testing at larger scale and more centers.
It would also be interesting to identify the work process and, if possible, clarify the effective components or combinations of TCM treatment.
Most patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 experience a fear of highly contagious and even life-threatening illness, and quarantined people also experience isolation, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse treatment effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor exhaustion, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of infection, quarantine and the contamination of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have come into contact with them as well as the general public who need it.
Mental health support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple branches of medical science, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak and treatment plans of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are needed to prevent the chain of infection from animal reservoirs and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often complementary to antiviral treatments in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-lasting and strong antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to develop immune immunity.
Live attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, before a clinical study can begin, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in the living organisms and in the life-threatening model in elderly humans and against human-to-human transmission of the virus from animal sources has not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was wiped out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, the spread of MERS outbreaks and incidents continue in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the affected region.
Vaccination procedures for MERS have been developed using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Preparing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming this difficulty is challenging due to the long time (average 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and the dynamic change in the CoV population.
As a novel disease, the full course of diagnosis of COVID-19 has just begun to mature for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly, without prior illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a much higher morbidity and mortality rate in severely infected patients.
Therefore, it is essential for healthcare agencies to develop a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on diagnostic studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the rate of disease indicators in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the outcome of SARS disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the above 8,866 cases, COVID-19 was mainly among people aged 30-65 years, including 47.7% of those over 50.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have other conditions and complications at the same time, and they were significantly older than others (66 years of age vs. 51 years of age) which indicates age as an indicator of disease progression for the outcome of COVID-19 patient.
Gender: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Multiple disease and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer severe heart attack and arrhythmias.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may bind to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which may result in liver malfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying disease are closely related and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal data in the laboratory: Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to tissue and have been suggested as an indicator of the rate of disease for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The interaction between COVID-19 severity and prediction with CRP levels was also suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These emitted substances are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during cell damage.
So, they are the conventional marker for heart or liver failure.
Key Diagnostic Symptoms: For the prediction of the complications and consequences of COVID-19, along with other problems, breast radiography and periodic progression of diagnostic symptoms should be considered.
Use of steroids: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used among severe SARS patients, many of the descendants suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with chronic disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients often endured prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and were subjected to abnormal stress as they saw family members and fellow patients die.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from SARS.
In addition to creating replicas in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate on the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at the initial stage of infection, which is similar to other CoVs responsible for common cold.
Therefore, patients who are infected in the early stages or during the early stages of the disease can produce large amounts of viruses during the daily work.
However, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and difficult to control.
There are currently significant efforts in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities in the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
While these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most promising prediction is that the outbreak will end in March and the downward phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which is proving to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat lalarese in patients recovering and discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus will have a similar cyclical phase to influenza.
However, the falling number of new cases in China is giving optimistic indications that current strategies may have worked.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would cause half a million deaths, including one million cases.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become infectious and eventually become extinct or become a relatively low-infectious virus in human interaction.
The comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, even through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with contaminants contaminated by the virus.
The virus was found in the mouth, which highlights the new potential for mouth-to-mouth infection.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41% of cases were likely caused by nasocomal (hospital-derived) infections, including 17 other pre-existing patients and 40 healthcare providers.
In this way, adequate care should be taken to keep people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those around the sick or infected people safe.
Wearing masks can be used as the first stage of protection to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series #1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or getting stuck on the surface of the object, from where they could spread to others.
However, only N95 (Series #1860s) masks can protect against small viral respiratory receptions of 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virus is able to enter completely; the size of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can even enter through five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come into direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series#1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus likely entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also ensure that patients wear transparent face coverings or eyeglasses when working.
In the public areas affected or potentially affected, everyone is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves and to limit exposure to potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet is considered appropriate for a person to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to the human world as a new virus, China should have taken high caution based on deep memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV, according to a report dated January 7, 2020.
However, prior to 19 January 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Centre for Disease Control had reassured citizens that the novel virus is less contagious and human-to-human reproductive capacity is limited and there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly eased public fears, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival and significant time was wasted in the fight against the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can learn from this rigorous learning and make vital improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious when making public announcements because each word will be considered by citizens and it can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unsolicited information from clinics without waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more regulatory in suppressing potential epidemics in the early stages rather than trying to console the public; and (4) issue frequently targeted and effective practices aimed at raising public awareness of disease outbreaks and periodically testing and improving community response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and, as of this writing, it has spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and is also similar to the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling of SARS returning.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for the suppression of the pandemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than young people and women more than older people and the severity and mortality rates are higher among older people than young people.
The death rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even without symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so in a serious illness, making it much more difficult to contain COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recover can be positive for the virus again.
These discoveries dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several important issues remain to be addressed:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What was the primary nutrient, such as the intermediate species, for transmitting the virus from bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively curb the spread of infection and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory cells and cause subsequent metabolic changes?
Does the virus also block ACE2 receptor cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus genetically propagate during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, a death like SARS, or a recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it takes time to find answers to the above and many more questions.
But no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
Transformation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its nutrients, including humanity, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness like the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the currency to reveal how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to the top of the discussion and surprised us with higher transmission and lower pathogenicity compared to our sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal disease and understanding the zoonotic source of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Some HCoVs have also been identified as intermediate shelters.
Animal nutrient detection has a direct effect on human immunity.
Investigating the exchange of CoV hosts between animals can also provide important insights into human transmission of CoV.
In this review, we provide a summary of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery as well as their animal sources and interconnected infections.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome reconnection.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.
In addition, the need for successful shelter changes and the effects of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV-group) belongs to the family of coronavirus, which includes a group of coated, positive-sensitive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses, which harbor the largest genome of 26 to 32 kB of RNA viruses, were designated as ""CoV"" due to the crown-like organ structure under the electron microscope".
Structurally, the CoVs have an integral genome that is of the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome has two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted (translated) into pp1a and pp1ab replicate polyproteins.
Polyproteins are processed to produce 16 more non-structural proteins, which are named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including keylock (S), wrapping (E), membrane (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four masses (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV, and Delta-CoV), of which the Beta-CoV masses contain the majority of HCoVs and are divided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Ethnic evidence shows that bats and mice serve as the gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main source for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have steadily overcome interspecies barriers and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been reported.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute low-respiratory tract infections in a relatively high number of patients with a higher chance of being released outside the lungs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was collected from the nasal discharge of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak the idea was widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the most devastating events in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and causing roughly 10% of all deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak has continued to spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the effective agent of the current coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm clock is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal origins from bats, mice or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary source of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The animal origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving forces and the reasons for species-to-species (species jumping) restrictions.
Along with important implications in preventing future spillovers, it can guide or guide the search for the origin, intermediate and amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In this review, we present a summary of the animal sources, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of the HCoVs.
In particular, we want to raise public awareness of this general context and discuss that the HCoV-type pathogenic viruses are usually pathogenic among their natural hosts but become pathogenic once they enter the body of the new host.
We also review the evolutionary trends of HCoVs where infectiousness often decreases with increased infectiousness.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoVs were collected from various infected animals including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs before the first collection of B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from the nasal secretions of common cold patients.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A chronological summary of the history of HCoV detection (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Common cold symptoms including headache, dizziness, nausea and sore throat were seen in HCoV-229E infected patients, and fever and cough were reported in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from repeated growth of the virus in the brains of organ cultures and subsequently dairy mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are seen as symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally spread and are mainly infected in the winter climate during the subtropical season.
Typically, the onset of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A study of human volunteers found that healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only some patients with immunodeficiency disabilities experienced severe low-respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first recorded HCoV-related epidemic in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS was found in Guangdong province, China, in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak has resulted in 8,096 cases reported across multiple countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and with the onset of illness on the 10th day, could increase the viral load to about two additional cases.
In patients with SARS-CoV, muscle aches, headaches, fever, discomfort and cold symptoms were initially associated with shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress.
Lymphophenia, impaired liver function testing and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Dispersed alveolar damage, proliferation of subcutaneous cells and growth of macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation later in life.
In addition to the respiratory tract, multiple organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can be infected in severe cases, usually with cytokine disruption that can be especially fatal in patients with low immune system defects.
The virus was first collected from an open lung biopsy of a relative of an indicated patient travelling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially common in young children, elderly and respiratory ill patients with low immunity.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in cholera, cataracts, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is identified as the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and has the highest incidence in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the abstract laryngitis, also known as the croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to group-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute diarrheal disease.
HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which is the cause of mild respiratory disease.
All four of these group-derived HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as the rare case of the highly harmful subtype of HCoV-NL63 which has recently been reported to cause severe low-respiratory sinus infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs gain the ability to functionally transmit and maintain their presence in humans, they become relatively less harmful or contagious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had been diagnosed with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases have been reported from outside, with a secondary phase outbreak in close contact occasionally in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another second phase outbreak in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The diagnostic manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, are similar to those of SARS.
In addition to SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced severe renal impairment, which is unique among HCoV-induced diseases in MERS so far.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach ailments such as diarrhea and dizziness.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed a mortality rate of more than 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for the human body.
In mid-to-late December 2019, classes of pneumonia patients were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as having been traditionally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and has designated the disease as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, with a total mortality rate of 3.4%, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
Notably, the death rate for Huawei in China is 4.2%, while the death rate is just above 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes fatal respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches of the racially-occurring tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is relatively less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
No symptom-free cases have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 and it may play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals highly interesting similarities and differences.
First, the time of onset of the pathogen and the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is mediated between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63), which are publicly transmitted.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are typically seen with non-specific, mild or even symptomless presentations during community acquired HCoV-type infections.
On the other hand, a small proportion of severe cases of COVID-19 also show symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection group shows interesting characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the group-dominated HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission rate decreases with SARS-CoV-2 as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a mouse sample.
It remains to be clarified by future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 vaginal infection plays a significant role in at least some cases such as SARS-CoV-2 in some circumstances.
It is of particular interest to the community to see whether SARS-CoV-2 shows similar seasonal dependence to the emerging HCoVs.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission will influence the outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four sub-groups of mild symptom-causing HCoVs have adapted well to all humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may be descendants of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and those that develop serious HCoV disease have been killed.
To do this, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to accumulate adaptive strains that fight against the causes of hospice restriction.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If properly adapted, it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans by quarantine or other means of infection control.
For many years, four strains of the virus have been spreading to the human population, causing common cold cases in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not need any animal support.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and cannot sustain human transmission.
They need to be maintained and propagated on their zoonotic bases and perhaps seek opportunities to propagate to sustainable human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying nutrients.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs, both of which are similar.
So far, it is as highly contagious as community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than the group-derived HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will have to see if it adapts fully to humans and continues to spread among humans without any underlying or intermediate animal clothing.
Before discussing the animal source of HCoVs, we will benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, Aadhaar, intermediate and extension hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it provides shelter to closely related ancestors by sharing higher homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The paternal virus is usually well adapted to the host's body and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, an Aadhaar shelter provides HCoVs with continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its pathogenic virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or just around introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and may act as an amplifying host in temporarily replicating the virus and then expanding the level of human infection by transmitting it to the human body.
If HCoVs cannot continue transmission between intermediate hosts, the transmission may be slowed.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and trigger long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate material becomes the natural base material.
The epidemiological data traditionally revealed that the SARS indicator had a history of contact with the animals of prey.
Subsequent Seroprevalence investigations have indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than among the general population.
In the pet markets of the guinea pig (Paguema larvae) and the feral animal, a raccoon dog was first identified as carrying a virus similar to SARS-CoV that was almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after all the Gandagoku were killed in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm seavots from wild or farms without exposure to live animal markets were primarily negative for SARS CoV, indicating that masked palm seavots will act as only an intermediate amplifier shelter and not as a natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the Guangzhou market has anti-SARS-CoV antibodies to different species, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate amplifying nutrients to SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
These are all considered to be one-way carriers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent research into the natural animal feed of SARS-CoV  has revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinolophase bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese equine bat. Subsequent research has revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related rhinolophase bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese equine bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new idea that bats provide shelter for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoV strains (SL-CoV strains) have been identified from bats, but none can be collected as live viruses except a designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a subscriber of SARS-CoV.
Frogs, civets and humans were shown to use ACE2 as receptors for entering WIV1 cells from frog mole samples.
Interestingly, the serums of patients with SARS who were recovering were able to disable WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which share 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high level of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus and bats are not an immediate sponsor of SARS-CoV.
Phylegenetic analyses classify MERS-CoV into the same class as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat uses the same host receptor, Diptydeyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter the CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus.
RNA polymerization sequences of RNA-based MERS-CoV are phylogenetically close to replicas of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate sponsor of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that single-stemmed camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV specific sedative antibodies, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to the human virus was collected from the nose swab of a camel with a tail, which further suggests that the camel acts as the true base carrier for MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that in camels that are experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, there has been a lot of viral shedding, although usually mild symptoms.
It is noteworthy that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory system but also through the urinary-oral tract, which is also the main route of transmission of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain because many confirmed cases of MERS did not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly of human-to-human transmission or of the pathways of infection involving any unknown animal species that shelter MERS-CoV.
The bat CoV RaTG13 collected from the Rhinofos affinis bat has a 96.2% homology with the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine parental relationships.
This means that if almost identical bat CoVs are not found in the future, bats may not be a direct carrier of SARS-CoV-2.
Probably, the animal shelter in the midst of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife sold and killed in the Huan Seafood wholesale market, with many early cases of COVID-19 being associated, suggesting a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metzinomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as bonruis (Manis Javanika) may also carry SARS-CoV-2 related genetic beta-CoVs.
The novel is a replica of the 85-92% of the Bonroe CoV genomes of the nucleotide sequence homology SARS-CoV-2.
However, with approximately 90% homogeneity at the level of nucleotide sequences, they are equally associated with RaTG13.
They cluster in two sub-families of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 on the racially related tree, one of which shares a similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 identifying a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although sequence homology is higher in genomes.
A previous study on ill Bonroe also reported detection of a continuous sequence of viral infections from lung samples, which have been shown to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to create partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of full-length viral genomes.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequential differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonnaroo-related beta-CoV-2 groups.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 groups.
The evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 among bats, pangolins and other mammals have not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and RBDs in Botswana, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-compounds, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-based sequence homology.
It is highly unlikely that the high similarity between the beta-CoVs associated with RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-centered evolution.
An anti-proposal for a re-combination between SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13 is a link between a third wildlife species.
As a driving force in evolution, the reconnection between the beta-CoV-groups is widespread.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylegenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat CoVs, although the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A bat CoV, called ARCoV.2 (Apalachian Ridge CoV), identified in North American trips with HCoV-NL63 has been reported to show close association.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another batch of CoV, known as Hippocydrosis/Ghanacoma /19/2008, although camelliads are also suspected to be the intermediate.
For clarity, the known animal sources of HCoVs are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events in the history of CoV-groups.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed through the species and infected humans from domestic animals, a respiratory epidemic occurred.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively unclear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpha-alpha CoV.
Several evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, in shared ecological environments, it can be from the interaction of bats with humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, people have a close relationship with Alpacar.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic among the alpha-CoV-group of bats, while the alpaca-CoV-infected animals cause respiratory disease outbreaks.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.
Thus, the possibility that alpacas get HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not very surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
While bats act as the gene pool of the alpha-CoV-type HCoV-229E, alpacas and one-legged camels can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of spreading interspecies transmission from bats to bats and from bats to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known from early detection and is further confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, calmly colonized, close social exchange and strong flight skills are the ideal conditions for bats to be a 'viral spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV came into contact with a duck camel decades ago.
It fits well with these camels which have gone from an intermediate host to a stable and natural-based host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low transmission rate among these animals.
The spread of MERS-CoV among humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of the camel in MERS-CoV , the role of pangolin in SARS-CoV-2 infection is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic among pangolin-containing pangolins.
They may be the last refuge for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs similar to the Gandagoculi in the case of SARS-CoV.
The possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from interspecies to humans may be included or discarded in future studies.
First, bats may be the base host for a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental niche with bats through the jabai or coal mining.
Second, the Bonrouis may be among the intermediate amplifier hosts where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected by cutting and eating prey.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are immune to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals has confirmed the antibodies.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the reconciliation and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred among third species that have contacts with both bats and pangolins.
The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Besides the different types of animal shelters, three main factors of viral side are also important in helping CoVs overcome interspecies barriers.
First, they have a relatively high rate of transcription in RNA.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated transmission rate of the CoV-set can be considered to be ""medium"" to ""high"" depending on the decline in novel nutrient CoV adaptation, and the average replacement rate will be ~10-4 replacements per site per year".
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, which removal results in excessive variability and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of remdesivir is known to form a CoV replicate by mitigating this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerization.
Remdesvir is one of the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 ingredients tested in diagnostic trials.
Nevertheless, the transmission rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the conversion rate is often higher when the CoVs cannot adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with higher transmission rates, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low, indicating a greater degree of human adaptation.
It may have already adapted to another shelter near the person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a single-toed camel.
In theory, the genetic drift of SARS-CoV-2 is highly unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals ineffective quickly.
Second, large RNA of CoV uses extra flexibility in genome transcription to translate and reconnect the genome, thus increasing the probability of evolution including interconnection, which when conditions become favorable favors the emergence of a CoV-group.
It is supported by a lot of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3′ edge of the genome.
"Third, CoV-clusters alter templates when they replicate RNA randomly and often through a unique ""copy-like"" process".
Strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA replication in the host mixture that serves as a mixture pot.
Higher homogeneous full-length and subgenome RNAs can reconnect to form new CoV-clusters.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural reconciliation has been found between both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and between animal CoV-sets such as Bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Interaction of the virus-promoting agent in relation to infection
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral exchange with host receptors is another key factor influencing interspecies infection.
Among these, the reincarnation of SARS-CoV is taken as a prime example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies infections occurred.
Based on comparative analysis of the collection of human and venomous SARS-CoV-CoV, it is thought that SARS-CoV can adapt rapidly to mutations of RBD, especially S proteins, among different hosts.
RBD usually interacts with a cellular receptor on an S protein of a CoV and is highly selective by response to host antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is composed of 318th to 510th amino acids in the S1 fragment that bind to human ACE2 as well as its corceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, seabirds, mice and raccoon dogs, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differ from the odorless viral isolates in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are in the customer-focused design to interact with ACE2 clients.
The coveted SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the affinity of spike protein exchange with the ACE2 receptor in humans.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be critical for human viral adaptation.
It is noteworthy that the cellular clients of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar.
The 30% difference between the S1 unit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV suggests that the tendency of its S protein to bind to human ACE2 may vary.
In fact, a CREO-EM study indicates a tendency for a 10- to 20-fold higher bonding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins that tend to exist.
It is also important to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worryingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2, but with a separate subset of S.
There are many other HCoVs, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialytic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be a factor in the successful adaptation of the group of CoVs to humans after being transmitted from their animal host to the intraspecies.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcomes of interspecies transmission of HCoV-groups are also driven by factors of dependence and restriction on other hosts.
The breakdown of these host proteins between humans and HCoVs, the natural hosts of the HCoVs, such as bats, one-legged camels and mice, may prevent interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependence factors for a successful interspecies infection and destroy the host restriction factors.
In this case, the molecular determinants of this important area of virus-associated exchange have yet to be identified and characterized.
Neutral genomic-wide screening of host dependence and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The rise of the novel HCoV: Back to where it started
The diversity of bat CoVs provides significant opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, the bat acts as a gene pool of the CoV-type HCoV-type.
In addition, rapid transplants and genetic reconnection drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the ability to radically modify acquired or lost viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV related proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation because SARS-CoV related bat viruses were collected but have been found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide elimination feature of the SARS-CoV-type has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and appears to be an adapted transition that encourages shelter switching.
In addition, there is a history of possible reconciliation of SARS-CoV with the alpha- and gamma-CoV-groups, where large numbers of small reconciliation zones were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
The recombination positions were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic went through a series of strain-reconnections, which occurred in a Saudi Arabian duck-tailed camel.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of reassortment have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs reassort with other animal CoVs in genes that are not their constituent.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly resulting in the release of viruses from selective pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of the bi-nucleotide.
While the intact ORF4 HCoV-229E can be seen in bats and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide placed inside, with the result being seen in the frame shift.
But last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the underlying selection pressures.
When the bats were infected with CoV they were symptomless or only mildly symptomatic, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CoV-group and the bats.
It has been found that bats are well adapted to the CoV group in terms of origin and physiology.
For example, errors in triggering responses to inflammation in bats effectively reduce pathology driven by the CoV-group.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats has been suppressed due to low levels of release of inhibitory natural killer cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Furthermore, suppressing the replication of high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high metabolic activity of bats and influencing the pre-filling by exoribonucleases can both do this, thus providing the selection pressure necessary to produce strains of the virus when coming into contact with a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also develop through re-synthesis which leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So, the likelihood of three new HCoVs emerging in the last two decades is not a coincidence.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host species such as bats and camels.
They grow strongly without strong resistance from the host.
The secret to why there are no symptoms and what causes serious human infections lies in this.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to over-activation of the immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of symptomless carriers, the immune response was differentiated from the CoV replicas.
The same tactic of disconnecting immune responses may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the application of Type I interference should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
By this argument, NLRP3 may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19 with MCC950.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common causes that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV has been found to exchanged 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, while on the other hand, there is a bat CoV that exchanged 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While the Gandagook and other animals found on the market have been reported to have sheltered viruses similar to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate shelters for SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
An unusually similar BONRUI beta-CoV-set has been found with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the BONRUI will act as one of the intermediate hosts or may contribute to the gene segment in the final version of the BONRUI beta-CoV-set SARS-CoV-2.
While questions arise, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either deliberately or accidentally man-made.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have once again been the focus of discussion.
The study of the CoV cluster in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal sources and the animal basis of the HCoV cluster in human transmission.
There is extensive evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a foul source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and mosquitoes in the market, killing mosquitoes there by closing the wet market could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
According to the same argument, in the context of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolin should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, what and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through wild boar and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in single-clawed camels.
In addition to being an important means of transportation, the camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local people.
They are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in the Chinese wildlife market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for rats in combination with other infection control measures.
We cannot eliminate these viruses, which could lead to an outbreak of new genotypes.
Many types of animal CoVs are spread in nature.
In particular, the bat CoVs with animal potential are very diverse.
These zoonotic CoVs have a high potential to propagate and reconnect, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or fatal to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of wildlife eating in some parts of China should be abandoned.
With the fire tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better plan of preparation and response.
Many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They remain on their own natural basis until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chance of humans being exposed to bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the CoVs and their natural host ecosystems, which will prove effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne disease in humans is to stay away from the environmental niche of the natural basis of animal viruses.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 parental virus to the wild, it is necessary to see under what conditions bats and wild can share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human infection, it should be determined how humans are exposed to bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate nutrient, it must clarify how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals including pets can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and test infections should be carried out.
If it is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical progenitor viruses will be identified in its natural habits in the future.
Continuous investigations in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have significant impacts on COVID-19 prevention and control in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria for suspected COVID-19 and confirmed cases.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the detection and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infections and this guide provided our experience and created good reference for fighting this pandemic globally.
However, due to the fact that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, the findings of ongoing research and the experience of clinical practice, our awareness and knowledge are also increasing, so the diagnostic and treatment techniques are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided brand new diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases, according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was renamed as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported.
On 11 March 2020, WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick advice guide and it was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has generated a huge response.
Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also increasing based on ongoing research findings and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Medical Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been published in a total of seven editions, each with significant changes in content.
Now that Zhou and his colleagues have commented on our guidelines, they have suggested a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and has also provided valuable reference for the global pandemic.
We approve and thank them for their remarkable work.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and medical guidelines (trial 7th edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh version (3 March 2020), in order to confirm suspected cases, a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical characteristics, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, then three clinical symptoms must be filled in.
Epidemiological history: (1) history of residents of or traveling to Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (coming positive for a nucleic acid test); (3) history of exposure to patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City or surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of exposure to small cases of confirmed cases (such as home, office, school class, etc.) and 2 weeks of exposure to respiratory infections (such as small fever, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell counts at the initial leakage stage show normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts.
To diagnose confirmed cases based on the confirmed case, there should be any of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive on a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic real-time PCR test; (2) high homogenization or similarity to a known novel coronavirus in full gene sequencing of the virus; (3) positive on a serum test for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2; or positive on a variant of a SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody negative, and ≥4 times greater than the suspected growth of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the serum than in the critical stages.
We found that the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions included real-time PCR testing and blood samples for the respiratory nucleic acid diagnostic.
Diagnostic pathogenesis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find a blood sample with respiratory valve samples to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, which increases the availability of various samples and which helps bring certain antibody positive results to a certain standard.
Moreover, more evidence has been found that reminds us to be cautious about patients with irregular symptoms and those without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou and his colleagues should update the flow list, as they classify those without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The score system also needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will be called to comment.
To identify suspected cases and to diagnose confirmed cases, we recommend identifying them and following the latest guidelines in your country.
Our team will update our guidelines in time to help.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths due to daily peak COVID-19.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Pathology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that among the recorded cases of infection, 114 active cases and 33 recoveries were reported to have been at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR Director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Mirzaadi, two of the cases are over 60, two are between 51 and 60 years old and one is between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saiful Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maithri Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Kadir said that public transport will be closed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
The closure of the public transportation was started on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical supplies, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March among two individuals returning from Italy and one of their wives.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 infected people have exceeded one million
The total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has surpassed one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to the coronavirus-caused disease, COVID-19.
The important event took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed their first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea had until Thursday claimed to be one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the WHO has recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours on April 4 at 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, including at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 people died in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infections.
Countries around the world have announced tough measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobanin extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments will be maintained until April 30 if Russians do not go to work.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one against were cast.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the whole day; the previous curfew was only in effect from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand planned to implement curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia have lowered the threshold for toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Wolworths and Coles lowered the restrictions on purchasing toilet paper per transaction at all stores nationwide to two and one package respectively.
In addition, ALDI has introduced a one-pack limit on Sabbar.
These restrictions were posted as messages in check outs and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Shoppers were reportedly rallying for fear of COVID-19 with the idea of isolating themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the sale of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes follow the previous transaction restrictions of four packs that Woolworths and Coles launched on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles announced that the four-pack ban had been introduced in various places, but that ""many stores still sell everything within an hour of delivery"", a demand they described as ""unprecedented"" and in a Facebook post on Tuesday at ALDI they described it as ""unexpected"".
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales rose sharply last week.
Costco stores in Canberra were also allowed for two packs last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the repayment rate, while Woolworths orders additional stocks, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on delivery by truck made the matter more difficult.
As suppliers try to meet demand, he expects production costs to increase.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after the stock was already out, some stores will not be able to hold special sales on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, retail expert Dr Gary Mortimer from Queensland University of Technology said stores fill their inventory every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy material which makes it very small in quantity and when all is sold, the huge shelves are empty and the feeling of shortage is reinforced.
"According to ABC News, "Coles and Woolworths feel that if they have a lot of stuff, and they [can buy] stuff like toilet rolls and sanitisers, and they have enough, that fear might be reduced", said Russell Zimmerman.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who builds Clinix toilet tissue and solar paper that makes the equipment, insisted they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at the Melbourne auction, some of which were due to the fact that buyers were given a long working weekend.
In this Thursday edition of the daily NT News in Darwin, an eight-page annex is given for cutting into pieces and used as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on 3 March said stores were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their shopping.
Russell Zimmerman also said that there is a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, hand washes and flour.
Similarly, the sale of paper used for the Andress toilet in the online British supermarket Okado is restricted to two 12-roll packs every Sunday evening outside Australia.
WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic due to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
"Although the term 'epidemic' does not refer to how dangerous specific cases are but to how widespread any disease has become, the World Health Organization has pointed to the need for governments to act:"
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic".
"WHO Secretary General Adnanom Ghebreyesus said that if states can identify,"" they can test, treat, isolate, identify and unify".
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of disease transmission and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity".
"According to Dr. Tom Freuden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is 'unprecedented.'"
"In a February CNN comment, he said, ""The time of continuous global spread from the origin of any other respiratory virus except influenza has not been traced"."
"Gabrasas shares the same view, saying, ""We have never seen a coronavirus pandemic before"."
He continued, "And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new status of global pandemic follows WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"The fact is, things are going to get worse", said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide is at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and Union Territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
In China, the mortality rate is estimated at 4%, while worldwide, the range ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary care is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering your face when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and monitoring and isolating yourself for people who suspect infection.
Global authorities have responded by closing travel controls, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and facilities.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruption, the cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and increased supply shortages due to fear of shopping.
Schools and universities are now closed nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against other people in China, East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas where cases of the virus have been reported, depending on their race and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, for unknown reasons, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and so the virus is believed to have some animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, Bonrui coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The person who first reported the symptoms was later reported to have become ill on 1 December 2019; and subsequently the person had no visible connection to the Wet Market cluster.
The market was linked to two-thirds of the initial clusters of cases in December 2019.
On 13 March 2020, a misreport in the South China Morning Post indicated that a case that may have been the first to be found on 17 November 2019, was among a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that new infections in China were reported to have decreased, but increased abruptly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
The number of cases may be low, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, most of them under the age of 19, and 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Valence, chief scientific adviser to the UK, estimates that 60% of the UK population in the working population need to be infected before they can gain immunity.
According to the Official Protocol, cases are the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had developed official policies not to test only those with mild symptoms.
A survey published on 16 March found that as of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China were undetected and these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official accounting for infections.
The initial estimate of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 at the start was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it is likely 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not, the time between symptoms and death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
About 97,000 deaths were reported to be related to COVID-19 as of 10 April 2020.
In China, 80% of deaths in people over 60 years of age as of 5 February, and 75% of those people had pre-existing conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. Government statistics on deaths from COVID-19 generally indicate those who were infected with COVID according to traditional rules.
The death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - such as at home, nursing home, etc.
Some partial data from Italy showed that the number of over-deaths during the pandemic has increased 4-5 times the official COVID death rate.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that ""we know that [the number of deaths reported] is less speculative than the actual number"", a statement made by reports that are not based on low-count data in the United States. Such underestimates occur frequently in global pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed deaths occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths have been reported in nearly forty countries and territories on all continents of the world except Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to the region, and are influenced by population characteristics such as the amount of testing, the quality of health care systems, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health. The mortality-infection ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time frame.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, worldwide death-to-case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by region.
In China, the mortality-to-case ratio has dropped from 17.3% (of those with symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (of those with first symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other preventive measures fall under - case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and infection-to-infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or unspecified) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited to any time period and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that overall mortality from the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculations above this range are consistent with a statistical study of the first allopathic test of COVID-19 in Germany and an analysis of the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The maximum and deadline for outbreaks are uncertain and may vary by location.
"As the disease goes from untested to infectious outbreaks usually dominate, and then it begins to decay when the disease no longer has a host", said McKeyes Bonney of Penn State University.
But at this point, it's almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when that will happen.
"Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhang Nanshang argued that if all countries could unite to follow WHO advice to prevent the spread of the virus, it could be "finished by June".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""will likely continue to spread for a year or two".""
"According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures are required to be maintained ""until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"William Scheffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's quite unlikely that the coronavirus -- because it's so rapidly spreading -- will disappear completely"" and it could become ""a seasonal disease, coming back every year"".
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and range of transmission.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected individuals may be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The most common symptoms include: constipation, cough, loss of breathing ability, shortness of breath, joint pain, sore throat, headache, body cold, vomiting, coffee cough, hypertension, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden confusion, waking up and blue faces or lips as emergencies; it is recommended that immediate medical attention be sought if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm infection, so researchers have recommended that people who have been exposed to confirmed infections be monitored and tested to avoid infection.
Chinese estimates of symptomless ratios range from a few to 44%.
The range of the general incubation stage (the period during which infection and symptoms begin) is from one day to 14 days; the incubation period is five days. In the example of uncertainty, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially got the odor disappeared accounted for 30% and those who subsequently got the odor disappeared accounted for 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly by small droplets produced during close contact and coughing, sneezing or speaking; close contact means being between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that water particles can range from an open cough to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some people believe that the virus can also be transmitted by tiny fluid droplets that can be produced when speaking, which remain in the air for long periods of time.
Hydrocytes can enter the mouth or nose of those nearby or they can enter the lungs through breathing.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can result in respiratory excretion becoming aerosol and as a result can be airborne.
It can also spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or face.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the mall, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of mouth-borne infection with SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that infection can occur before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reported lab-confirmed symptomless cases, but some countries have identified symptomless infections during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person typically infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus is found in plastic (polypropylene) for three days, 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and four hours in copper.
It varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as infected humans do after touching other surfaces.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel and novel virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a group of severe respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All features of novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronavirus found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from domestic soap as it breaks the immune gland of the virus.
It's thought to be a source of animal disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically combined with strains from two bats in the subgenus Serbecovirus (lineage B) with the genus B.
In another bat's coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13) the total genome level is 96% accurate.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers in a study found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the virus in Bonnui and the virus in the human body.
Compared to the entire genome to date, it has been found that there is a 92% genetic similarity between the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 at high levels, which is insufficient to prove that the virus acted as a host in the middle.
Infection can be diagnosed by virus depending on the symptoms temporarily, but ultimately confirms the reverse transmission polymerization chain response (rRT-PCR) or city imaging of infected lalaras.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and many of its imaging features are consistent with other processes of pneumonia and disease.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""".
WHO has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually seen within hours to days.
The test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. Several laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
None of these have been proven to be valid enough to be approved for long-range use as of 6 April 2020.
The serological test, manufactured by Chelsex in the United States, is authorized to be used only in approved laboratories in emergency situations.
Characteristic features of taking pictures on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include opaque peripheral ground glass and absence of plural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images from confirmed case studies.
The PCR has restricted the creation of any images and the detection of COVID-19 without confirmation for mixing with other infections such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared PCR with chest CT results and explained that while imaging of the infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive which suggests considering it as a screening tool in the pandemic-affected areas.
The AI-based innovation birth control has been developed that produces the virus's characteristics through radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining good personal hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or face with unwashed hands, and digging or coughing in the tissue and throwing the tissue straight into a garbage can.
Those who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments have advised or controlled against all unnecessary travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the point of spreading to the masses in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the public and some people in the public community do not know where or how they became infected. Healthcare providers who serve anyone who may be infected are recommended to use evidence warnings, exposure warnings and eye protection.
The administration's use of mobile phone location information for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations issued statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on privacy-optimized solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log in to the mobile phones of others near a user.
Users will then receive a message if they come into contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive. There are several misconceptions about how to prevent the infection.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to develop one.
Hand washing was recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visible dirty; before eating; before flushing their noses, during coughing, or sneezing.
Because the virus can be killed by domestic soap outside the human body, which breaks the virus's protective bubble.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available at hand, at least 60% alcohol-containing sanitizers should be used instead.
WHO advises people not to touch their eyes, nose or face with unclean hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a few solvents (within one minute of contact with disinfectants in the case of stainless steel surfaces), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate are comparatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a location such as an office or day care, then the electronic devices used in the office, bathroom, common space, shared areas, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their face and nose with their elbows or cover the tissue with paper during coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of the tissue properly.
Surgical masks are recommended for those at risk of infection. A mask can control the amount of waterborne particles emitted during speech, dizziness or coughing and the extent of spread.
WHO has issued a guideline on when and how to wear masks.
"According to virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds, ""masks may reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene"."
WHO has advised healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their own face.
Some countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of fabric. China specifically recommends disposable medical masks for healthy members of the population, especially when approaching other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended wearing a surgical mask while traveling on public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned the wearing of face masks or face coverings when going outside.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask while traveling to populated places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has issued a decree requiring a face mask to be worn when entering every grocery store.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear face masks whenever they go outside.
Taiwan, which has been producing about a million masks a day since mid-March, will require passengers to wear face masks on trains and interstate buses to travel on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks whenever you go out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy face masks wear homemade face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes controlling the spread of infection by reducing close contact between individuals and slowing the spread of disease.
The measures include: quarantine; travel restrictions; closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by being away from home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without touching and maintaining physical distance from each other.
The government is now mandating or recommending social distancing in many areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum combined size of the population was reduced from 250 people (unless COVID-19 is known to have spread in the region) to 50 people and then to 10 people, according to recommendations from US government authorities and health agencies.
"Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people on 22 March 2020. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immunity face an increased risk of serious illness and complications, and in areas of society where there is an outbreak, the CDC advised them to stay at home as much as possible. In late March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing", to explain that it aims to maintain physical contact with or maintain physical distance from virtual presence or social contact".
The use of the term ""social distancing"" has affected people in a way that has led to complete social isolation rather than encouraging them to maintain contact with others in alternative ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic".
It included only suggestions for having sex with someone who lives with you who does not have the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect themselves infected.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation. Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine of all residents living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a high infection are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
The techniques of control of any outbreak are containment or suppression measures and containment.
The controls were carried out in the early stages of the outbreak, and other infection control measures were launched and vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease among the remaining population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken to slow the spread slightly and reduce its impact on healthcare systems and society.
At the same time, both containment (containment) and mitigation (removal) may have to take a mixed standard.
More extreme measures should be taken in the suppression to reverse the epidemic cycle to less than 1 in the number of initial reproductions. Reducing the maximum epidemic limit is part of the outbreak management of an infectious disease, known as the epidemic curve levelling.
It is found to reduce healthcare risks and allow more time for vaccination and treatment to be improved.
Other ways other than medication that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; public measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; acknowledging other such measures and engaging the public to participate; as well as environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have adopted several standards to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has launched mass testing and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the manufacture of face masks and increased the penalty for medical supply fraud.The efforts of Great Britain and the United States prove that mitigation (slowing but not preventing the spread of the pandemic) and repression (increasing the response to the pandemic) are a major challenge.
While the most desirable eradication policies can reduce the maximum healthcare demand by two thirds and deaths by half, health systems are still flooding, resulting in millions of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus continues to spread to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it comes first), as measures are relaxed otherwise the virus infection will return quickly.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have caused social and economic damage.
No specific antiviral medicines have been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medicines.
Over-the-counter cold medication, fluid intake, and rest can alleviate symptoms.
Depending on how severe the disease is, oxygen therapy, intravenous (via vein) fluid and breathing assistance may be needed.
Steroid use can lead to worse outcomes.
Several compounds approved for the treatment of other viral diseases in the past are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO further stated that some traditional and home remedies help to alleviate the symptoms that SARS-CoV-19 causes.
The acquisition of health centres for COVID-19 patients with increased capacity and capacity has been described by WHO as a preventive measure to prevent the outbreak of the disease initially.
The European Regional Office for Hospitals and Primary Care Centres of the ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines for removing multi-level sources, including increasing the focus of the laboratory on COVID-19 testing, increasing the number of intensive monitoring by isolating and keeping COVID-19 positive patients and training staff, and increasing the number of available ventilation and beds.
There are various theories as to where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
Most of these were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from one such animal; or in other words, it has animal sources. A pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a ""SARS-like coronavirus""".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were accused by the police of spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fan, was scorned by his senior staff for issuing a warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, a number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, which are subject to investigation.
In early and mid-2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, with the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan becoming a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China stated that about 140 new cases were detected in a single day, including two people from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data showed that 6174 people had already developed symptoms as of January 20, 2020. The United States had seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world as of March 26, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There was at least one case of infection in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries restrict free movement and impose border controls.
The response included some repressive measures such as quarantine (known as house arrest or lockdown orders) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; however, according to an uncertain report, the earliest case was reported on 17 November.

Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, ordering most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its response to infectious diseases to a maximum and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year's celebrations.
Shop visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
As a result, the number of shoppers in shopping centers in March fell 3343% compared to February.
Global shopping mall operators imposed additional measures, such as increasing healthcare, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global pandemic-induced recession could put 14 to 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been the case if the global pandemic had not existed.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million Chinese people lost their jobs in Wuhan during the peak of the pandemic.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are left homeless in inland areas or stranded in Hubei Province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could cause 47 million people in the United States to lose their jobs, with unemployment rates reaching 32%. In India, the lockdown left millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid a salary/salary per day) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Red Institute found that 44% of Canadian families suffer from some form of unemployment.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million German companies sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term work plan known as the Kurtzerbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, with the impact of both corporate activities and individuals - both professional and individual - worldwide.
Institutions in the arts and culture field tried to maintain their own (often government-funded) missions to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, to maintain the safety of their workers and the public, and to collaborate with artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and on various levels have been closed indefinitely by cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events and performances.
Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Holy Week, which is celebrated in Rome during the last week of the Christian Lent.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay home instead of coming on Sundays; some churches offer church services via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are holding worship without getting out of the car.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the Christian pilgrimage to St. Peter's Square being emptied, other religious orders also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas, and subsequently closed down the holy sites, and Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic was the biggest disaster on the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports competitions, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and 2019-20 NHL season, have either been cancelled or suspended.
"This outbreak has disrupted the planning for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event ""will not occur after the summer of 2021 if rescheduled to any date after 2020"." Worldwide casinos and other gaming venues are closed and live poker tournaments have either been suspended or canceled".
Reports of a significant increase in new sign-ups on gambling sites suggest that this has led to many gamblers moving online.
Many major theaters, like those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live events, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" so artists could perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online, the coronavirus-themed countless internet memes have spread that are both ridiculous and take the spotlight from this uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a rise in prejudice, fear of foreigners and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and people in hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fears, doubts and hostilities have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Cases reported since February have documented racial prejudice against groups of Chinese people around the world who claim they deserve or are being treated fairly in retaliation for the virus.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei said they were discriminated against based on regional diversity.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and there was support for people in the virus-affected areas.
People in Italy who have experienced the terrible experience of COVID-19 outbreak as the first country in Europe as the outbreak progresses in new hotspot countries may be subject to suspicion and fear from abroad.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseRussianJapanAskDon't be surprised became very popular.
The incidence of racial abuse and attacks against Chinese and other Asians in the UK and the US is reported to be on the rise.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"", as critics consider the phrase racist and anti-Chinese".
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian residents and returnees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzheri.
Students from North East India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major cities in India have reportedly been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Delip Ghosh, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and ""that is why God has taken revenge against them"".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata has sharply criticized the comments in Kolkata, calling them "misguided". Xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China have increased during the pandemic.
There are other newspapers including Paywall that have removed them from their partial or full coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have produced scientific papers related to outbreaks that are available in open access.
Some scientists are keen to quickly publish their findings on some innovative servers such as BioRX.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and is designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (cerology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests showed how many people had the disease, including people who had very few or no symptoms to report.
The results of this test can determine an accurate mortality rate and group immunity among the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the outbreak among its population as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in how many tests have been done across countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported case mortality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or tissue samples, can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a throat swab is reliable only in the first week of illness.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, but the number in the lungs may continue to increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material may be taken from the deepest of the respiratory tract by suction catheters, or the excretion (spoon) with coughing can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at Charité, Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical phase PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the common ""E"" gene and the RdRp gene that characterizes SARS-CoV-2 in all beta coronaviruses. BGI Group in China was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR panels to public health labs in real-time through international reagent resources".
Unresolved results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests of older versions of test kits and resulted in a test barrier at CDC in Atlanta; resulting in an average of less than 100 samples successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two materials were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing must be carried out as required by the CDC.
The COVID-19 test in Russia was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infections. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in greater quantities in 3.5 hours, thus allowing a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization ( EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a trial on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously granted similar approvals to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can yield positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S., and Abbott expects to increase production to deliver 50,000 tests per day. One test uses a monoclonal antibody, which is tightly bound to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus, and is being prepared in Taiwan in the hope that it will yield results in 15 to 20 minutes, just like a fast flu test.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of chest radiographs in the early stages is very low in diagnosis, but may be present in data from CT [computed tomography] even before symptoms begin"".
The CT features include a two-sided, multi-lober ground-glass optical efficiency with an edge, unobtrusive and backward distribution.
The onset of the disease is accompanied by subpleural dominance, madness, and consolidation.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current epicenter, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and many of its imaging features are consistent with other processes of pneumonia and disease.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 screening or diagnosis"". As of March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection in humans, determine immunity and monitor the population from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Evaluations can be performed by point-of-care testing (PoCT) in central laboratories (CLT) and in service areas.
Many essential laboratories will have high-performance automated systems capable of performing this as, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single sample of endogenous blood is commonly used for CLT, although sequential samples may also be used to track immune response.
A single blood sample is usually taken by puncturing the skin for PoCT.
A pre-acquisition step is not required for testing like the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 institutions that provided the agency with notices as needed and are now able to deliver their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test's capacity is hundreds of samples in a matter of hours, and so it's much faster than traditional PCR evaluation of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK learned that no antibody test kits purchased were good enough to use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme whereby the suspicious patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, return it and get the test results shortly afterwards. The British NHS has announced that they are launching a scheme on a trial basis to test for suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection by the patient to other people when a patient is hospitalized, or eliminates the need to disinfect him if an ambulance is used.
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea to conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country. The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that their operating settings have the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day and 10,700 people were tested the previous week.
When the test is prescribed by a doctor, health insurance pays the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, the drive-in test was given in many major cities.
The total number of tests performed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12/2020 as of the calendar week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) in the trial were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2". Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a methodology by combining samples from 64 patients to test together, and further tested only if the combined sample was found to be positive.
Modeling overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in 5 days showed that if the test capacity was not increased in time, the incidence would be 47% higher for Huawei and the associated cost of quarantine would be doubled.
Huo-Yan labs in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory.
The test capacity was 50,000 per day as of 4 March 2020. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays have been released that can test a maximum of 1122 patients for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
In March, the lack of reagents and insufficient amounts became a limitation on mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to explore the sampling preparation protocol where the samples were heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more populations for the coronavirus than any other country and is on track to increase testing levels to reach the majority of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-through capabilities and a population-scale mass-purchase of production laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first such lab in the world to operate outside China.
Different testing systems were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization adopted the German system of kits to be sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce their own kits.
The system was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which delayed trials available in the U.S. Early in the outbreak of the disease, problems arose between China and the United States about the reliability of test kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits for testing to meet demand and recommendations by German and health experts.
Experts say that the large number of tests in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has developed the ability to test in private sector labs for several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to widespread infection of the virus has created a backlog of millions of testing jobs in private US labs, and pressures on supply of soaps and chemical disruptors.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
"The test kits prepared by the CDC in the United States were ""errors""; the administration then removed the regulatory barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be false".
The company explained that incorrect results may result from failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would withdraw the wrongly tested kits, and replace them with a different one provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic had received 80% of the wrong results of the test kits it had purchased from China.
Prime Minister Matovič proposed to dump them in the Danube River. Ates Kara, Turkish Health Ministry, said that the test kits Turkey purchased from China had "high rates of defects" and they "did not use them". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
The results were positive as a result of testing and quarantine of those who tested positive and finding out who had contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two phases of testing on a full population of 3,400 people over a period of about ten days.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all identified people were quarantined.
The new infections have been completely eliminated by the regulation of commuter traffic.
With no extreme controls like aggressive tracking, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but with no enforced closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 in time after a holiday break.
Several other countries have managed to control the global pandemic with aggressive tracking, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more than the death toll had much lower death rates, because they were likely able to identify patients who were mild or symptom-free.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the testing capacity and have limited experience in national laboratories on COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for testing confirming COVID-19.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
"The column ""How many percent of tests are positive"" in the chart below is influenced by the test policy of that country".
In a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the positive percentage is higher than in a country where all citizens are tested, whether they have symptoms or not, even if everything else is the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the act of cleaning a person's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap at specific ""critical moments"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the vagus".
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., the salivary gland).
The five important moments of the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after the garbage disposal, after the baby's nappies are cleaned or changed, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after cooking or handing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If there is no water and soap, you can wash your hands with soap.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the baby toilet that used to be cleaned.
After your nose is flushed, coughed, or dizzy.
After touching animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the healthier practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands clean of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and of harmful or disease-causing chemicals.
It is especially important for people who care for or work in the medical field, but it is also an important method for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing infection with influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reducing infant and death rates during home delivery.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing habits may lead to a decreased growth in height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap can reduce child mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple process can reduce the mortality rate from this disease by about 50%.
Handwashing incentives can reduce the period of diarrhea by about a third, and are comparable to clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap has been linked to a 48% reduction in diarrhea cases. The only effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) is by hand washing with soap as an automatic practice in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age. It kills an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the co-cause of about 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, changing to a strong habit of washing hands with soap before and after eating can save more lives than a single vaccine or medical intervention, cut deaths from diarrhea by about half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing protects against infectious skin diseases (impetigo) that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to dizziness, a condition known as hand acne or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare professionals.
Excessive hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five important times of the day when hand washing is important to reduce the infection of the mouth and mouth are: after using the bathroom (sandwiches, garbage), after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating and before/ after cooking or putting hands on raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent infection include before and after cutting or wounding; after dizziness, coughing, or rinsing the nose; after touching animal waste or moving animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is very rare.
A 2015 survey of 54 countries found that 38.7% of households were used to hand washing with soap. A 2014 survey found that the rate in Saudi Arabia was highest at 97 percent; the United States was about 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several days of practice change systems now exist to increase hand washing with soap in times of crisis.
"The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of adequate measures to promote children's health and education".
The main focus of this programme is to make sure that the worms are watered twice a year, and that the hands are washed with soap and flushed with fluoride every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water increases the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solubility and increase solubility.
Only water is an ineffective skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are organic soil constituents, are not easily dissolved in water.
The purification is necessarily done by means of moderate water flow.
Nireet soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that aimed at transferring bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the chances of transfer are low because bacteria are washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that ""fluid soap that can be controlled without the use of hands is recommended""".
There has been a lot of publicity about the antibacterial soap.
There is no evidence to date of the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for antibiotic-resistant organisms of nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which have a high degree of resistance to organisms.
So, while antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to serfacents and skin-protective ingredients, sophisticated preparations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and additional skin conditioners (alovera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common effects such as triclonazole-based antibacterial soaps are associated with disease prevention and removal of bacteria from the hand.
Relaxing hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water in eliminating the natural oil that retains soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to what Leakey believes, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is not water-based is a hand-cleaning material.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol rubber (also known as alcohol-based rubber, antiseptic hand rubber, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity as a hand sanitizer.
Isopropyl is mostly made from alcohol or ethanol, prepared by combining gel carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) or moisturizer with a thick substance such as glycerin in liquid or foam to reduce the usability and drying effect of alcohol.
Adding the combined hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol that is effective at killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multivitamins resistant to drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubber sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equal to 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application in the hand and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of application in the hand. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and relatively less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or norovac) type of virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The liquid, foam or gel is rubbed on the front and back of both hands and the middle and the last fingers for about 30 seconds until it dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you wash your hands thoroughly with hand sanitizer rub, especially if you have dirty hands.
The increasing use of these ingredients depends on their ease of use and rapid destruction of the microbial organism; although they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
If the formula does not contain emollients and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softening ingredients caused significantly less stress and dryness on the skin than soaps or disinfectant detergents.
Hypersensitivity to allergic skin conditions, exposure to pathogens, or to substances present in alcohol or alcohol rarely occurs in alcohol hand rub.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower incidence of initiating painful contact dermatitis became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless materials do not clean the hand's organic matter, but only disinfect the hand.
Since pathogens remain in the hands, soap and water are not as effective as effective hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and preparation and in the past cases alcohol and alcohol rubber have performed significantly less than they did.
Most recently, benzalkonium chloride user preparation has been shown to maintain a stable and enhanced antimicrobial activity unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease efficacy after repeated use due to a likely progressive adverse skin reaction.
In low-income societies, many people do not have the financial support to buy soap and instead use soap or soil.
Soil or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or soil is contaminated by germs, it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, soybeans are a disinfectant because they produce alkaline solutions when exposed to water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends soap or sand as a substitute for soap.
Proper hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for Disease Control include the following steps:
Wet your hands in hot or cold running water.
Water is recommended because permanent basins can be polluted, but water temperature does not appear to make any difference.
Rub the soap foam in the back of your hands, in your fingers and under your nails with sufficient soap.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
During scrubbing, there is friction that removes germs from the skin and further germs are removed when rubbed for a long time.
Wash well in the stream.
Hands washed in the basin can re-contaminate.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-polluted. The areas most frequently left out are the fingers, wrists, between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nail polish and knitted needle polish can provide shelter for the parasite.
Moisturizing solutions are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be made for hand washing facilities, for example pouring water from suspended jarries or suitable perforated lava and/or using sawdust if necessary. In conditions of limited water supply (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving surfaces and other low-cost options such as ""TP-taps""".
Tippi-tap is a simple technique where a leg-driven liver and a piece of soap are used to pour a jug of water suspended by rope and a small amount of water into the hand.
Well-dried hands are an essential part of the hand sanitization process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of public bathroom drying.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than many electric hand dryers found in the bathroom.
A study was produced by the Paper Towel Industry European Tissue Symposium in 2008 and conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms of the hands.
Drying with jet-air dryers increases the total number of bacteria in the fingers by an average of 42% and the palms by 15%.
After hand-drying with a paper towel after washing, the total bacterial incidence decreases by an average of 76% on the fingers and 77% on the palms. The scientists also conducted tests to prove whether the resulting drying method had the potential for contamination (crush-contamination) from other bathroom users and the space of the bathroom environment.
The jet-air dryer, which exudes air at a maintained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of detonating germs from the hands and units and eliminating potential contamination of bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 m.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads the antimicrobial organism to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms. A 2005 study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated the methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria have been observed after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryers are available and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing is an alternative to using hand sanitizing wipes when traveling due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory in hospital settings long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered (1846) the effectiveness of hand washing in preventing disease.
There are some electronic devices that hospital staff feed back to remind them that they forgot to wash their hands.
One study found that using them reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds and with sufficient soap and water or gel to rub the foam into each part of the hand.
Fingers should be tied together and hands rubbed together.
A bristle brush can be used to remove dirt under the nail.
Since germs can be present in hand water, it is important to wash the foam well and wipe it dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water tap (and open another door to exit if necessary).
This prevents further contamination of the hands from those surfaces.
"Hand washing in healthcare settings is intended to remove disease-causing germs and prevent their transmission".
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most medical settings, the shortage of hand washing remains unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, thus causing infection.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper on the standard hand washing and hand rubbing in the Department of Health Care.
The draft manual on hand hygiene by the organization for public comment can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance verification is required.
The World Health Organization has "five moments" for hand washing:
- After the blood comes into contact with the body fluid.
Before the disease-free work, and
"Anti-sepsis chemical additives in soap ("medicated" or "antibacterial" soap) provide the ability to destroy hand washing agents".
The death action may be induced before surgery or in areas where antibiotic-resistant organisms are present. For surgical work, it is necessary to have a hand 'screw' for your hands that can be turned on and off without touching by hand, some chlorhexidine or iodine washing, disinfecting towels to dry hands after washing, and brushing for scraping and other disinfecting devices to clean underneath the nails.
All the jewelry must be unlocked.
This procedure usually requires washing up to 2-6 minutes of hands and elbows.
Hand rubbing for long periods (10 minutes) is not necessary.
During washing, water from the palm to the elbow must be prevented from getting back into the palm.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after attending to the sick person or use hand antiseptics.
For the control of Staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing was from the first 20% washing and the additional benefit was found to be very low when the repetition of hand washing was increased to 35%.
Comparing hand-washing with antibacterial soap over a 30-second interval with alcohol-based spraying, each showed that rubbing with alkali reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water/water are more effective at reducing the seeds of H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile from the hand than alcohol-based hand rub. Hand washing, alcohol-based hand rub to improve hand hygiene in healthcare environments may involve the education of staff and the provision of written and oral reminders to staff on the availability of alcohol-based hand rub.
Further research is needed on which of these improvements are most effective in different healthcare environments.
Hand washing with soap is recognized in developing countries as a cost-effective, essential way to achieve good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to achieving universal hand washing practices.
For example, in most rural Africa, there are cheap options for building handwashing facilities, but there are very few handwashing taps near every private or public toilet.
However, low hand washing rates can be due to deep-rooted habits rather than lack of soap or water/water.
Promoting and advising hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to a change in people's long-term habits.
To be effective, it needs to be monitored and evaluated.
"A regular review of 70 studies found that community-based practices at LMIC are effective in handwashing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of handwashing campaigns in schools is UNICEF's ""three-star approach"" which encourages schools to take simple, affordable steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health needs".
When the minimum score is achieved, schools can reach a three-star rating from one to the end.
The installation of hand washing stations can be part of the hand washing campaign that is being conducted to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to raise awareness of handwashing that is trying to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
DALYs have considered several studies on the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries on prevention.
However, one review reports that hand washing with soap is relatively more affordable than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing to human health  especially for people in unsafe situations, such as hospital mothers who have given birth to newborns or wounded soldiers - two pioneers of hand hygiene recognized it in the first half of the 19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English ""founder of modern nursing""".
Up until that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miasma.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne illness and health care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from this type of infectious disease.
"For example, in Germany posters with ""right hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and near the hand washing sinks of office buildings and airport toilets".
"The phrase "to wash one's hands" means to express one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the matter or to be a partaker of the evil".
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate refused to crucify Jesus Christ, but by more widespread use in some English communities it has become a language expression.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands in an attempt to clear the fanciful stains by revealing her guilt over the crimes she committed and the incitement to crime that had led to her husband.
It has also been found that people, when thinking about or thinking about immoral activities, tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value hand washing tools more.
"Moreover, those who have been hand-washed after such intentions are less likely to engage in other 'cleaning up' compensatory activities such as volunteering".
Hand washing is a part of religious practices characterized by many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tevilá and Nethillat Yadīmi in Judaism, Lawabō in Christianity, and Ozu in Islam. Religions especially instruct healthy hand washing after doing some work.
Hand washing is obligatory in Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions after using the toilet.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is obligatory before and after meals.
Workplace risk control for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and work to be done, a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of disease in the public community, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be at risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues, with general prevention measures recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, breathing manners, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but where frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected in the workplace due to an ongoing disease spread among the public or due to international travel is required.
This includes workers with public connections, such as schools, high-density work environments, and some overcrowded retailers.
In addition to the initial infection prevention measures, the disaster control system for this group includes ventilation, sniffguards and personal protective equipment for COVID-19 infected persons using advanced capacity air filters.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and people working in the field at high risk of being exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections. This risk is increased if these workers implement aerosol-generating process or collect or sample any confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections through this process.
These risk controls appropriate for personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure air circulation chambers, and personal protective equipment suitable for job work.
The COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace can have many effects.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, to care for others, or for fear of potential exposure.
The way in which goods are in demand and the way in which they are purchased (such as shopping in non-business hours or through delivery or drive-through services (not from the car), can change the nature of the business in both directions.
Finally, shipments from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address various workplace and workplace-related risk levels, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and personal risk factors for employees such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outlined the necessary controls to address those risks and plans to be prepared for the situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing infections among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and reducing adverse impacts on other organizations in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located influences the responses received.
The risk management framework is a framework that is widely used in controlling occupational safety and health performance.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, then administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and this could be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work-related policies or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control but may help prevent some exposure.
All PPE types must be selected at the risk of the employee, as appropriate as applicable, fit (such as respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced, and properly opened, cleaned and stored or cancelled to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a low risk of exposure are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
Basic measures recommended for the workplace to prevent infection include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when ill, providing breathing habits including face covering during coughs and coughs, providing tissue and garbage disposal, being prepared for telecommunications or staggered shifts if necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining a clean and disinfected work environment.
A vital step in keeping employees, customers, interviewers and others safe at work is to quickly identify and isolate potentially infected persons.
All employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory illness are advised by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, and should be flexible with sick leave policies, which allow employees to stay home to care for an ill family member, and staff should be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at moderate exposure risk include those where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within six feet (1.8 m) of the density or close exposure to people who may have been infected by an ongoing disease spreading among the public in a business location or who have recently travelled internationally to a place where COVID-19 has spread widely.
This includes engineering controls for high-performance air filters for and for high-risk groups, increasing ventilation rates, setting physical barriers such as clean plastic snipe guards, and setting up a drive-through window for customer service. This includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, providing training to people who are exposed to COVID-19 and providing them with regular training on how to use COVID-19 after the onset of the shift, providing access to safe and secure workplaces, identifying and providing access to safe and secure workplaces, providing access to safe and secure workplaces, providing access to safe and secure workplaces, providing access to safe and secure workplaces, and other necessary measures to prevent COVID-19 from occurring, and eliminating the need for personal and occupational safety, identifying and protecting the environment and the risks of exposure to face-to-face meetings, and providing training to people who are exposed to COVID-19 and other factors that may affect the safety of their workplace.
Rarely, workers in this risk group need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, appropriate controls to protect personnel and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a staff member to serve the sick person, and providing a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his or her face and nose with tissue during diarrhea or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to a call from an ill passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and additional personal protective equipment should be used if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
For commercial vessels, including pleasure craft and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying travel if ill, keeping yourself isolated, and informing the ship's medical center immediately if someone experiences fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be in the quarantine cabin of the person who has been isolated. In the case of school and childcare facilities, regardless of the public transmission of the disease, the CDC recommends temporary closures if an infected person enters the school building for cleaning or disinfection.
When disease spreads to a minimum to a moderate extent in public society, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, rallies and other large gatherings, such as physical education or eating in a group music class or cafeteria; increasing distance between desks, separating office and holiday times, limiting unnecessary meeting attendance, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When the disease is rampant in local communities, social distancing strategies may be considered to further increase school dropouts. The health risks of law enforcement personnel performing traditional daily activities are considered low by the CDC.
All law enforcement officials who need to contact people who are confirmed to have or suspect COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If workers come into close contact during the time of alarm, their duty belts and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wipes before reuse, and evidence management procedures should be followed to control and dispose of used PPE.
OSHA considers certain health care and death services personnel to be in a high or ultra-high risk category of exposure.
High-risk jobs of exposure include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who come into contact with patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If staff perform aerosol-producing procedures, or collect or move samples from patients known or suspected of COVID-19, they become at high risk of exposure.
Aerosol-producing procedures include tube insertion, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and sampling by inserting tests or materials.
High-risk, death related jobs include staff who were involved in preparing the bodies of people known to have or suspected COVID-19 at the time of death; this is a very high risk of exposure if they perform a vaginal surgery.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable for some healthcare and spa environments.
Samples should be handled according to the Biosafety Level 3 warnings.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated into separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected of COVID-19. OSHA recommends respirators in addition to other PPE for people who are known or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 working within 6 feet and for people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
NIOSH-approved N95 or better filtered facial respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program, including health testing, training, and medical examinations in the United States.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covertall, as COVID-19 does not spread through physical fluids, but rather is a respiratory disease.
WHO recommends a surgical mask only for screening staff at the entrance.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gowns and gloves for those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing method.
If an aerosol-producing process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the inadequacy of PPE supply globally, WHO is recommending the use of physical intervals such as telemedicine, transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and allowing only those directly involved in the care work to enter a room with a single COVID-19 patient, using only PPE needed for specific purposes, continuing to use the respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, allowing monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of PPE, and encouraging people without symptoms to wear masks.

Subject: [Covid-19] Lifting the load and preparing for the future
Date and time of delivery: 14th March 2020, 00:24 UTC

We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The global COVID-19 pandemic is an event that clarifies global human interconnections and our responsibilities to one another.
We have no precedent for these challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the global compassion, cooperation and community building at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust and care we have seen in all our colleagues through email, calls and chats is a remarkable testament to the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared their praise for our work with me.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to see Wikipedia at this moment and how powerful it is to have this important resource online and available to everyone.
Your job makes it possible, whether you run the sites or pay our colleagues or keep our communities safe, whatever you do.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now on a much larger scale than ever.
It's a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes in the way we work together from this coming week.
We are not alone in our efforts to make a difference.
Like Robin mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought it was the right response to the situation we were facing, and we discussed in that conversation the best way to keep the company going at the moment.
Most of us wanted to relieve the stress and support our cause for the long term.
If you need to back up the dial, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contracted employees:
Until further notice, our daily work expectations will be about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work at more normal times, the mission can get you on board.
But at this uncertain moment, whether you need to take care of your loved one, or bring grocery items or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not keeping track of your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
It's not necessary, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team adjust calendars and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can help and ensure that your situation gets proper attention from the authorities).
Full pay will be paid to hourly workers.
We have already said, and we again pledge to honor our commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes, if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people use work as a way to drive their stress from the world around us to a particular direction.
What we do can be incredibly productive, especially at times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to stay in touch with your manager so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all our departments to assess the current objectives and shift our focus to cooperate with what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we all focus on the most important projects.
Slow down now, you won't get hurt later.
We do not plan to work twice as long to feed after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to finish work on time, which is not realistic anymore.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new targets and deadlines.
What happens to the APP?
To match our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we also want to adjust the timeline for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which gives employees more time to prepare budgets to prioritize essential work, to give them the opportunity to take care of themselves and their loved ones, while also meeting the demands of those who want or need to work on reduced schedules for the next few weeks.
This extension of time limits greatly reduces the workload of the current plan and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and we will update the delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
I would like to thank the APP team for their leadership in this regard.
The office condition, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to COVID-19.
But with great caution, we hired a team of antivirus cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect every surface and lobby and the elevator banks that entered our floors.
The building is employing its own service responsibility protocol user products that help their tenants to be safe.
We feel relieved that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has exchanged its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Our DC office moved to a fully remote setup last week in line with San Francisco's directions.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a place in Brooklyn.
The talks are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote colleagues know this can be a compromise, and they wanted to give you some advice:
If the length of the meeting is too long, limit it to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to break them down into smaller sections over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, set a schedule, and send the material ahead of time.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom, make video by default to make live collaboration and connectivity easier.
Have a lead to facilitate each meeting, ask someone to monitor the chat questions and to monitor the speaker list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your wellness remembrance for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distribution.
The HR Executive Team is looking at webinar-based argonomics guidance to help increase distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community donors to cancel public events like the Wikimedia-funded Editathan until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying these goals.
This coming week we will inspire additional guidance for Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
There seems to be a general depression about the disruption of the global public, but at the same time, Wikimedia and elsewhere, seem to have both the ability to focus on their own public and the lack of clarity.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on the Meta-Wiki, to provide a space for the public to monitor the impact and follow up on our interactions with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
In this situation, we are all united and we will help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and find other essential information about COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please do not hesitate to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide assistance and coordination as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a dismissal of our work and responsibility.
Rather, it is a recognition that we may have to adapt to our tasks and responsibilities now in a way that we have not in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need for our mobility, and provide the services that the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Now is the time to help each other and make room for the important work that is coming in the weeks and perhaps even months ahead.
We need your cooperation to do this, and we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be healthy when needed.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hyme V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hyme V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B2Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a secretory enzyme that binds to the outer layer of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells (cellular membranes).
ACE2 counteracts the work of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing its Ang1-7 to make it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting catalyst 2 is a zinc-binding metallogenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and a C-terminal colectin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose excitatory activity is uncovered on the surface of lung and other tissue cells.
The outer domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shades, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the membrane of lung type II alveolus-related cells, small intestinal enterocytes, mostly arterial and vascular endothelial cells, and the splenic muscle cells of the arteries.
ACE2 mRNA expression has also been found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothylamus, and brainstorm.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterbalance.
ACE angiotensin I divides the hormone into vasoconsisting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxylic-terminal amino acid phenylalanine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) from angiotensin II and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can differentiate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin.
ACE2 neutralizes the membrane exchange of the amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the key entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the surface of the cell in the enzyme domain of ACE2 results in the displacement of both endocytosis and the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes located within the cell.
This entry process also requires priming of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently under investigation as a potential healer. This has helped some speculate that decreasing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared to controls, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia".""
"In addition, ""the risk of pneumonia was also reduced among patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially those at high risk of pneumonia, and those with stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in the mortality rate associated with pneumonia, although its effects were less potent than those of the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered an innovative therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve the pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation of piglets, including symptoms of lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, while the duration of effect (stability) is 24 hours.
Various studies suggest that rhACE2 may be expected in individuals who cannot tolerate a class 1 renin-angiotensin system inhibitor or inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or who have a disease where angiotensin II transportation is increased.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to identify contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person who is in contact with an infected person (""contact"")".
Numerous applications were developed or proposed in several regions and jurisdictions with official government assistance.
Several infrastructure have been developed for the development of contact identification apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially with regard to systems that operate on the basis of geolocation of app users.
Relatively unauthorized access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user capture and hold on to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app in conjunction with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities.
The app was developed by the local IT group, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched Stop Coronavirus! a Bluetooth-based app to detect symptoms of potential infections and provide prompt response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store from 14 April 2020.
"On 12 April, the government announced that the Connection Tracking app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available to work within a few weeks. Similar apps (""StopCovid"") are planned in Ireland and France".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is considering launching a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor in the Department of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including the lack of functionality when the app is fallible positive and the acceptance of the app is limited to a small segment of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its app store, restricting them to only ""government"" or otherwise reputable companies".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed their concerns about the implications of surveillance of the public using coronavirus apps, particularly as to whether surveillance infrastructure designed to cope with the global coronavirus pandemic will be completed once the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The agency announced eight conditions regarding the government project:
"The observer must be "legally, necessary and proportionate".
Sunset should be in order to increase monitoring and surveillance;
Data use for COVID-19 purposes should be restricted;
Protect information security and anonymity and demonstrate evidence-based protection;
Digital surveillance was needed to stop the spread of discrimination and marginalization;
The sharing of any data with third parties must be specified by law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"Important participation will be required from all ""relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginal groups". The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohen Greinen) (RSF) have released a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to remove tracing processes from the operating systems of their devices and resolve fixed monitoring problems if they no longer require tracing.
Some countries have used network-based location monitoring instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location information have significant potential privacy issues.
However, all central server systems do not require access to private location data; multiple privacy storage systems have been developed that use central servers only for interconnection (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea for contact monitoring.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to send notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn of potential contacts, the government has made location information available to the public, allowing for some things due to far-reaching changes in the Privacy Act following the outbreak of MERS in the country.
The information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been released.
It is a well-established concept to identify privacy-protected communications with a practical component of research education that dates back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording proximity to another cellphone user using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized codes of conduct include decentralized privacy-protected proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive codes of conduct and processes for mobile communication detection (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and all matching occurs within the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protection strategies when collecting and using location or route intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a white paper called Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort is by Enigma MPC, a security technology maker based in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials without compromising on the privacy of their information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was established by a group of groups aimed at reducing fragmentation and enabling universal interoperability to identify and alert apps, which is a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it has an open-source BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to track people who are exposed to privacy as they claim, which works on the basis of a blend of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also released details of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three steps:
To enable governments to create official apps that protect privacy to detect coronavirus, roll-out tools
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android: Google and Apple plan to solve the take-up and continuous monitoring problems by first delivering the system via operating system updates and then removing it in the same manner in the event of a disaster.
A drug repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-purpose, new-functioning or reliever drug) is an approved drug used to treat a disease or disorder that is different from the one originally developed for.
It is a path of scientific research that is currently being followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convex plasma infection. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-specific proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
These binding sites provide a reasonable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papine protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helix, S protein and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussain A. A., and others conducted a variety of candidate compound studies that were optimized and analyzed in his pre-clinical research for the skeletal similarity of candidates with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful SARS-CoV-2 antibody to suggest clinical study design.
Chlorokine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorokine and its related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity diagnostic trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chlorine and hydroxychloroquine in New York State would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial procedure and is only approved as an experimental treatment for emergency use by patients who are hospitalized but are unable to participate in clinical trials under the European Union.
"The CDC said that ""the use, dosage or stability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been proven".
"Doctors say they are using the drug because there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokoin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
There is a large scale of research at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Faviparavir was ""clearly effective"".
In the middle of four days, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, while 45 patients who did not get it had a long illness of 11 days.
In a study of 240 pneumonia patients in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half were given umfenovir.

It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
"A study of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonovir antiviral drugs, concluded that ""no benefits were observed""".
Medicines were planned to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change drugs to find a compound that would bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism in the scientific community about using resources to change the purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO includes Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the international mutual support trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity against multiple phylloxera, pneumonia, paramycoccus, and coronaviruses in vitro.
One problem with antiviral treatment is that it causes immunity to develop through mutations that can lead to more serious illness and infection.
Several diagnostic trials are underway, including two trials conducted by the Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with extra-severe illness.
Vitamin C has three ongoing clinical trials for hospitalization and care for seriously ill people with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a diagnostic trial for the respiratory corticosteroid Alvesco (Cycliconide) in Taizhin to treat pre-diagnosed patients with novel coronavirus.
A type of test for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients receiving serious, hospitalized treatment to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is taking 6000 adults aged 40 years and over who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective method of contraception, are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
The widespread use of low molecular weight heparin for the treatment of patients has prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centric study on the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and sedative doses on 300 patients was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, so traditionally scientific attention has been focused on the re-engineering of approved anti-toxic drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Raibavirin: Raibavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines.
Umfenovir: Umfenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially novel for use as a treatment for COVID-19 include:
Tosilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Testing is also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed its diagnostic tests, multiple efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that they did not expect the effective vaccine against the virus, SARS-CoV-2, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in the Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many companies are using the published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI said that the condition for the vaccine initiative is speed, production capacity, large scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were working towards research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Key platform targets that have been advanced to Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developing phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Carrier of the virus (developer and vaccine candidate phase I: Cancino Biology, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 total vaccinated individuals are in the early stages of improvement, 78 of whom have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others, but all of these are derived from information that has been little released to the public (presumably planned).
Phase I-II testing conducts preliminary safety and immunity tests and is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multiple sites when more specific, effective dosage is scheduled.
Phase III trials, including vaccine testing for disease prevention and control groups, typically involve more participants, while monitoring adverse effects at favorable doses.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been human evaluated (yet under ""preliminary"" study)".
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecularly bound vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to trigger immune responses.
In Canada, around January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-Intervac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it will begin work on a vaccine with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies led by Hanneke Schuitemaker announced that they had started work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing the Seva vaccine together with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergency BioSolutions announced a partnership in manufacturing with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, Oncogene Laboratories in Romania published a brief essay on the design of a vaccine using the same technology used for the treatment of cancer with neonogen vaccination.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, Generex subsidiary, NewGenerex Immunology-Oncology announced that they were launching a vaccine project to develop an AI-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to create a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced their plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detroit and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in Western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On 10th March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has joined Novavax Inc.
In the development and production of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health, Government of India announced that it is working on 11 isolates and that it will take at least 1.5 to 2 years to develop a vaccine at a fast pace.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like molecules partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Medicare.
The vaccine is undergoing candidate laboratory trials with plans to be tested in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered Currievac 'big money' to get a COVID-19 vaccine exclusive, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Candidate for mRNA-based vaccine BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical trials, and diagnostic trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotech company called Takis Biotech announced that they will have the results of pre-diagnostic trials in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate may be tested in human bodies in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced US$4.9 million investment in a research association for COVID-19 vaccines, which combined included Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI to develop COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started six different vaccine candidate trials on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were preparing a self-developing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical immunity against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities such as the University of Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of COVID-19 vaccines and plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" for several new vaccines that can be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced a trial of a potential COVID-19 vaccine called PittCoVacc on mice, stating that ""MNA-derived SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines had a strong antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that is evident early in the 2nd week after vaccination".""
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
DNA will be designed using bacteriophages to create replicas inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, in conjunction with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google's cloud computing company, created an integrated resource for the U.S. government, industry, and three universities to gain access to supercomputers from IBM.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
4,170 healthcare workers are being registered for an additional randomized trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that the vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research evaluating the efficacy of vaccines in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and mammals other than humans indicates the need for biosecurity-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure standardised protection practices for the management of living viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world.
When MERS emerged, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical trials in humans and three more are underway, all of them viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts relate to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although mild symptoms are common, some cases may lead to progression of viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread to humans primarily during close contact, often through small tongue particles caused by coughing, sneezing or talking.
When the particles of the spleen are produced during inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than spread over long distances.
People can become infected by touching their eyes, nose or face after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive up to 72 hours on the surface.
It is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms begin, although it is likely to spread before symptoms appear and during the later stages of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab.
Those suspected of being infected with the virus and their cleaners are advised to wear masks.
The general public's recommendations for wearing masks vary, some authorities are recommending against their use, some are recommending their use, and others are requiring their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
In most countries, local infections have been recorded across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be symptomless or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty waking up and bleeding of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Relatively uncommon, upper respiratory symptoms such as dizziness, nosebleeds or sore throat may occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed with a percentage variation.
In China, some cases were initially only seen with chest pains and chest pains.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-organ degeneration and death.
It's called the bacterial growth stage.
The onset of COVID-19 usually lasts five to six days but can last from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms will be seen within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that no symptoms occur in all those infected.
The role of these symptomless carriers in infection is not yet fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may play a role in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected with no symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, according to a report by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 20% of all confirmed cases were symptomless while in hospital.
On April 1, China's National Health Commission began to include symptomless cases among its daily cases; 130 (78%) of 166 cases were symptomless at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry a higher number of viruses.
Speaking out loud is more than normal.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without a mask can spread small droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and tested positive for viral RNA, an air collector placed in the hallway outside a person's home.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can result in respiratory emissions becoming airborne particles and resulting in airborne spread.
The risk is considered low, although there is concern that it may spread through the urine. The virus is most contagious when symptoms occur in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms become apparent, but the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person typically infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus was detectable for up to one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours on 99% copper.
It varies depending on humidity and temperature.
When used properly, soaps and detergents can also be effective; soap products break down the virus's fat protection layer, disabling it, and freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (an astro-surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the middle of two days after the start of hospitalization.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the highest viral load and the second test of the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a group of patients with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All features of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature among related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in domestic soaps, which rupture its protective bubble.
The lungs are the most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the nutrient cells through a large amount of the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) found in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 to enter the mammalian cell".
Severe cardiac arrests were reported in 12% of the infected people admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, and are more common in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory responses and disorders of the immune system during the development of the disease is higher, but severe myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors of the heart.
ACE2 receptors travel rapidly to the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
In ICU patients with COVID-19 infection, thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found and may be associated with poor prognosis. In the autopsy of COVID-19 deaths, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory inflorated lymphocytes were found to be damaged in the lungs.
While SARS-COV-2 tends to move towards the respiratory tract connecting epithelial cells -ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-deleted monocytes and resumption (recruitment) of severe pulmonary pathology.
The autopsy revealed lymphocytic infiltrate.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by the nosopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or lip sample may also be used.
Results are usually obtained within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but they require two blood samples taken every two weeks and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strains of the coronavirus and release genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and determine whether a person has been infected in the past) were in the works, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience in testing has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On March 21, 2020, the FDA approved the first spatial screening test for use later that month in the United States. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend infection detection methods based on diagnostic characteristics and epidemic risk.
Bilateral, multi-lobar ground-glass opacity with a marginal, unorthodox and retrograde distribution is common in early infections.
Subpleural predominance, irregular peving (lobular septal filling by the filling of variable alveoli) and aggregation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little information available on the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological data from the study of the bladder are:
Macroscopy: Pluoric, pericarditis, lung consolidation (catching of water from the lungs) and pulmonary sores
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration, and intercontinental inflammation and the formation of multicellular nematodes
Severe pneumonia: Damaged dispersed alveolar discharge (DAD) with dispersed alveolar discharge.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Pneumonia sareno: organization of extracts in the alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting dam (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and practicing proper respiratory hygiene and not touching eyes, nose or face with the bare hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue during coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends wearing face coverings in public to limit the number of people infected by people with no symptoms. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce exposure to large-scale groups of infected people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until before 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as ""flatlining the curve"".
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after a runny nose, cough or dizziness.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content only when soap and water are unavailable. WHO provides two formulas for local production in places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
The antimicrobial activity in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptic""".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are driven by support services, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and other critical organ support.
CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a normal mask.
Extrakorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments may be effective in people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonology in the United States have organized medical recommendations from various organizations at the free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for initial use.
Caution should be taken to reduce the risk of viral infection, especially in healthcare environments when performing procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation that can produce aerated particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping people in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using evidence warnings, touch warnings and airborne warnings. The CDC has outlined guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
The recommended equipment are: PPE gauntlet, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirator (instead of face mask) is recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against certain organic compounds is not guaranteed for label-specific uses.
If a mask is not available, CDC recommends using homemade masks as a face cover or last resort.
Most cases do not have COVID-19 severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of some cases are severe.
The type of respiratory aid for hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors choose to keep invasive mechanical ventilation through it if available because the technique limits the spread of aerated particles over high-flow nasal cannulae. Serious events are most common in older adults (who are over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health management to deal with the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 cases that are sufficiently severe to require hospitalization.
A Chinese study found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people infected with COVID-19 in hospitals are finally admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is further complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly uncomfortable.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are required to maximize oxygen delivery, while ventilators are required to reduce the risk of associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High-dose PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
In January 2020, research into potential treatments began and several diagnostic trials of antiviral drugs are underway.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While it may take up to 2021 for new drugs to be developed, several drugs under test are already approved for other uses or are already undergoing further testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with serious illnesses.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in potential treatment efficacy and safety trials. The FDA has temporarily approved convelescent plasma as an experimental treatment where a person's life is seriously or immediately at risk.
It has not been studied for its safety and efficacy in disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to tackle the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contact' and potential risk of infection as a result using surveillance data.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-blocking if potential risks are detected, it also warns local health officials. Big data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor infected people and people in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect and enforce quarantine of persons who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telecom also distributed data on the integrated phone location to the Robert Kah Institute, a German federal government agency for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said that mobile phone operators told him that ""40% of people are walking around anyway""".
The German government hosts the 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for a global creative solution against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel ill from quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects or fear of their own infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic depression are a complete disaster for damaging people's mental health and well-being"."
Similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold, the disease may progress mildly with little or no symptoms.
In mild cases, recovery usually takes two weeks, but in severe or life-threatening cases, recovery may take three to six weeks.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a lack of data on COVID-19.
In the majority of severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly increase the severity of respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) which can cause respiratory impairment, septic shock or multi-organ impairment.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
In 6% of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19, abnormalities in blood circulation, especially prothrombin, have been identified, while abnormal renal function has been observed in 4% of this group.
In approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 there has been an increase in liver transaminosis.
According to the same report, the time between onset of symptoms and death, including hospitalization of five people, was ten days.
However, the time between hospitalization and death of the patients transferred to ICU was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the interval from the onset of early symptoms to death, with a full six to 41 day period, was 14 days.
A study by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% and for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of pulmonary samples of the urinary bladder showed diffuse alveolar damage, including the release of cellular fibromyxide in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumosite.
The image of the lungs is similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Increased cardiac arrest or troponin levels were associated with heart damage in 11.8% of reported deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had preexisting conditions.
The mortality rate from this disease varies not only due to the regional differences but also due to the systemic difficulties.
A low death rate can be overestimated by counting mild cases.
But the reality is that deaths are the result of past infections, which means that the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and are about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die.
Hong Kong hospital authorities observed a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provided effective and long-term immunity among people recovering from the disease.
The likelihood of immunity is high based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but in those cases, recovery from COVID-19 has been reported after positive test results for the coronavirus.
These incidents are feared to be due to a further deterioration of permanent infections than reinfections.
The virus is believed to be natural and has an animal origin, through spillover infection.
The exact source is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely controlled by human-to-human transmission.
A survey of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was published in The Lancet in January 2020, with the first date of onset of symptoms reported as 1 December 2019.
The first onset of symptoms was reported on 8 December 2019, according to official releases from WHO.
Several measures are commonly used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as the amount of testing, quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO specified the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the U07.2 code for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection from COVID-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death-infected ratio as of April 17, 2020 was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR) which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who died from the disease and the infection mortality rate (Infection fatality rate, IFR), which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics have no specific time frame and follow specific populations from infection to diagnosis.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione Diadetta, is a small village of 4,600 people, where 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelet, the disease spread through carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively low mortality, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified.
Furthermore, the German health system was not disrupted.
In the Netherlands, blood donors may have about 3% antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004%) of the population have been confirmed dead from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates on men and women is different.
Studies conducted in China and Italy showed higher mortality rates among men.
Men are at highest risk in their 50s, and the gap between men and women ends in their 90s.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender gap are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Gender-based immunological differences, relatively low prevalence of smoking among women and the development of co-disorders among men at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates among men such as high blood pressure.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
The US government has not been monitoring gender data of COVID-19 infections since April 2020.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease will be 'COVID-19'".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means Corona, VI is virus, D is disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or groups of people, in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of curing cataracts. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses the additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""COVID-19 responsible virus"" in public relations".
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""".
"During the early outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the ""coronavirus"" and the ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as the temporary names for the virus and disease as acute respiratory diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines on the use of viruses and disease locations.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare components such as nasal swabs and parts of ventilators.
For example, an Italian hospital was in a very urgent need for a ventilator valve when the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frame when a local new company tested the manufacturer's product and produced 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors about the source, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
It is believed that humans are capable of spreading the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of the virus being replicated in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Mutual Support Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but various companies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 clients to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether dead or inactive, aims to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body to a new infection by COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study identified an S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme.
The third technique is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for making vaccines).
Testing of trial vaccines from one of these strategies is required for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first diagnostic trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The genetic code that causes the disease is contained in the vaccine, which is not duplicated from the virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been suggested as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials have been underway since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved therapies for the treatment of malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chlorokoquine.
Most of the studies in China are being conducted to use antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir across countries are expected to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the diagnostic development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Retonavir and Lopinavir/Retonavir in combination with interferon biter.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir in March 2020.
Progress has been observed in patients receiving treatment with Remdesivis experimental medicines.
Phase III diagnostic trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chlorokine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, the pillar of research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, when recommending a dose of one gram per day, notes that double the dose can be extremely dangerous and lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians who treat people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umfenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Initial data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitasoxanoid has been recommended for further vivo studies after demonstrating a low-density elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparation of the primary spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that have prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study.
The cytokine disaster can be a complicated situation in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-rapid release properties of cytokines. After completing a small study, the National Health Commission of China included tosilizumab in its medical guidelines.
It is undergoing a Phase 2 non-contact trial at the national level in Italy after seeing positive results in people with serious illnesses.
Blood tests with serum ferritin to identify cytokine disasters mean preventing the progression of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA as an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past-related case studies for the treatment of a separate factor-induced steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome.
To date, there is no random, controlled evidence that tosillizumab is effective in treating CRS.
The vaccine-free method of inactivating immunocompromised and antibody-rich antibodies to those in need is being investigated in those who have recovered from COVID-19.
The technique was tested for SARS with unresolved results.
Viral deactivation is the anticipated process of a special approach whereby passive antibody therapy can mediate immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in the process of development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of fluid from recovered patients and can be increased to rapidly organize specific antibodies to the virus.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
