I'm just surprised.
I'm just thinking about my accent.
Just try to find him.
I'm just watching TV.
I'm keeping an account.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I'm such a lazy man.
I'm studying the piano.
I'm looking for them now.
I'm looking for you.
My hair is falling out.
I blame myself.
I'm making a movie.
I'm making a snowman.
I'm making a cocoon.

I'm not even tired.
I'm not that hot either.
I can't find the equation.
I'm not a local.
Tom isn't helping me enough.
I'm not going anywhere.

I got over the shock.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I long for him.
I'm going after him.
I'm really hungry!
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm a little bloated.
I'm trying to.
I'm not saying anything.
I'm pretty proud of that.

I'm with the man I want to be with.
I'm working in Boston now.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm concerned about your health.
I'm afraid Tom will get lost.
I'm writing my will.

You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.

I punched him in the jaw.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I underlined the word "Alice" to emphasize it.
I suggested it.
I put three teaspoons of brown sugar in your tea.
I opened my cover.
I gave up smoking on a whim.
I gave up.
I raise cattle.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read a story to Tom.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the look of your hair.
I really like wine.
I really like your website.
I really like your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It would be really nice if you kept quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize a guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is harder than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said he might come back.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw you playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister take the letter.
But I didn't see much.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do that.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is it to Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Does Dan know what he's done?
Are the composted beans calorie-dense?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see", said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I nodded.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I have to take her home.
I have to pack.
I should go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have had so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should check.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed you my room.
Is it cold out?
- Is it ready?
How far is it from here?
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or is it just me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is that true?
I put a spatula in his face.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a spell.
I slept in the gutter.
I slept on the bus.
I almost cut the sandwich.
Has Mike stopped drinking?
I smiled at myself.
Isn't that exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that a little excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this wonderful?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day cleaning the snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I ran into something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Is that a yes or a no?
Is there even a word for that?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Isn't that why you won't help him?
Isn't that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is the delivery paid for?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything in particular you'd like to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a better time to talk?
Is this the place?
Is it a real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this in English correct?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is there someone sitting here?
Is this place clear?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom is gone.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I don't know how to do that yet.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Does Tom piss you off?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm studying art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I have asthma.
I suggest you study more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm telling you to lean in.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I suspected so.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swam in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't fuck you if I was burning up and you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
It all makes sense.
It all seems so pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't have been a coincidence.
So, no, it was not.
It's not possible!
It's about you.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Never, never, never, that could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That would be nice.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
It's not a problem.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like much.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
I'm going to be all right.
That gave me an idea.
I got things to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It's up to you.
It happened too soon.
It happens.
It happens.
It's all cool.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I think about her all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to keep it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go out to eat.
I think I'm going to go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good statement.
I think I write pretty good.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I can nod.
I think I'm going to be fine.
I think I should call Tom.
I think I should have called for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it's best if I stay here for a while.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I made a mistake.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's brilliant.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom left.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
I think Tom is heartless.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom is crazy.
I think Tom is dying.
I think Tom is funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is rude.
I think Tom is hurt.
I think Tom is mean.
I think Tom is nice.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is petty.
I think Tom is a clapper.
I think Tom is rich.
I think Tom is right.
I think Tom is stuck.
I think Tom is vain.
I think Tom is sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom is going.
I think we can catch him.
I think we better not drink this water.
We better not go out in this storm.
I think we'll join you.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're ready.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what interests me.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're freaking out.
I think you're overstating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
I think you've been lied to.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should get through this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was being punished.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
So, we had a deal, right?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
I think you're gonna be busy.
So you didn't want the reward?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
So you hate him, don't you?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
So you said you could swim, right?
So, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you'd be free.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
It hurts like hell here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cup cover up.
It's a multi-step process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer that question.
There's no theoretical way I can finish the job in one day.
It's less humid today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying for it.
It's not an option.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It just seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's going to be fine.
Christmas is coming up.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's going to be fine.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
He looked funny.
You're probably right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
It looks familiar.
It looks like an egg.
I must have had too much to drink last night, my head's killing me.
Looks like these two are back together.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He called me.
It's bothering me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
He might be back tonight.
Maybe it seems weird.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it was him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to do.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna be a pain.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm in my room.
I took the bus back.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are torn.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably not worth the wait.
He was back two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulties.
I tried to explain, but he wouldn't budge.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret that.
I trust the master.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to cut myself.
He's about to turn.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster.
It is advisable to check for any adverse effects if you drink alcohol while taking your prescribed medication.
It's a child's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's over for us.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be ready in a minute.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go soon.
It's really fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's already eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
It's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false lead.
It's a risky plan.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
It's quick on foot.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They broke it.
You just gave me a hard time.
It's been raining for a week, more or less.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's been a very hot week.
You better not talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than to be a pessimist and be right.
It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees. Then why are you still alive?
It's empty.
The sauna is here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one there.
It's time to close.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's very upsetting.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
You can tell them apart easily.
I guess I misjudged him.
It's like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to whine.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's only fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
Get dressed up.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's going to be brutal.
It's going to get colder.
It's going to happen soon.
It's good to see you all again.
It's good training.
It's all right.
It's getting better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's her.
It's hot in hell here.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
It matters to me what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question of who.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little further up.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I'm the one who decides, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
It's nice to feel needed.
It's not much of a miracle.
It's not much of a miracle.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
It's not a big priority.
It's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It will not be easy to accomplish this without much help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
It's not a big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not a regular pen.
There's not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
- That's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's only a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
That sounds pretty cool.
That sounds really good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's a poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
That's probably true.
He probably still has it.
It's probably still available.
It's a hole.
It's actually quite common.
It's really good.
I may very well be wrong.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's as simple as that.
It's really exciting.
It's really gross.
It's such a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so wonderful.
It's so complicated.
That's cool.
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on the market.
It's still working.
It's still not raining.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck in the water.
Its surface was flat as a mirror.
It's about time.
This is the best scent I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
It's a powerful one.
It sucks.
It's all wrong.
It can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's not natural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's too simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm guessing without a clue.
There's a wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's your turn to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're a little unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the light.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was an honor to be asked to give the talk.
It was just wonderful.
It was a disgrace.
It was after midnight.
This has been a wild day.
It was a great show.
This whole thing was my idea.
It was fine here.
It was so easy.
That was an amazing night.
It was a sit-down.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a privilege to spend the evening with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
It was a wonderful experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a lovely evening.
That was childish of him.
It was gross.
It was effective.
That was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
He was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was getting dark.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my mistake.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It's been proven that the boils that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was just magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
Epton was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was breathing.
It was extraordinary.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was awful.
It was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the pole.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was pathetic.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unconscionable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your mistake.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be long.
I won't be alone here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
That's not gonna help you.
It's working fine.
It would be perfectly normal for you to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you now.
I used to watch you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I use this.
I already packed.
I already read it.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone to help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little busy.
I've been all over town looking for Dom.
I've been a lot worse.
I was betrayed.
I was notified.
I've been robbed three times a month.
I've been calling for hours.
I was careless.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping.
I was helping them.
They hired me to find them.
I was kidnapped.
I've lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been learning French since I was 13.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.

It's running out of gas.
It's a lot of unnecessary drama.
We're overstating it.
We're playing a computer game.
We're playing with the computer.
We're pretty good at this.
We're probably lying to ourselves.
We're ready to fight.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
We are very angry.
We're really good.
We are in real danger.
We're too sophisticated.
We're sorry about that.
We're going to stay.
We're the best.
We're playing with fate.
We are the champions.
Were there any survivors?
We are Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We're going back.
We're very efficient.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting time.
We're addicted to work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was he one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Was he sincere?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you see it?
Was she with someone?
We wrapped the carpet.
We sat and waited.
We should ask him.
We should ask them.
We both should go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
We should go home.
We have to help them.
We should let Tom go back to work.
We shouldn't have let her go.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
We need to set a trap.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
We should have given up sooner.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
We started talking.
We're stuck in the middle.
We stayed up all night, trying to figure out a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.
We understand that.
We value our customers.
Neither of us were right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that.
We baked them a cake.
We just started.
We're waiting for her.
We were looking for them.
We've been through a lot.
We were tricked.
We tried.
We've been waiting.
We were worried.
We both saw it.
We discussed this.
We did everything we could for her.
We have a big day tomorrow.
We have one rule here.
We have something to show you.
We have the key.
We have to find him first.
We have to find him.
We have to find them first.
We have to get him into bed.
We have to get them into bed.
We have to give them something.
We have to help her.
We have to try it.
We had meetings.
We humiliated Tom.
We've lost faith in humanity.
We made mistakes.
We met a few times.
We've only met once.
We saw aliens.
We visited the castles of the Loire.
We waited outside.
We walked through the trees.
We walk to school together.
We need a new rug.
We wanted to talk about him.
We want more money.
We want to be famous.
We want to hear it.
We want to help him.
We want to help them.
We want to know about them.
We wanted to see him.
We want to see Tom.
We got up there at 11:00.
We went to pick strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We all waved for her.
We were all shocked.
We were both busy.
We didn't have any broken money.
We were completely confused.
We were 18 at the time.
We would have hung them.
We had a fight.
We were in a hurry.
We're just in time.
We just came from there.
We've been looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
They had a lot more than us.
We were passengers.
We played golf.
We were ready.
We were very close.
Save the bell.
We were so worried.
We were so young then.
We got there first.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
We're going to visit our brothers and sisters.
When we woke up in the morning, we were confronted with terrible news.
We'd have had a lot of fun if we'd gone to the party.
