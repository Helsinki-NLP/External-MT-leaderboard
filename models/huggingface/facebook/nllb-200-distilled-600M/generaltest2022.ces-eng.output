The great return of the Czech smoker is coming.
Paul French was called up to the NHL.
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A 31-year-old native of Plovdiv will be on the standby and could soon be on the gate.
Former goalkeeper of Lithuania, Plzeň and Russian Chelyabinsk injured himself in the NHL preparation in October this year.
He was on the move halfway through the game against Vegas and hasn't appeared on the NHL ice since.
The incident occurred as an experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to another.
"Paul French will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower torso injury", the Denver-based team announced in early October.
His return to the NHL's goal was eventually extended for over two months.
On a Sunday morning, American time, he was called from a farm where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He's been in the AHL for 94.5% of the procedures.
A retired ice hockey player, he wants to finally make his mark and confirm that he's in the best league in the world.
He had hip problems in his senior year and missed a single game in the shortened pandemic.
In the NHL, he's got 36 games, his passing percentage is 92.3%.
Charles is wearing Camille's Christmas dress, William and Kate are posing in Jordan.
Prince William and his wife Kate, this year's Christmas wish, have chosen a family photo taken on their trip to Jordan.
Prince Charles also made his wish known, using a photograph of his wife Camille helping her dress up on the couch.
The BBC reported this on its website.
They send their wishes to their friends, colleagues, and the foundations they work with.
The photograph was taken somewhere in the desert landscape.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing, as are Prince George and Louis, shorts and a t-shirt with a sleeve.
Whoever took the photo, William and Kate didn't say, and it's not clear exactly when it was taken.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas wish photograph on a pile of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country home in Norfolk County.
A video that serves as a Christmas wish has also been released by the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein caught them in June at a drive-by shooting in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a robe on his face, helps Camille to put on her robe in color matched to her bright dress.
According to Slavia, she promised Berbra a million for the title, which the Fort denied.
Prague  Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the alleged former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr to have a million crowns promise from Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
He informed efotbal.cz server that he had access to a section of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the top club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red-and-whites did not allow any corruption.
The server has released a transcript of police interviews, which mainly feature Slavs former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up at the championship club last summer.
A former influential white-red official was in frequent contact with Berber and former sports director Roman Rogoz of the then-second division, who is also among the accused.
Crime investigators were reportedly working with information that Slavia Berbr promised a financial reward for earning her degree.
In 2019, the SK Slavia Prague team won the first league title.
The police had knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to win the league with a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Prague officials, the server quoted from the file.
The day after, according to the criminologists, Berbr not only met Nezmar, but also the chairman of the board of Slavia Tvrdick.
The server's file no longer shows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The firm has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively sought to change the proportions of Czech football and offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal acts, we have not sought to influence arbitrators contrary to the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial support in this regard", the statement said.
In the interviews, Nezmar has indiscriminately insulted some of Slavia's former players of dark skin and also slandered his former boss Tvrdić.
The case of alleged match-fixing by arbitrators was launched last October by police raids in several places, including the Prague headquarters of the FAČR.
The highest ranking in the affair is Berber, who no longer plays any of the footballing roles.
In mid-January, like former sports director Vyšehrad Rogoz, he was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and Bvp are larping Cold War.
The ammunition will be new, but essentially of a worse type (armourists must be from armored quarters and carry the ammunition by hand without a cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, and Prague V3S has already been eliminated by specialised units.
Fighter planes: decent, but at the end of the rental, transportation - very small, short-range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
We don't have any missiles (but we make and export)
PVO: medium to cold-aged, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a chase right outside town.
The mud came up from the river and damaged the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I came in, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to mess up, so I sat quietly, and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came up, but of course the fox went away for a while.
I let her come up to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
Poor fisherman almost fucked up, waving his forehead on all sides, so I called him and said it was a fox.
He was gone before I got off the floor.
I mean, even a man's disapproval of being a Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not war, it would have to be a combination of a lot of coincidences to make something happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermoscope that almost everyone has today.
So, in a visible place, expensive things, you put your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
The war against the Hammer.
The interior got the respirators much cheaper than the health department
The state, responsible for buying and distributing clothing, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their procurement in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared purchases from different ministries and found that in a single day, the amount of the respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why have prices been so dramatically moving?
Which authorities were economically responsible?
And why did others buy a scarf?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking to the editor of the iRozhlas server, Dominica Kubištova.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I'm not affected by the memories of the CZLA that have passed through older generations), but the CZR cannot benefit from the mandatory war.
We don't even have a large inventory of techniques that training can take, we don't actually have modern techniques for existing professionals, and modern technology is getting more and more complex, so the skills of the backup will be rapidly lost over time.
With the modern conventional conflicts where anyone can deploy, they're going to be happening very quickly, there's no time to train anyone again.
And finally, the backers/territorial defense are of great importance to countries like Ukraine where mass guerrilla warfare is taking place and it's also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
In the Czech Republic, the only way to fight is in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity that the guerrillas are irrelevant and we don't have the geography to do so.
We don't have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is, half of them play like they have it.
Then you get to the point where you watch a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago go off on his own between two or even three Swiss and say, "Tell me what you think is going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll take him like the average taxpayer.
The situation with this "take the defence" scare is so terrible that I found myself truly surprised to see our attacker beating one of our opponents.
The first of the flags
The COVID pandemic is slowing, but experts do not expect any major upheavals in the coming weeks.
The resistance in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and as we know, a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more severe course, in what way vaccination or post-infection immunity from previous disease transmission helps to combat it.
But this week, an unexpected plus-side has also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, reducing the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by one-third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by Pfizer's paxlovid, which has been reported to be 85 percent successful.
The first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, however, have raised the question of how prepared the Czech administration is for the coming drugs, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
As we said, the first indigenous patients to get Molnupiravir from Merck.
The company was the first to end up on the list, because the drug was developed long before the current pandemic began, in order to find a suitable treatment for the viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
In this study, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and less open about sharing their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are used to saying "how did our mustache grow".
You're doing a survey where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people without a background will say no.
In the West, they'll tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist shit.
And then they go and they vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying this in public means losing their jobs and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, West good, East bad.
But it'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France that Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20 percent, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and are completely identical.
Identical for the purpose of rotating units so that soldiers don't have to re-learn where what is, so all objects are the same for a hair.
One is the Atom Museum of Brda and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is, the USSR didn't want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory, either for security reasons or for the speed of deployment of warheads because of its western location.
In those underground covers (there are two in each maple) only heads were stored, not the entire rocket, as they say.
If this weapon needed to be deployed, a special unit arrived to pick up the head and mount it on some carrying device.
Apart from the museum maple, the rest are in a desolate state.
We had a gypsy classmate in second grade, we were with him for four years.
He was pretty cool, he did good jokes, he often overreacted, but he was our mascot.
Everyone was having fun with him, he went out a lot and wanted to explain, he was short, he went out regularly, he played sports with us, he didn't steal snacks or phones, he went out in clean clothes.
He went to nature schools, did a lot of monkey stores, but he was fine, probably never a mess.
In the eighth or ninth grade, they were joined by siblings, gypsies in the same year, different classes.
In short, they beat up the teacher, often handled the police, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sell things for advertising sometimes (old stuff, something I don't need, etc.) and I've sold them often to gypsies, they always had money, they didn't try to get me to pay a price, communication was quiet.
I even sold a car like this, and a guy called me a month later and said he'd already rewrote it.
I tell myself I'm not a racist, I don't care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave as they should in decent society (work, work, women don't beat, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, reaches out, blows apartments and houses, has a mess around him, makes a mess... it doesn't matter what color he is, but I'll be fine.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start businesses, work, learn a language (not necessarily English, at least), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be here for them.
A young woman died in a car crash on Prachaticka
A young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation, sadly succumbed to her injuries on the spot,Zuzana Faitlova, spokeswoman for the South Czech Health Rescue Service, told the Press Office.
The accident was probably the driver who took the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle probably drove in the direction from Žíchovec to Bavorov and for unknown reasons turned into a counter-circuit.
After the crash with the Octavia Skada, a Peugeot car ended up on the roof off the highway, South Czech police spokeswoman Stefanka Schwarz described the accident.
The young driver of Peugotu suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
It was multiple injuries and he was left in a car trapped.
After his release, he had to be given emergency pre-hospital care and in stable condition was airlifted to a Českobudějovsk hospital, said the ambulance worker Fajtlova.
She added that the man in the other vehicle suffered minor chest injuries and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often fail to provide data
Luke Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He's mostly buying collector's cards.
"It can usually be tens of dollars, say from $10 above where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free", the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has been slightly delayed, he has to recalculate VAT and then submit the data to customs.
He gets an e-mail saying customs are waiting for the package to arrive.
The customs authorities shall then fill in the consignment details and, if the VAT has not already been applied to the trader at the time of sale, the customs authorities shall calculate the VAT from the total amount of the consignment and the transport.
Where the addressee does not carry out customs clearance on its own, the carrier's remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
But according to Lucas Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'll click one or two check boxes, put two attachments in, and I'm done.
For me, it's usually a five-minute question, Neuheisl says.
Not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of international mail deliveries received from abroad per day in Prague has dropped from 60,000 to 15,000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests for the data necessary to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 shipments in the international mail that we need to process.
If people had filled out all the data they need and filled it in on time, we would be about halfway there, says Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
The inflation solution
See headlines, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We're currently at 9.9% inflation and it's expected to grow further.
What do you think the government should do to slow or offset this growth?
We're seeing a reduction in VAT on food and PHM in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it's inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much have you got added (who is the employee)?
I got a 2% gross increase this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately, I have a similar income from the business I run as a businessman.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to jail for six months?
This just doesn't bother me how the court can only send such an animal to jail for six months just to do it again as soon as he gets out.
6 months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect his/her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention the rape victim never has to recover from it either.
Does that not expose potential future reports of rape?
A man from the Tomb burned his girlfriend from Kosomlat
A man from the Tomb unwittingly helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He called them to her.
He was just going for it.
First he approached a passerby and made up a story that he was robbed.
The officers called the emergency line and arrived at the scene, not surprised when the alleged robber told them that he had invented everything to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he was only asking the officers how to notify the CZP.
When the man and his girlfriend were checked, officers found out that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide manhunt, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
That's why the case solves the PPR.
An honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I personally agree that the Slavs are no longer ethnically or culturally, but I would like to know your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course, it is a pity that Churchill was unable to secure the liberation of Prague by the United States:')
Of course, I'm not denying that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimate, if I'm not mistaken, of around 10,000 different religions in the world.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say it is quite likely that in one of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will inflict terrible punishment on you if you believe in another god.
And it is written in the tenth [part] that there is no god but Jehovah.
Would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of the thousands of gods and having the one true god I have not just met sent me to hell or some other place for it?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent reserve assignment.
The Swiss model is pretty much the same.
X months of training (in different specialisations, X months on one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If you're doing well, you can get a professional offer.
All the ACRs would be fine with something like that.
It could be done in partnership with the Defense University.
We can say this: There's a constant lack of cooperation between education and industry, companies are hunting in schools, and there's some kind of integration going on, where the workforce is migrating from educational institutions to employment relationships.
Not only in adolescence, but this process is continuous, each of us is continually learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar interconnection should also be possible between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the military, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, no German or even a Mongol invader will ever come here again.
I think it's funny how you think NATO is something carved into the rock, we have allies, and they're gonna defend us if there's a mess.
Well, please, sir.
All you need is one election in the US that'll round their budget and the whole NATO is going to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have shown once that they can only turn their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that will guarantee independence in the long run is an army and a population that can master the military techniques of their time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remote controls, so what would happen?
We don't need a border fence, that's bullshit today, but a spoiled teenager can handle a remote control device.
How Not to Drown in a Box Tsunami
You wrap presents under a Christmas tree and suddenly you're home full of boxes and stuffing?
This waste is reused by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
A map of the shops that your used boxes will welcome has been created.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
So it's a shame to treat them like disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard, plastic or paper fillers to the concerned shop (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) by agreement.
It will help small businesses, reduce waste generated, and avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging that is currently in short supply and also money saved, as packaging cartons have been sold by 50% in the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of environmentally conscious customers, I am reinforcing my brand.
One such shop is Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
The boxes and the filling materials are transported to Popyvek by individuals who gather at home, but we also receive calls from companies with whom we have agreed on regular packages of deferred cartons.
We'll use all of it to pack our e-shop shipments.
With individuals and companies, we're creating a more considerate world together.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Peter the Red-Nosed Reindeer of Tierra.
However, the www.KAMsNIM.cz app does not only show pick-up points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take trash from the home, where to drop off old medicines, tires, used electricity, batteries, light sources, bulk waste, etc.).
All the waste can end up in the right place, and reusable things can find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains over 100,000 such sites.
Gradually, collection courts, reuse centres, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places are added to help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the Clean up the Czech Republic application.
I think it's rather unpleasant that these days, the technique is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they don't learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of computer files.
Because, like Google Photos or Apple's photo app or actually mobile phones, they generally just hide the underlying file system with folders and put it all on one screen in the app.
They should use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, they should learn something.
Let's rewrite history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency this weekend, starting in January, and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for protecting Europeans  at work, on the street  and mentioned so many actions that they can't be reached in six months.
But French politicians like it, and so do voters.
Macron's right-wingers and left-wingers agree on a patch, but in Europe, they do.
And in France, there will be a new head of state election in April.
The electoral calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write some of Europe's history and France is ready to create the conditions for such historians' work.
Many commentators have rushed to criticise Macron for pro-European propaganda and for rewriting history.
In fact, it's more about preventing the rewrite of history.
The far-right candidate for French President, Éric Zemmour, is now traveling around France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what's happening in France.
Wouldn't that be necessary?
Students in European countries are eager to learn history as a story of us versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs will know who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the wider context of the event was.
Is the movie of the year Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouse didn't win.
The story, which traces back to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995, also won awards for best director and best actress for Jasna Duričová.
At this year's Karlovy Vary Festival, he was on the first steps of the audience ladder.
Anthony Hopkins was the best actor in Berlin for Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy, and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "have the flu/be dead" for a couple of days, I had diarrhea and I didn't really want to smoke...
It was worse than the flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying that everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double issue, which will be released on 20 December, will contain a traditional literary annex.
And cultural tips will come along.
We're adding these books to this digital edition for you subscribers, so you can have enough time to buy them as Christmas gifts.
The prose texts follow on from the previous similar collection Petříček Sellier & Petříček Bellot.
Another portion of observing the world and describing everyday things with unparalleled poetic attention, depth and atmosphere.
In his second prose, the photographer Sixák tried to capture the essence of a small town and Czech society.
A tale of a return to the roots that turns out to be a desired illusion.
A bohemian and a computerized woman conveys the story of the Red Curtain into the setting of the present village.
Her brutality surpasses the folk version and graduates her into a horror of emotional emptiness.
And that the way back to instinct is shorter than one is willing to admit
In his final novel, the author tells a much less sentimental story of returning from emigration than we're used to hearing.
Those who stayed and those who left know too little about themselves to be able to live together.
Trains start to run under new rules, somehow the carrier changes
From Sunday, trains will start to run on the railway under the new rules.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Airlines.
For most lines, only the departure time, if any, and their route are adjusted slightly.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The airlines started selling tickets in the autumn.
The Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6783 passenger services per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains per day, under the new rules of carriage.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometers under the new rules.
In addition to national routes under the new rules of procedure, routes will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company will deploy dozens of new trains along with the new route schedule.
The main news will be the InterJet trains, which will run on the Prague to Cheb lines.
The new trains will be sent to northern Moravia or the western Czech Republic.
Carriers will also traditionally increase fare prices by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
The roads take inflation into account in their tariffs each year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet's driving rules is the entry to the R23 Ustí nad Labem  Mělník  Nymburk  Kolín.
The carrier here will replace Czech Railways after successfully entering the Ministry of Transport competition.
RegioJet will make a total of 16 journeys a day on the route, eight in each direction.
Further changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkov Brod, Žďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express maintained its 16 routes, two return routes to Slovakia and also a weekend route to Krakow.
According to the spokesman, Emile Sedlařík, the carrier tried to maintain the same timetable as possible for its long-distance trains, despite the planned layoffs.
Arriva and other carriers should continue to operate without major changes.
The carrier shall also be switched on certain regional routes.
For example, in Czechoslovakia, where the German company Die Länderbahn's Trilex trains will be used instead of the Czech ones, passengers are waiting for the changes.
Passengers will also be able to use the same train fare for the second year running.
As in the case of the Czech drachmas, their price will increase by an inflation rate of 3.2%.
I must disagree.
We're not gonna learn the other side's view?
We hear everywhere how hard they fought for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to work, they were dying.
I've never heard a lesson from the slave side or since then, no one defends this, only condemns.
No one in the schools will tell you that blacks often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school teaches you that colonists often bought land from Indians, they tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern schools.
I've never met anyone who deliberately hid the facts, but I've heard it happen before, and I think it's a problem, I'm not denying it (maybe WW2 atrocities are quite taboo in Japan).
My point was, rather, that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History doesn't care about one's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never do that again.
By the way, in the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slave laborers are quite popular there, on the other hand, they had some good successes too, and it seemed absurd to reject them.
And the North wasn't much better than many people today think it is.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and they had a lot of issues.
I wouldn't compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and maybe our view of them doesn't exist (YT also had a TV video where they beat someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country never experienced.
Overall, I thought that at some universities it was terrifying, that these students were pretty radical, and the schools were supporting them a lot.
And when I imagine these people are going to be much older one day, I'm a little sick of this being the majority vote, because among the young, and among the ruling elite.
I think feminism has achieved what it has long ago, and it's not about the same thing anymore, it's about radicalisation.
Now, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, and so are other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalisation on the other side, which often leads to resistance even for pretty reasonable things.
Plus, the more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
Anyway, I also didn't get to be judged for colonialism or slavery.
I've probably encountered the wrong geography, but it was a two-way street:D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely irrelevant.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I didn't do on my own?
And I think the concept of nationality is generally useless in terms of some sort of personal identity.
If anything connects me to people, it's interests, worldviews, shared experiences, not where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and one Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a really nice guy, preaching more about theology than politics, but then he always makes a shit about coronavirus, and everybody's ashamed.
Then, of course, there's the Church of Czechoslovakia.
Officially they're Protestants, but in fact they're born of a Catholic modernity and are actually Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to the Hussites because it's very similar theologically, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functional temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael's Church in Dominican Square is a Dominican church, and even there they hold Mass in Latin every Sunday at 3 p.m., as they did before Vatican II.
The flames of Bethlehem are in the Czech Republic, the scouts took them from Austria.
The flame lit in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born, according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but this time they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal Břeclav border crossing.
He was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that my department and I share every year, I look forward to it.
It's an honor to be chosen, Scout Amália Budica told reporters here.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal  Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
But usually for him, the scouts take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes with the spread of flames through the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cykrlem.
The lighting will be carried out by Scout couriers on Saturday 18 December, travelling by selected express trains and private trains.
Local scouts or volunteers will take over the lighting from them, and they will spread the flames across the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, too, scouts must comply with the measures in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going on just like last year.
We recommend that both these courier teams and local event organizers wear shirts, try to keep the size of the shirts to a minimum, not sing to colleagues, just behave as safely as possible, Bethlehem Light's spokeswoman Zuzana Hrbková said.
The tradition of the Bethlehem Light, which travels through Europe, was born in Austria in 1986.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time as the flame.
The light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope for believers, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, its spread has been taken care of by scouts and scouts for over 30 years.
The action is being organized by hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of generosity and human reciprocity.
All updates, including a list of places people can come to get the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economics degree, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology, healthcare and education are using the money properly, but I don't understand why it's being put into agriculture, industry and businesses in general.
As mentioned, it produces a useless product and it breaks the free market and the natural life of the company.
I myself work in a factory where a million Xyx banners are co-financed by the Xyx project and a company like that is just artificially kept alive.
This is not supporting a company that employs people, this is a developmental disruption where this company is either holding on and taking contracts/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after it's gone.
I totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person born in the Internet age will fall for a trick or a trap - especially advertising.
I don't think I'm getting any Internet advertising, but then I find myself being influenced by it - it's just so out of fashion that you don't always resist.
I therefore support the radical voices in the European Parliament who are currently calling for a total ban on programmatic advertising...
It's all crap, in classic words - I would ban the Internet.
I have a feeling this thread has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe what most people believe and it makes sense, because I am not a sheep, but I will believe something less likely, it makes little sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion which I will say is critical thinking"
"Because I won't believe everything the media says"
3 "Untrusted Politicians"
TVs have fallen into the Christmas movie trend, with 200 of them premiering this year.
Los Angeles  Cinema, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the Christmas movie trend and this year will premiere a record-breaking two hundred of them to their audiences.
This was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of family and romantic films has been gaining popularity in recent years, and is therefore becoming more popular.
Four times as many Christmas movies were made this year as in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
IMDb's database has only included images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will be a lot more Christmas movies.
The movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are associated with this period, and worldwide, pictures of the film Alone at home, Love from Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular.
But the real Christmas movie boom didn't start until 2009, when a special series of movies came to the American cable television channel Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her adventure project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was a huge success.
This year, the station began broadcasting its Christmas programming on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Lifetime, the network's competitor, has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its agenda this year, and popular streaming platforms like Netflix are contributing to the total.
"In this magical time of year, the story doesn't really matter, it's important that there are lots of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows", said Brandon Gray, author of the book I'll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For the viewers, it's a form of escape and a way to feel a little calm for at least two hours amid all the holiday craziness and the madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years", Gray added.
For example, he says Hallmark TV uses the same recipe for its movies, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people falling in love, but then, about half an hour before the end of the conversation, some misunderstanding is resolved, and the two kiss.
It's always like this, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people watch one after the other, Gray adds.
Mazepin tested positive for covid-19, and he won't be able to reach the final race of F1.
Only 19 riders will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin tested positive for covid-19 and will not run until the final race of the season.
So Stj Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he was to attack a better position from the 20th hole he had taken in qualifying.
But the Russian Nikita Mazepin of the Haas stable will not eventually intervene in the Abu Khai Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only 19 cars will appear on the grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher taking the race from the last lap, and Max Verstappen from the first, who will fight Lewis Hamilton in a straight title battle.
Mazepin is reportedly in good health and has no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the competent public health authorities, with safety as the ultimate priority for all parties involved", her representatives told formula1.com.
He's not sending a replacement driver to the Haas race, and he can't.
The candidate would have to complete a qualification or a trip on another part of the weekend.
The first runner is not affected by Covid-19.
The season just ended with Kimi Räikkönen starting with Covid-19, and last year, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
You could go to jail for that, too.
And everyone will be robbed of what the boss said.
From a legal standpoint, covid is on the list of infectious diseases.
So in the same group as HIV, the flu, yellow fever or typhoid.

(1) Whoever willfully causes or increases the risk of the spread or spread of infectious diseases in humans shall be punished by imprisonment for six months to three years, a ban on activity or a failure to do business.
(2) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for two to eight years,
(c) if he has committed an act which breaches an important duty arising from his employment, profession, position or function or which is imposed on him by law; or
(d) if such an act causes serious harm to health.
(3) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of three to ten years if, by an act referred to in paragraph 1, he causes serious injury to the health of at least two persons or death.
(4) The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for five to 12 years if the offence referred to in paragraph 1 causes the death of at least two persons.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: the price of the most expensive sweater is amazing!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the designer put six months of work and all his savings into it.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, sweaters were never worn much in my home", admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours working on his work in six months.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France, and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were then decorated with 150 diamonds.
The foundation is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater. It praises its maker for his work, which, of course, he does not recommend washing.
And there's one more hook.
"I'm in complete danger, I need to sell my sweater as soon as possible", admits Lebanon.
If he succeeds, he'll set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost only 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Women, explorers and drones could be launched before Christmas, and the mission is approved for six months.
They are to assist their Polish counterparts in securing the border with Belarus and in building the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested the help of NATO states in connection with the months-long actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of the Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating in Polish territory.
The Omikron mutation spreads to the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is investigating another case of Adam's baby.
We're currently reporting further suspicion of this variant in another Adamov child, a prep student.
Direct contact with previous cases from the Adams family is not proven, Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the county in a week.
We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases It is being carried out by the National Flu and Non-Flu Virus Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Health in Prague,the Director said.
She added that they were two nurses from the same workplace at the Brno Faculty Hospital and two children of one of them, plus two 11-year-old students from ZŠ Adamov.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them have mild symptoms, four have no symptoms, according to the principal.
No one with Omikron's suspicions has traveled abroad.
None of these people have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they come into contact with anyone who is abroad.
None of these men have any connection to the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
The head of hygiene Pavla Svrčinová earlier said that an international water polo tournament was being examined in Brno a few weeks ago.
The South African players were also on board and one Belgian player fell ill after returning.
California is restricting the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas's abortion ban.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of some weapons in the most populous U.S. state by using the legal mechanism Texas used in its controversial abortion law against heartbeat-impregnated embryos.
People would then be entitled to compensation in the case of anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom's announcement was a response to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday that upheld Texas' abortion ban, although it violates a nearly 50-year-old precedent that established the right to abortion throughout the United States until about the 24th month of pregnancy.
The Court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the whole law but on the technical question arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban has been brought to the public's attention in this case, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to prosecute it through the usual court system.
"I am outraged by yesterday's (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which upheld Texas' ban on most abortion services and largely supported the Texas manoeuvre to protect its law", the governor of California said.
"If states can now block federal courts from reviewing their laws, then California will use that power to protect human lives", Newsom continues.
He said he had instructed his subordinates to work with the state parliament and the justice minister on measures that would empower public officials to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is the designation of domestically manufactured weapons which do not have serial numbers and which can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants private citizens to have the right to demand at least $10,000 in damages and court damages from anyone who manufactures, distributes or sells assault rifles, ghost weapons components or sets for their manufacture in California.
"If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that's exactly what we should be doing", the governor of California said.
The AP reports that California has banned the manufacture and sale of certain military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor would be true, who, in her dissent to the majority ruling on Friday, warned against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant Texas' abortion ban complete immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected individuals in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccine has its own public testing phase, where the vaccine pattern is gradually determined and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, a large study on the effects of 4 doses is already underway in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients have up to five times the antibody level, which is the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it's going to have its own vaccine schedule over time, but it's too soon.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus is expected to be on the market soon, which promises up to 10x more efficacy according to manufacturer specifications.
The quantity is easy to keep.
But re-evaluate what you learn.
Since the time of Mary Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a little bit and learning phone records and writing textbooks into notebooks is no longer very meaningful and is a waste of time.

Poland has threatened to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would be acting unlawfully if it used its new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw EUR 36 billion from the EU Recovery Fund for the economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and to use a mechanism to withdraw Union subsidies from countries violating the rule of law.
Poland should respond to this EU blackmail by vetoing all matters that require unanimity, said Ziobro, head of the small party Solidarity Poland, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
Poland should also consider its commitments to the EU's energy and climate policies, which lead to a drastic increase in energy prices Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland cease its EU contributions.
It would be justifiable given that the EU is illegally depriving us of the resources from the common budget to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance on EU accession than the ruling Law and Justice party.
The European Commission considers that the changes that the Polish judiciary has undergone during Ziobr's term are threatening its independence and subordinating it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is setting up impossible conditions because its aim is not a rule of law but a change of government in Poland.
Warsaw faces a "political dictatorship of blackmail and attempts to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Poles", Ziobro said.
He said that Poland should be a member of an EU based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy, which is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never take steps to make concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree to Poland having colonial status", he declared.
But to be honest, we have the same kind of cheese in four different places in Lidl.
I didn't look for other things, I met one yogurt a few times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks, I quit and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector, they were all selective, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If there's a shortage, I'm not going to any more markets, no events, no gold goods in the square, they may not have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and it's got some sort of order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
I'm going to Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care about that anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data being treated like fertilizer here, and most of the anti-vaccinationists are just a little bit more out of bowl than most pro-vaccinationists.
Rational discussion is taking place at the professional level, but only extreme opinions are being brought into the public domain.
From wall to wall, all the time.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is useless.
Banning everything, allowing everything.
Colored cakes instead of robust analytics.
Comparing apples to pears.
This state has it this way, and we have it this way.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in those two states, no one can solve.
Fuj, I'm so relieved of myself.
Sorry about the spill, and I wish you all a good day.
I was punished with a stove when I was a kid.
It was never about the grades, mostly just repeatedly refusing to listen and being mean (reading instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, and my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would be wounded (sometimes even after another "turning" she just brought the kettle and put it down so I could see it).
It was only after repeatedly refusing to listen that I got a few stab wounds to the butt.
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable terms and in proportion) is beneficial because a child responds to it far more than words.
I think the warning part is important because it gives the child a choice in a way of whether or not he will obey and get it or he will get better and not be punished.
In the end, I was usually only warned to start listening.
Defence of the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and Constitutional Judge Vojtěch Cepl in 1999 answered a press question about what the Czech Constitution means to him  whether the sacred document to which he is sworn and which he refused to teach is taught in school or, conversely, an agreement which can be amended if necessary, he was definitely inclined to the first concept.
Once in the Constitution, we agreed on democratic rules of our lives that define who we are as a state and its citizens, and that it's better to save on change.
And imagine: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as Czechs like donuts with pork and cabbage, he was asking the question of Vojtěch Cepl.
However, in recent years, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs to be amended has become increasingly popular among lawyers.
The year is tested by situations that its creators (including Vojtěch Cepl) could not have foreseen, for example, the conduct of the directly elected president.
But Cepl was right about one thing.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference with their texts must be thought through.
The Constitution needs to be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies have encountered throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of government system consisting of individual rules that set the game's mantines for politicians.
We're afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we're banning politicians.
But at the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid doesn't pick up, FN Brno is fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder in children, there are also serious cases that hospitals have been facing mainly recently.
"We know that children are less at risk and affected than adults, 2 to 5 percent more than adults", Petr Dominik, head of the Clinic for Child Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno Faculty Hospital and Masaryk University Medical School, told the newspaper.
The procedure is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children's patients who are seriously ill with coronavirus, which we are seeing especially recently", Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
This is at the infant infectious disease clinic.
Really, really seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with post-COVID syndrome have been in the doctor's office continuously throughout the year.
There is now an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is pneumonia, which requires resuscitation, he said, adding that the disease affects adults alongside adolescents and several-month-old babies.
Children are also in critical condition in hospitals because of the coronavirus.
"We currently have a child of several months and adolescence", the mayor said.
However, she is happy that the FN Brno Children's Hospital has not yet reported any child deaths from coronavirus.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominic, the children's hospital is not just a part of the coronavirus ward, but also an integral part of the psychologist's work.
It also points out that, as in adults and children, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-COVID syndrome.
That's why we recommend the vaccine dose in children,the doctor added.
In the quiet zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the peace zones aren't that big.
They're on the tourist map on maps.
Generally, in national parks outside the peace zone, you can walk anywhere (but don't go over the fence into the area).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside the designated paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not very common outside national parks).
How does the conductor practice?
The music comes to mind, Joseph Kurfiřt laughs.
He's a liberal opera singer, and originally played in the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing virtually all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberace F. Shaldy Theatre, but also in Plzeň, the Josef Kajetan Tyl Theatre.
He works with the Palatine Philharmonic, the Film Philharmonic or the Lower Crete Symphony Orchestra.
China is building the impression that the disease is being managed and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis
Sinologist Jiroush: China is building the impression that the epidemic is being managed and that the authoritarian regime is better at dealing with the crisis.
China has embarked on a health and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop the pandemic, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting zero increases in infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment and Chinese doctors are helping in many ways in the fight against coronavirus, including in the worst-hit Italy.
How do you see Beijing's willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and he says, "Hey, you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
My wife is happy because she saves the grass, she washes the car with a hopper, the kids play with it.
Oh, that's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
- Yeah, we'll have a little fun.
After a while they meet and the guy who bought it complains, "You're the one who sold it for an elephant, man".
The lawn is crumbling, the shit's all over the place, the car's all over the place, the kids are scared of him, and the wife wants a divorce.
The guy who sold it says, "You talk bad about an elephant, you can't sell an elephant like that...
World affairs are dominated by the great powers.
Although sovereign states are equal, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works towards its integration.
It is currently operating at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
I personally think Europe is heading for federation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in half a century, the mood will be different and we'll do it.
I thought of that, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so I might be able to spell it.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
I'll borrow an example from another commentary on Spanish oranges and mandarins, where it's clear that they're both from Spain, whereas Spanish fruit and mandarins are no longer clear that they're from Spain.
And I'm basing this on the fact that the sentence is all the American forces, including their weapons, and I know that American complexes are operated by Americans only.
In other words, I expect that this is already covered by the broad term and no further specification is needed for American forces.
But again, maybe just the wording:D
Either way, it's a pointless request.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured the cosmic monkey Milly
Terrifying footage shows the moment when a frightened monkey crawls in a toilet basin before its ruthless owner washes it and laughs at it.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrates' Court now banned her from raising animals for life, reports The Sun.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who are taking care of Milly after her abuse said they've never seen a cosmonaut so frightened.
Milly spent almost two years in rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset and now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon again.
Four-time mother pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary harm to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment with a one-year suspended sentence at Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, banned from animal husbandry for life and ordered to pay a total of 12 000 crowns in court costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said, "Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue".
It took Milly a while to get used to people again.
She was crouching and hiding from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she's settled down and satisfied with a male, the sight of new people in her can still cause panic.
The psychic scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's harassment came to light after Gwent police discovered scary footage of her wife's phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
You can hear Milly on the footage, vulgarly cursing.
In another video, you can hear a Dutch monkey offering cocaine and saying, "Do you want cocaine?"
So, lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possession of cocaine with the intent to sell it.
In her home, 1,600 pounds of cocaine (equivalent to less than 50,000 crowns) were found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Holland received a 20-month probationary sentence.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that ancient one three times in a row as you bravely jump through the entire 20th century?
Like you're gonna take the same stuff in first grade as you did in sixth grade?
And all that kills the idea of whining, when no one, honorable exceptions, cares if you can or understand.
Just write a test for one and then nobody cares.
Go and ask random people on the street if they can determine the roots of the quadratic equations and coefficients.
Everybody's been through it, and the vast majority won't even cut their hair and tell you they're totally fucked.
So what the fuck is this teaching?
I'm a big fan of the general overview, and the reality is that people don't want or need it.
And at that point, it's useless, and you're never gonna get it in them anyway.
Part of it is learned for the many people who will need the thing.
But like, the note that you don't really need to stand at the machine for all this, I meant it really seriously... ...because you just don't need to.
Plus, we're slowly getting to a point where not knowing is a punch mark.
(Which probably includes our communist past and the anger against educated people and elites) But the price of barbarians being barbarians is simply high.
If journalists could count, the covid probably never reached this level.
The first-hand wedding: the war between Kadri and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason why she can't leave Switzerland right now", Andrea responded to the omnipresent questions of curious fans on Instagram on Stories, which she was so disappointed with on Kadrim that she decided to cut all contact and even block it on social media.
Kadrim and Andrea have been in a tight spot since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea was moving in with her, at least until he returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only ended in love, but grew in disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack by you! He was upset by Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged honesty was no longer appreciated by his ex-wife, even by his younger sister Linda.
She decided to stand up for her brother publicly.
I don't normally speak out about things like that, and we never really talked about it in our family.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and smear the name of someone I love so much, I just don't like it!
I'm sorry I have to do it this way, but I want to thank my brother Kadri publicly for making a character out of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, despite his young age.
I'm even more sorry to read this kind of false information that's probably quite taken out of context.
I wish everyone knew Kadri as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrey's words.
I'm really grateful for everything!
Of course, people will believe what's written, but most importantly, we, his family, love him above all else and know the facts and know what it really was like, she added.
A drunken thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao started his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential neighborhood, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually took out less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he couldn't think of a better way to go up to the fifth floor and enter the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas there.
One of the security cameras then caught him walking down the street away from the crime scene eating a banana.
When the owner woke up this morning, he found the bananas were not where they were, and he called the police.
She then detained the Ccha.
The man admitted to drinking some alcohol on the day of the incrimination.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob while drunk.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the fifth floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effectively tied to pandemic preparedness.
If it's repealed, the law will not be in effect.
The law limits the scope of business
Isn't that enough reason?
The right to assemble shall be restricted, but not abolished.
Over 60 percent of the electorate in four municipalities voted in Saturday's election.
The new parliamentary elections were held on Saturday in the communes of Komna in Uherskohradišťšťska, Lužice in Mostecka, Novo Ves na Liberecku and Rovno in Pelhřimovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected representative body has dissolved.
A total of 99 candidates were running for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected members is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33.
Processing the results of Saturday's election symbolically ends a rather difficult but successful year for us.
A total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils took place, and in particular a very closely watched election to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Republic.
She recalled that the COVID-19 epidemic made the choices more difficult for equipment and personnel security.
In the Chamber of Deputies in Uherskohradišťšťsk, the Independent Candidates' Association won the elections on Saturday, winning 27.76% of the vote and two seats in the seven-member Chamber of Deputies.
The STAN candidate received 24.84% of the vote, which also means a two-term win.
The citizens of the Chamber also won two seats in the Chamber of Deputies, with 18.52% of the voters casting their vote.
The current mayor of the municipality, Jan Křižková, who is a member of the Soukromniki, also became a member of the parliament.
The House of Representatives was won by independent candidates for one term.
75.48 percent of eligible voters turned out for the polls.
In the town of Rovna in Pelhřimovsk, the association Pro Rovna won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four of seven terms.
Two other representatives from the Independent Candidates' Association 1 and one from the Independent Candidates' Association 2 were elected to the municipal council.
The turnout was 93.62 percent.
The elections in Lužice na Mostecce were won again by the Lužice and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member House of Representatives.
The candidate for the People's Republic, who received 43.27 percent of the vote, finished second, thus having three representatives in the House of Representatives.
76.7 percent of the electorate voted.
The election in the New Town in Liberia was won by the Independent candidate of Hope for the New Town before the ANO Movement.
The Independent candidates' association was voted on by 59.88% of voters, gaining four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and has strengthened against the 2018 regular elections, gaining a mandate more and has three.
The turnout was 42.9 percent.
On Monday, the results of the election will be considered by the State Election Commission.
Then they will be published in the Law Collection.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign policy?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to "quarrel" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which was, after all, the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes what.
On the other hand, I'm concerned about how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, like the 1930s.
You may believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together.
The man fell head down from 12 meters.
He survived the impact on the concrete.
An incredible fall was survived by a man in Ostrava who was hit by rescue workers from the Regional Health and Safety Service on Sunday night.
County operations center staff picked up an hour after midnight Saturday an emergency call with preliminary information about a man falling from a height.
Two ZZS crews, medical and medical, arrived immediately.
Upon arrival, the medical examiner found that a 27-year-old man had fallen from a window about 12 feet [12 m] high and hit his head on concrete!
It's got coal in the windmills.
But not as well as it should have been, and the fire department went into action.
At the time of the rescue team's arrival, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and life-threatening injuries.
The doctor who intercepted his breathing, provided artificial ventilation of his lungs and, following further measures under the pre-hospital emergency care, an ambulance transported him to the Ostrava Trauma Center, said Lukáš Humpl, spokesman for the Ostrava State Medical Service.
I'm more concerned about the inadequate response from the public and the authorities than I am about the coronavirus.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and healthcare workers are at the forefront of the fight against the infection.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking the military doctor David the Cutter.

The legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt.
MMA had a great gala night full of interesting results.
Because things were happening at UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Penny has managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who has not found a winner in seven years.
Charles Oliveira was lightweight, he gave a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
Kai Kara-France also won the race, quickly beating Cody Garbrand with a technical knockout in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
A surprise no one expected.
That was the result of a bantamweight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Penny.
The American entered the battle as a fanciful dwarf, for Nunes had not lost for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
Moreover, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper presuppositions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave her opponent a push kick to send her down.
However, Penny refused to be forced to make another mistake and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was a thrill and a very exciting one for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honored with a lot of excellent hits and hard hooks.
Plus, Penny got Nunes on the ground, and she started choking her.
She must have tried to give up and unleash the attack.
The American woman was such a shock to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Poirier was better off at first, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active than Oliveira, who tried to hit his opponent with a lever on the hand.
He failed to do so, but then he put a lot of pressure on his opponent, putting him on his back and putting him to sleep with a series of wounds.
That's how he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked shock, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to untie the strangulation.
The Brazilian defended the title, but Poirier lost two years later.
In the next game, Sean O'Malley claimed a sovereign victory, already in the first round, putting a hard right back on Raulian Paiv.
He then struck him with a series of precise strikes, and he recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to consult with Cody Garbrand.
In the spring Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now lost after seven years.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
Most substantive names in Czech express only one grammatical gender, so it is not difficult for them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle gender.
But there is also a fairly large group of nouns whose genus is not fixed.
Such substantive names vary between the two families.
When tilted, they then take on double ends and in some cases remain untilted.
For example, the words svízel or kyčel are of both male and female origin, in the former they are slanted according to the pattern machine, in the latter according to the pattern spis.
For other groups of nouns, different forms are already present in the first case of the unit number, e.g.: order/order, kedluben/kedlubna or brambor/potato (in the sense of food).
Both shapes are literary, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may vary regionally, for example okurka in the Czech Republic and okurek in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian word pairs: příkop and příkopa, kobliha and koblih etc.
Some words that have entered Czech from other languages were originally unstressed, but are gradually taking over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression image, which is of male and female origin, or the word bufet, which remained uninclined in the middle genus but has endings in the male pattern hrad.
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation right on the Greek border?
The Greek-Turkish border is under tension due to the growing number of migrants trying to get into Europe.
Thousands of people began to march to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising Greece support, and the Czech government is also planning humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to take an uncertain path?
And what's the situation right here?
We haven't seen blue skies for three months and we've choked, a Sydney journalist describes.
The devastating fires that have plagued Australia for the past four months have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of acres of land.
How do the local authorities and the residents themselves cope with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison have done more to prevent the drastic impacts, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the face of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel is speaking to a Sydney journalist named Ikou Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That's why everyone is always being written about everywhere.
It's uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to address it.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've seen how people are often treated by their neighbors or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their trauma.
But too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who make false accusations.
It's disgusting to spit in the face of all sexual assault victims, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the accusations are fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual assailants.
Czech Republic flooded with broken-down houses, families without money to finish
Building materials prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a difficult situation because of it.
She has no means to complete the demolished family homes and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the cost of construction works is also increasing.
People therefore do not have enough money to complete the family homes that have already been demolished.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage lending, creating extremely uncomfortable situations.
At best, people move into decorated, uncluttered homes.
In the worst case, the demolished houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent", says BHS economist Stefan Křeček.
We're going to build two or three family homes in a year, and 50 percent of us have.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep certain things contractual even when the material is being auctioned off.
So we're doing it without profit", said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are just gonna have financial problems.
If they counted on five million to build the house, now it's going to cost seven.
I think some will wait", added Snow White.
The most expensive of these was copper, iron, and heating and plumbing equipment.
But construction companies also struggle with labor shortages.
The Czech Republic is lacking in building graduates and the influx of foreign workers is slowing the pandemic.
Only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favourable at this time.
Construction authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, almost 10 percent more than a year ago,Clarified Křeček.
We're doing well and we're going to be doing even better.
But the real vision is missing, says the Czech commentator
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the New Year's Eve was traditionally marked by political speeches.
This year, besides the Prime Minister and President of ANO Andreja Babiš and the Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the people.
What fundamental lesson have we learned?
Like, I'm getting a degree right now, I have my own subject I picked, I go to my bachelor's, I always do it all year long, and then I write a piece in a week or two.
The state is completely at peace with us, unless you're a total ape and you have something left in your head, the commission won't suffocate you in theory.
I was a week-long public school teacher, and when I was done, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical conclusion that I got right.
And by the way, these projects, I know people who pay someone to do that semester project for them (we did it a lot of times, really helpful, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they get carried away.
I think it's great when at the end of the subject, there's a test that reflects the knowledge gained from the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't take out your e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same dick as them.
These people at the embassy don't have to have anything to do with this.
And if they were against Russia, they'd be taking a big risk, so maybe they'll have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a statue of Putin next to the Po Bear.
You need to put it on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing clubs at artists.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least a new picture every other day, your reach will be reduced to a minimum.
Plus, he keeps changing what's more important, like, comment or save.
I've been so sick lately, I might have to reduce myself to a tick where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and hardly allow it.
And finally, I'd like to see something more user-friendly that doesn't draw all the creativity and energy from artists.
Declaration of the Donbass Working Party
The union yes, the breakup no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the image.
Thirty years since the illegal collapse of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
In the Bělovorsk Forest of 8 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškević, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with the open and sympathetic attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that the USSR as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceased to exist.
With one pen, they destroyed a vast country of nearly three hundred million people.
The collapse of the USSR left tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia's population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the population of the former Soviet republics, we have lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what had been built in the previous 70 years in one session in the Bělovorský prales betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, stopped agriculture, separated 14 republics from the world's greatest power, which had previously been economically linked in a single mechanism.
If we look deeper, we see the depopulation, the decline of the economy, the decline of science, the decline of the military, the rise of crime, the interethnic conflict, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria -- all of this is the result of geopolitical capitulation, the surrender of the socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There's a concept in political science like the vacuum of power.
Everything that was quickly betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we have some meat at the supermarket, which costs $189.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality where I don't buy the meat on Monday, I'll sell it at a discount on Tuesday at $99 a pound - can you describe the mechanism by which changing the price of that meat becomes a burden on my digestive system?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat is discounted to $69, which is a day before the date of consumption - what would make this meat different from what I bought on Monday by $120 a drawer and left it in my refrigerator for three days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
These rumors that if something is cheap, it must be bad, bad, or low quality, they're terribly retarded, to tell you the truth.
I just recently went to the Brno on the Head and in the basement the ladies were handing out some brochure, I always take the same stuff to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of rural reason and conservative views on how the world works, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it, and it turned out to be Scientology.
Well, like he was a good kid, full of totally useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a dick.
It's a shame about the paper, because that's why the forests don't have to be blown.
I had a similar experience with an ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to conform to the person because you love them without realizing how fucked up the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and got down on her knees and begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for a year, but then another six months passed and she started kicking her dick.
Then I ended the relationship by telling her I was breaking up and insisting we could talk about it next week so I could calm her down and not get her in trouble again.
Such a person sucks out of you feelings, emotions, and overall joy.
Better to keep a distance
When the insurance companies are furiously robbing the place by buying a cloud of tests and chasing positive ones who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease if they hadn't been tested.
All we're getting is complications for companies, carriers and others because their employees in the random number generator have been sentenced to five days of house arrest.
In the West, they've stopped the ridiculous, and they've recognized that there's no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, Valk is new and has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing a buzzword.
I see we're getting back to the good old bastard.
After years of oppression and suppression of this rogue business, MLM recruiting is back on the rise.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, freshman in high school), and the initial promise of product training and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to be interested, you just get people".
I was really interested in the products I was offering because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare and talk to people.
When the first money was made, one quickly realized that if one wanted to make money, one had to make a few products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable ones, making one feel like a pot-smoker.
What I can tell you is that experience was valuable, and you learned not to jump right into every possible situation and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put them all in one bag.
There are successful and even beneficial people in this business, but they will certainly not boast about expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I've never seen much of that in the corporate world I work for.
HR is calm, managers are watching their management and they're not putting too much pressure on us.
So regular evaluation is going on, in the way that we're doing it, it's pretty good (set goals for next year, we'll see what works out next year, we'll see what doesn't) - it's more about self-evaluation than being evaluated by numbers, and so on.
Corporate actions are also non-compulsory.
But we're a little unique within our company, too - there are departments that are more corporate.
Sometimes you feel like we're some kind of near-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation, well.
But it works so they don't bother us as long as the results are there.
The Czech who went missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched in vain for a missing 32-year-old Czech who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, the resigned Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulhánek announced on social media that a woman from Uherskohradishtska was found dead.
British police confirmed to our London office this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
Cause of death is under investigation.
We're not giving any more information on the case, considering the family.
He tweeted his condolences.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th on a bus on her way home from work, and she was supposed to have picked up money from an ATM before she got on board.
Her disappearance was reported by her co-workers five days later.
Then the London police began searching for her, and Interpol listed her among the world's missing.
It also appeared in the Czech missing persons database.
Police have arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspects, but she didn't reveal.
Four municipalities have been assigned new representatives by the end of the year
On Saturday 11 December, the new parliamentary elections were held in the communes of Komna in Uherskohradišťšťsko, Lužice in Mostecko, Nová Ves na Liberecku and Rovna in Pelhřimovsko.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has decreased under the law or the elected representative body has dissolved.
In the 28 terms, 99 valid candidates contested the new elections.
The turnout was 62.41%.
The highest level of interest was recorded in Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was won by a total of eight women and 20 men.
The average age of the elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the Chambers of Deputies in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men running for 28 seats.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest was 72 years old.
Processing the results of Saturday's election symbolically ends a rather difficult but successful year for us.
Four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils took place, and in particular a very closely watched election to the Chamber of Deputies.
We have had to work mostly in more difficult epidemic conditions, which have made greater demands on equipment and staff security, said Eva Krump, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
The last constituency was drawn up on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be considered by the State Election Commission and, once approved, will be published in the Bills.
This is the biggest problem I've had with the pandemic.
It took me a while to deal with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease here, but it was without further ado.
To deal with how stupidly a large part of the population at all levels is acting, that's what I've had a problem with so far.
I'm looking forward to getting the vaccine tomorrow because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being shit.
He would be stripped of his presidency and his ability to re-assume it.
The chances of this happening are very small, as others here mention.
Besides, I'm not sure if a charted record could be considered a treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of a republic endangers the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It had to be something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are sexually unavailable year-round is increasing
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
These are mostly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the percentage of people under 35 who give up their sex life rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they hadn't had sex in the past year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But it may also have been the presence of media, social media, and video games that make sex less and less of a priority for young people.
"Since 2010, the proportion of men and women aged 18 to 35 who report not having sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly", said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Married people are more likely to have sex, with only 5 percent of them reporting having had no sex in the past year in 2021.
Among single people, it was 29 percent, and Stone added that marriage under 35 is only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital contact and religious establishment also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of those under 35 who are married is still declining.
Young people have divided opinions about premarital sex, with about 30 percent considering it a bad thing, while about 70 percent think it's okay.
"It's true that among single individuals in this age group, they are a minority, but their behavior is driving this trend", Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most people who have a moral problem with premarital sex, it's a religious foundation.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence among single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month has increased from 20 to nearly 60 percent.
Among the less-believers, the trend has risen from 10 to 20 percent", Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that sex is less likely in people without jobs or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, replacing this need.
This trend was mainly caught up in the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole COVID vaccine mandate is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave that they don't want but that can save their lives.
It's a pretty difficult question, and the question of social conscience that interests me most personally.
That is, the question of whether if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have killed an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn't get the shot, and he ended up catching it and dying.
On the other hand, I don't think we can blame the death of a hardened anti-vaccination opponent who, alongside the SPD and the CCP, is shouting about bullying and totalitarianism.
From the statistics I've mentioned, it's pretty clear that most unvaccinated retirees are probably in the second group, so they'll actually be able to do it themselves.
The Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
The operators of the ski areas will not go without technical snow, and the weather may complicate the preparation of the Jizersk Fifty.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the Czech drought?
I'd have a story, but it's not about the pimp.
One day in high school, a teacher led us across the city on a boat launch so we could take a boat ride across the river.
On our way there, we went down a fairly wide street and we don't see anyone in the middle - Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they came down on us.
I ran away, but a friend of mine got in trouble.
When she left, she and the teacher asked what she was telling them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul", she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the dockyard.
We're really spoiled.
Not much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozović
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, flew to Warsaw on Sunday, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
'We are opening a new chapter in our relations,' Morawiecki told a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
The crisis caused by the worrying movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is to be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the Normandy Group, which includes France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons because night after night we are recording hundreds of attempts to cross the (illegal) border.
He and the Chancellor discussed further sanctions so that Lukashenko's regime and its Kremlin patrons would finally understand that we have decided to defend the EU's eastern border.
According to the DPA, Scholz assured Warsaw of German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime of refugees.
A drunk Polish nun blamed the accident, tried to cover it up.
The car returned to the scene after a while, but the car was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for failing to drive and escape the scene of an accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had run into her car and asked for help.
Then the cops came for Celestine's sister.
They ran her breathing tests, and after finding that she had more than two passes in her blood, they immediately took her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo's dog is doing what he can.
But Yuraj Shayimovich didn't take his film seriously.
Czech family comedy creators have been featured in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film industry.
After the booby-trap of F. Brabce Gump, the dog that taught people how to live, there's another movie about the emotions of the audience in theaters right now.
Co-writer and director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely continues his previous film Here I Watch from 2012.
Speaking little Hugo and some of the famous characters around him return to the stage.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of a shanty home that is dying, are inviting the dogs, Julien's father and partner, and most of all her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, she's a teenage girl who's having her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had to deal with the storytelling procedures in the previous picture with dogs, but there they had fun with at least children and the dog.
This time, the creative team wrote an even weaker script that conjures up a mixture of awe and embarrassment.
Let's get this straight.
Julie, although a scientist, is subject to the mistakes of the dark, and if the right constellation comes along, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just to determine  on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an excursion with a local guide), the retired Colonel Mojmír, despite his years of travel, shoots his own daughter (Julii), who falls into a coma, on the woods, the family is taken to the hospital to play the miraculous process of healing a dog in the heart of the forest loneliness.
Nothing against the purity of nature and the power of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazed at the amount of content and imagery that was needed to deliver this message.
Two staff thieves, a dog-racing, a shoemaker, cops coming to confess to looking for drugs and discussing the fertility of bone marrow and the obviously drunken family in the boarding house.
When a heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits undulating and cranked with a cigar at the family table and demands her father's whiskey and flacota as a cured vegetarian, she can't help but laugh.
The design will explain to the viewer's creators that this sometimes happens after a coma.
The team lacks the basic dramatic knowledge of text, the ability to depict situations, the sense of character and point and direction.
The acting is unbalanced, the cut is helpless, and the overall impression is flat.
As much as Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to keep their party together, they have little to play with.
The only remaining poetic images of the forest nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomek and a pair of hedgehogs remain.
It's not enough to sketch out a few characters, a chatty plot and dog lyrics, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters indulge in.
It's not even a year's membership in the Peanut Breeders' Club that's the argument, as in the case of Mrs. Producer.
To promote good intentions, nature and friendship must be combined with knowledge of the craft if one is to tell a credible story.
That didn't work out in this case.
There's a little bit too much eroticism and a minimum of passion for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as a commercial for canister therapy, this amateur-themed piece wouldn't pass.
Yeah, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and you can see how you understand that shit, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, unless they want to, the answer is always no.
If you'd listened to these kids all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's work like any other, in this case a profit-making brigade.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"Almost no rainfall during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual", the Israeli Meteorological Service confirms.
For example, the village of Kfar Gilead in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term average rainfall in November.
So this week's two-day rainfall was more of an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It's also the right Christmas scene, the Nazarene Wasim Ashkar enjoyed.
The rains in Israel come almost exclusively in the winter months, are bumpy and irregular.
Winter rain is a forest addiction.
Without them, they're dry and prone to fire.
It's not just forests, it's also drinking water supplies and farmers' supply.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, has been filled to the brink this spring, thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
Water managers have warned of drought long ago.
It is expected that rainfall may decrease, depending on global warming and climate change, ur ur ur ur ur ur ur Schor, a spokesperson for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel is able to use technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Worse, economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are at risk.
Tank cars are on the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman.
The water and private wells are drying up.
"This year, my orders have increased by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years", said Imad Suleiman, a tanker driver in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was the drought.
The local riverbed was completely drained.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares a military strike against Iran
The Israeli Defense Minister said that the Vienna talks had not brought any progress and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a possible military strike on Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who lives in the US, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he's also informed Washington about military preparations.
At a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had not brought any progress and world powers understood that the Iranians were playing with them.
That's what happened to me about three years ago.
I liked the lady a little bit and I barbecued during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
I finally found out that my suspicions about the pyramid were justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I kept the missus in doubt and questioning for a while, and then I thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm a jerk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, with plenty of snow and good weather waiting for them.
The Czech ski resort experienced the first major rally of skiers this weekend.
After a heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no emergency snow and some ski resorts have started operating as a result.
The master also did not waive the obligation to prove that the train has a COVID certificate.
While the operators do not complain of customer disinterest, some ski equipment rental companies report weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberec region took to the race tracks and the slopes over the weekend.
The skiers wished for the sunny weather and excellent snow conditions.
"We are pleased, the opening weekend has really come from the Friday night skiing, when we had our first skiers on the hill", said sports centre director Szjed Jakub Hanush.
Hundreds of people have gone to the autumn skiing weekend for the first time in the new season.
They had, for example, the Karlov Ski Arena or the centre in Branné in Šumpersko.
The weekend was very decent, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday.
The conditions are perfect.
Today, the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, not to spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in the Rostislav Walk.
Ski area operators may only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or who are in the post-covid-19 disease phase.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared to do so and prove they have the necessary documents, said René Hronesch of the Spindler's Mill ski centre.
"We've only recorded units of incidents", he added.
Some rental and ski equipment stores report lower interest than before the pandemic.
Luckily, the interest in skiing is high.
It's not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Bokiš of Skiopava's shop in Opava.
More pressure is expected during the skiing season.
Also, Snowbear King's Owner David Shintack feels that due to Covid, the rental of ski equipment is not as much of an interest as it used to be.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are about 50 percent, said CTV Shintak.
He said people have become lazy with the pandemic and have learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the demand for rentals in the Novako area on the Divine Gift is high.
The ski rental began a week ago and those interested must now order them in advance.
"We're starting to borrow the racetracks this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year", said Pavlina Novakova, the site's operator.
She said that the same interest as before the epidemic was also expressed in the ski school.
If we want the successful and wealthy to stay abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
Socialist health care is certainly not one of them, where it is not often possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and smart people go abroad, who have no assets here.
The owner of the company doesn't just go abroad.
I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a reasonable future vision in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
The emigration from Hungary started with Orbán winning one beautiful day, he ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position day after day.
The next question is the election.
If he's living here like a fool, some traditional V4 nutcase can win here too.
The young and educated will leave, his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane will remain.
That's a scary picture!
Langmajer in blood for betting on beer?
While in the Czech Republic it was a full-fledged fall, in Thailand the staff of the Island film, led by Jiří Langmajer (55), enjoyed the tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is this a real injury or is this a shooting scene?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all her behavior and we're starting to worry about her", Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and they just want to know where she is", she continued.
The missing Czech woman reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to the British media, Srnc worked as a nurse's assistant at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing", a group of medical facilities tweeted.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police", the statement continued.
Member Harriet Harman, who spoke on Saturday at a press conference, is also calling on the public to cooperate.
"She's been missing for days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death", said the Labour politician, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by London police.
"I feel we all have a particularly big responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family and working here for our healthcare", Harman said.
Police have previously detained a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC news website, the police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not capable of occupying Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't appreciate Ukraine like that either.
That's not a "huge amount", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and our entry is beginning to get full.
I quoted above.
I don't know what made you think Russia wanted war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Comparing the situation in 38 is so out of line that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare that to the first Punic war and the Sicilian annexation.
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not abide by the Minsk agreement, Russia would annex these ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the border concentration would be like.
It's the pacta sunt servanda...
New routes in Prague will be in effect from Sunday, mainly on suburban services
Passengers in Prague's integrated transport (PID) will expect several changes from Sunday, particularly for suburban services.
New lines have emerged, some have changed course, and some have vanished.
The newly integrated system is being implemented by the Republic of Moldova.
In the capital, since Sunday, the speed trains from České Budějovice stop at the Garden City station.
In the suburban rail transport, S7 trains depart from Beroun to Český Brod, passing through the Prague main station.
The newly operated Prague-Zahradní Město station will be the new stop for the R17 motorway from Český Budějović and Benešov.
The PID will be further extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Świetła nad Sazawą, Blatna u Jesenice, Stare Slavovice and Turnov.
Buses will be operated to Mladoboleslavsk, including lines to the Libereck and Královéhrádské regions.
77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operational lines will be operational.
From Prague, Zličina, a new bus line 405 will depart and go to Žatce.
A new direct link to Prague  Kralovice near Rakovník was also established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
The power will be increased at the morning peak and the weekend will be connected from Prague to Rakovník, when the new express line number 404 will start.
The new PID system includes lines 400 and 410 for the Liberec region.
They leave from the Střížkov metro station, not from the Holešovica reservoir.
The 400-line line passes through Mělník, Dubou and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected links continue to Rumburka or Cvikova.
Supplementary line 410 goes through the Plow and the Dub to the Docks, Mimon and Jablonny in Podještady.
On the contrary, new services are cancelled or restricted on a dozen Central Czech local routes, including Mochova, Dobříš and Rožmital pod Tremšín.
All trains leaving Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernisation of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the Prague  Beroun, Prague  Lysá over Labem and around Cologne.
Changes are also awaiting passengers elsewhere.
Buses will replace some of the cancelled railway lines or the section will be extended to line 420 from Dobříš with a link from Prague, where PID tickets to Milevsk can be used.
The routes 540 to 543 in Nymbursk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Horovicka in the Plzeň region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break, and my only option to get food is to go to Billy's next door or a little further up to Lidl.
Since I have no exercise, no strength to exercise after work, I must eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy, and I'm quick to get a pizza noodle and a snack of yogurt and apples.
Question: What healthy, heat-free product would you recommend I buy at the supermarket?
Not everyone waits for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about trees you have to see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If it decays, the tree may be more prone to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason they're forbidden us to drive off the freeway, but it's one of them.
Darren's confession about his relationship with Snow White:
The Czech show business pimp has been living on nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dary Rolins and Pavel Nedved since Friday.
They've been together for years, a famous football player even got divorced for a singer.
Dara has now sent a message to her fans explaining why she kept her love a secret for six months.
"I'd like to say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed Dara's bear catch, which is, excuse me, Nedvida", jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer to her ears.
He said he packed her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and while they're used to the public interest, they're not happy about it.
And here it is.
What we both didn't expect, but we knew it would happen, the singer goes on.
I just don't know who's worse off.
If it's those who don't care and jump out of the can and get caught, or us who are looking into their lives.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend were fit enough, or insisted that everyone really know the list of your ex-partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's a lot of fun, you know, and that's what's wrong with Dara.
The two met in Italy, where Rolins was traveling to prepare her new fashion collection.
The bear is the vice president of Juventus football club.
They only came out with the truth now because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be finalized.
My wife, Ivan, and I have been separated for three years, but they've only been married for three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us well, we thank you.
We're just people, too. We have families, children, a past, dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have the right hearts.
And that's why I love my new husband, and just as he is with me, I am with him, for better or worse, Rolins concluded.
Hey, the other commenters probably said everything, but I'm just saying that college is great at the beginning, my classmates usually meet and make friends during the first semester or two, and then they get a place to rent together, which I think is the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments don't usually advertise too long in advance, so you probably won't find much right now, but it's definitely not gonna hurt to look at the offer.
Otherwise, you can avoid not only Ceylon but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Frenchka, etc., that's a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jewish quarter are a bit of a ghetto.
The Squirrel Quarter, on the other hand, is a lot of student territory, King's Field, and that's a good direction, and it's close to most of the VUT faculties.
I've never been a hired hand, but I'm a native Brno, so I can maybe advise Brno as such if you're still missing any information.
That's an example of perfectly normal thinking.
Because of what a few doctors in Poland have decided to do, it's actually quite okay that the state doesn't fund enough schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or they go after the state and pay for it.
After all, we can't let a private actor control a piece of education just because he's going to spend a few crowns on a full government contribution and that means he can learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement is somewhat weightless when written by a man who two days earlier expressed himself in this way about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced in cataloging/digitalisation that (and even longtime professionals) either get it out of sight or write something in the xxx*** or ... (according to convention) and in a note that it's unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
I'd probably deal with that in a note, personally, depending on the program you're using.
If you want to be a decent, hardworking student, you can look into some character databases and find the closest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess that the author or printer simply created their own character that fits with what's physically on the coin.
PS: Is it not more of an Odry Kingdom than an Odry Kingdom?
PSS: Someone's already broken your heart.
Look at the comment with FILH.
Politicians don't even know what the "theme" of our presidency is.
That's a lot worse than having an interpreter with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one understood the text is ridiculous.
All the important documents are word-for-word examined, but some basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the job of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, and English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for the establishment of high-level relationships.
And the English language is quite interesting, after the UK's exit from the EU.
I don't understand the heat on Ceil.
I've been working there for three years now, and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive home from work at 10 p.m. and never have any problems?
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely stepped in there in his life.
Yeah, I think most of Brno's Roma population lives there, but all they do is block the sidewalks and park where they don't have them.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to downtown, I'd be happy to go.
There are lots of newly renovated or newly built apartments.
Felix Slovak (78) without Dad and Gelem's mistress like a pole in a fence!
Who's he gonna spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people at the Advent crown lit their first candle, Felix the Slovak didn't.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there's nothing to light.
I saw the crown of a father, and Lucie must have one, said the saxophonist to the Lightning, who confirmed Patras's words that he visits her often.
He's visiting, but he's not staying at their house in Vinegarade, where Dad was left alone after he left.
The dictionary still doesn't know where he's going to be on Christmas Eve.
I recently met with Annika, Felix and both of my grandchildren.
The film is about the life of Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelemová.
Felix the Slavic and Lucie the Gelemova:
But we were still talking, so Christmas didn't come.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy presents all the time, and I'm sure I'll buy something for Grandpa and Lucia, like perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to christen the music video at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone to hang out with, says the Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife of Saturday's madman Adrian or the singer Kamil Nyvlta.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot to not occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know of any other file that could be deployed in hospitals in times of crisis.
There are few police officers and they can't afford it, so are firefighters and nowhere else is there such a high percentage of medical trained people at this level.
And that our military is capable of defending Ostrava is only going to the head of the previous governments, not the army, who have been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
The agricultural subsidies need to be changed, the landscape should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in years.
Water has decreased in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, scientists say, and less precipitation is recorded in places where humidity has not been a priority.
Climate change is the cause of the drought in much of central Europe.
But the effects also reinforce the way we handle the soil.
What should we prepare for in the face of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine, I can barely keep up with ice skating, I know what hockey is, and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hallucination.
And whether you're a Russian Bear or a Chinese Lama hockey team, losing by two goals, even if you don't have to win a game at all costs, is different than being tied.
But the way I listen to Czech commentators who poke, what the referees notice they don't notice whether it's men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but it's probably the same with all sports, UEFA and the Italian players or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And for them, if it were the other way around, it's like it's always been, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than they've won, I think it would be a classic "they lost" vs. "we won".
Coronavirus: In Russia, the number of infected has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily cases.
5,766 people are hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, 74 more.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic in 1967 to 100,000, 871 to 100,000 in the last week.
The number of cases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new cases have been registered.
That's the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered cases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since late October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infection caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK's Health and Safety Executive, said on television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Those infected with the omicron are already in hospital in the UK, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
No deaths have been reported so far, but hospitalisations occur about 14 days after infection and deaths about three weeks after infection.
UK Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Downing Street Christmas quiz last December, when a lockdown was imposed and Christmas parties were banned.
A Johnson cabinet minister claimed the quiz was conducted virtually, via a computer.
But it was attended by a group of employees in Downing Street gathered around computers.
Pressure is mounting in Britain to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was imposed in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers organized numerous meadows despite the lockdown.
The British public and media are furious that Johnson and his government have been making fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV commercial television editor for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the general election by a landslide.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from office as prime minister.
Remarkable how quickly events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting elections in the spring that could end the twelfth year of Viktor Orbán's rule.
It will be an election of European significance.
How long can they be expected to be fair?
They're not gonna be fair.
They're probably not even free, because they weren't free in the last two Orbán elections.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and makes other tricks, bigger or smaller.
The last one, so far, is that practically anyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fides to bind voters from selected districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying, they're not gonna be fair at all.
Do you think it's gonna be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is quite different.
It used to be about how much and whether Fidesz won a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will win more votes and mandates.
It's a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power playing harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, a video leaked to independent media by the Speaker of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövéra, explaining to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news stories.
It all starts with the tongue.
I've been beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, neither do I, my dad has a long one, but then he explodes extremely (just about me).
I was also very cholera-ridden and I got so angry as a little girl, I was lying on the floor in a convulsion and all blue, I was taken in the shower about twice to calm down.
Sometimes they slapped me in the nursery, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to handle things violently now, too, because when I was little I was pretty hard-working, now I hit myself to at least beat something up, and when I was younger I was like, "I'm a parent, I'm a hand-welding person, so I don't get too much over my fist", so I never do anything extreme, but I always feel the urge.
I can't tell you how much of a blast this is, but I'm sure education has a role to play.
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating kids is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't educational anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up, maybe it's not possible not to sweat their kids a little, so I don't blame them.
I don't mind. I don't understand why the O.P. should be ashamed of anything.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
I would call Kundas those who make laws of this quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a pay cut?
You can really count on people wanting and buying a product and you're gonna have to pay off the mortgage with what?
The monstrous world of Kochner.
Where will Slovakia move the case of the murderers of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main character is being tried in the trial of the four accused of the murders of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It has been a catalyst for civil society, but it has also exposed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Kočner and his connection to top Slovak politics and justice.
What major breakthrough will the process mean for Slovakia?
This is a huge amount of money for journalists.
How is it that this petition received a lot more media attention than the anti-deans petition from all medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they got fooled and the company got away with it.
There was a death on Czech TV with Covid six months ago.
Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of warehouses nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlicek needs to be fundamentally reworked
Prime Minister Andrey Babiš's government is at an end and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens were respected in the selection and authorisation of deep-sea storage of highly radioactive waste still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has suspended the discussion of a proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of surveys.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the communities concerned associated with the Deep Storage Platform but also with the Cities and Communities Union of the Czech Republic.
The law will also provide for a significant increase in the capacity of local authorities to decide on the storage area promised to mayors since the first work on the legislation began in 2011, as required by the Czech Atomic Energy Act and European Directives.
We expect the new government to work on the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities, in line with its coalition agreement.
The proposed law from Minister Karl Havlic, who has the Platform at his disposal, is particularly critical of the municipalities: the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process for the location of the storage site is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in the location.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the warehouse administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal for a substantive intention almost completely omits public involvement and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statists in the authorisation procedures.
The proposal lacks a systematic set of compensation for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a storage location, authorising it and operating it.
In reality, according to current legal standards, local authorities have little choice in defending the interests of their citizens when looking for a storage space.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the authority or the minister in whose interest the authorisation is granted shall decide.
The action shall have no effect on the conduct of research or construction work.
The principle of self-determination that the Platform calls for is commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those which have already made progress in permitting storage, such as Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is also another failure of the State administration, which hires external law firms to draft legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. concluded by SURRAO and following on from contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
The total amount of these works is expected to be about 4 million kroner, according to the Contracts Register.
Antonín Seknička, Mayor of the municipality of Cejle in the town of Hrádek and spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: "After the industrial ministers who have only shifted the alignment of the position of the authorities with the state authorities in search of a deep storage of highly radioactive waste to their successors, we expect a significant turnaround from the new government.
We're offering a helping hand.
We also thank the League of Cities for their support, which sees the problem of the lack of rights of municipalities in such essential buildings as the municipalities directly affected in selected locations.
The anti-depositing platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to promote a change in the State's approach to the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform furthermore insists that the decision to select a location for possible storage is subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman, 69, lost 90 kg.
Although he had not needed to change his lifestyle for years, he was eventually intimidated by doctors.
They told him if he didn't lose weight, he'd die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He boasted of his new character in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat kid from the sitcom Roseanne is a whole different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family had asked him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
"I put it all in my mouth", the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
I wanted to do it slowly this time.
Move, exercise. I can do that.
I'm getting to the age where I can't afford to sit anymore, Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also matters what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss".
If it's some kind of platform text that's waiting for readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, a college text, I'd probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are more types of bosses for everything.
Maybe a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, so "boss" is something like a master/ruler given level, and then there's the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there's Half-Life games where the bosses are, but the player runs away with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called that at all?
Well, then there's the mini bosses.
It's not possible to translate the boss in a single word, but the Czech and other languages do not solve it (interesting is Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It's simply a story or game that's generally significant, computer-controlled, an opponent stronger than all previous ones, and watching to complete some level or task.
The whole world is searching for Peter of London who's missing.
The Czech police have been involved.
The missing Peter Srnc has been wanted by the British police since December 3.
The Czech police were involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uhrskhoradišť has been looking for her since December 7.
He also helps the British police through Interpol.
The Czech woman, Petra Srnsova, was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circle for her.
So the whole world is looking for Peter.
"Czech police are working closely with the British police", police spokeswoman Katerina Rendlová confirmed.
"We share information on the case together", she added.
The reported search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
He says she's 5'8" tall, skinny, brown eyes, and long straight hair of the same color.
She should be from the Uhrskhoradiště.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London's hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because this kind of disappearance is very unusual for her.
The local congresswoman Harriet Harman joined in the search for Peter.
She got involved in the leaflets with Petra's face.
"We have a huge concern about her", she said at a press conference Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
It's unclear who he was or what he had in common with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While October data showed a slight decline in attacks, last month, as the year drew to a close, attacks intensified significantly.
We've seen a major campaign involving Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The attackers' strategy remains the same for now.
The infected email attachment is intended to draw the user's attention by a title that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month there was a dangerous attachment in the name of the word invoice, this time it was marked as a copy of the 11,2021...exe bill", said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware contains features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex email clients.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last major campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the holidays approaching and the end of the year, the attackers' activity is rising again.
In November, the Formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case are not specifically targeting the Czech Republic and security specialists in November caught a campaign with global reach.
Compared to October's data, the Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still accounts for nearly a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued continuously for a month with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The Formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe appendix, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the account still appears.
The Czech annex may then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and a dampening of activity is recorded by security analysts at Fareit, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and has not had a major campaign of attacks in the Czech Republic in the past few months.
That smart-ass thing today that doesn't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The Prague march was bigger than the media reports.
Based on the shore parade footage and my experience as a demonstrator, I'm not afraid of an estimate of 10,000 people.
People in the parade have filled the shore and the bridge and the opposite shore communications.
That means a lot of people.
A spontaneous march of some 4,000 demonstrators brings with it an unprecedented number of passers-by.
I'm saying something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokry.
That the continued discontent of several large groups or layers of the population led to their finding common ground.
Only anti-vaxers, anti-Russian and unions alone could not fill or pay for such a large parade.
The actions of the Dogs of the Cage Association are rising in popularity, reminding me of a million moments for democracy upside down.
Sometimes I get the impression they're renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of movement this discontent could pay off, depending not only on the money being delivered, but whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine will become four more doses.
It's definitely not a left-wing or center-wing movement, I bet you can.
The triple dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose one, because obviously we're going to have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant science action that humanity is rightfully proud of.
The end of the road, Bulgaria has a new Prime Minister announcing change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has ordered the formation of a new government by Kiril Petkov of the anti-corruption Movement We Go Forward, which won the November elections.
This has already been achieved by forming a broad coalition government which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the last government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost the election.
However, the victorious parties, which declared a fight against bribery and abuse of power, could not reach an agreement, so two more early elections followed.

The secret footage is a global hit.
In Britain, concerns have been growing over the weekend about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech, who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srnc was last seen two weeks ago on her way home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, the employer or MP of the children's hospital, representing the part of London where she lived, is also calling for information about the employee.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all her behavior and we're starting to worry about her", Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnc worked, said in a video Saturday.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is very worried about her too and they just want to know where she is", she continued.
The missing Czech woman reportedly left work around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday, November 28th and headed home to the Camberwell neighborhood.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
She was reported missing on December 3 by one of her associates.
According to the British media, Srnc worked as a nurse's assistant at Evelyn London Children's Hospital, which is part of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing", a group of medical facilities tweeted.
"We would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that could help find her to contact the police", the statement continued.
The shopper's amateur painter of children's rooms, Zdenka Dvořáková Kocourková (and also the regional pirate council) revealed anonymously that she was violating copyright with her paintings.
But the court found that the paintings of the Crab in the shoe room did not violate the law.
In the Lab Mountains, there was a moon-hole in the road, a channel with no roof.
It was a loss of life.
The magistrate referred the complaint to the road's DHS, and because it didn't respond, the hole was still there.
Finally, authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership and after a month the RSD began to deal intensively with the situation.
