Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in EU countries/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which confirm that, although the levels vary by country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that around 80% of COVID-19 patients have mild respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these patients recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease and requires hospital treatment, while the other 6% of cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we looked at the cumulative COVID-19 incidence trends of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and compared them with incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has experienced further geographic spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first European with a confirmed COVID-19 case based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with those dates included, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by each country worldwide is updated daily at 8.00 a.m. This figure is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
The data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy for the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of the delayed 14 days, so taking into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, in the period 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported by each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the cases in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of the cumulative incidence of the 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, cumulative incidents of COVID-19 started to rise around 21 February, then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (Additional Part).
This trend is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar cumulative COVID-19 incidence trends (Additional Part).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases that was comparable to the total number of cases in Italy three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative incidents of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable rate across all countries.
This is despite differences in levels experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region have reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case admission data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level is only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, data should be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and medical care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and medical care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
A modelling scenario related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimated prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases for each EU/EEA country and UK associated with risk >90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
As cases are so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a population of a certain regional service coverage, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the level of the Regional Unit Designation for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very quickly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and the increased number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare, especially intensive care, as is the case in affected regions in Italy.
As demonstrated in recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessments, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt to the appropriate response if it is not implemented beforehand.
The rapid risk assessment also included public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available as the country has the possibility to further enhance its management efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on healthcare.
If it fails, other EU/EEA national healthcare systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters to humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more contagious and more prevalent in older people than in young people, and more prevalent in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing volume of publications on these emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the rapidly growing research subjects.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this survey will help us understand and address this threat to disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the new virus disease.
The virus is very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease that caused it is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients being returned and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the enemy of the public number 1 and has the potential to be more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 which established virus sequences isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, covering virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research in this rapidly growing new field of study.
As much as possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other COVID-related diseases, which are Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We'll also discuss what we've learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis and some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
Traditionally, CoV has been considered a nonlethal pathogen for humans, primarily causing about 15% of the flu 4.
Yet, in this century, we've found two highly pathogenic human-causing viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which each caused outbreaks that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with horrific morbidities and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third recorded COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
As shown in Feb. 1.1, clusters of pneumonia with unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequences were launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a healthcare provider infection was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, a provincial quarantine was imposed in Wuhan city and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered to be the initial location of infection from unknown animal sources.
On 30 January, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
At the time of this writing, the disease has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Heb. 2).
As the situation develops so rapidly, the end coverage and severity of the outbreak still have to be determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a multi-center study in 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated epidemiological overview (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at ages 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50, only a few are under 20, and only 14 infected are under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from incubation to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproduction figure (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the R0 is respectively 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, in line with the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large viral subfamily of sampled RNA containing a single strand of sense RNA.
CoVs can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoVs known to infect humans.
The coating of the spike (S) or spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and is then diluted to peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA accompanied by the envelope glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein forms vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type beta-CoV with genetic similarity of more than 99.98% among 10 samples that were sequentially sampled; the samples were taken from the origin location of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin part of the human respiratory tract's epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 more weakly than its binding to SARS-CoV S protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a non-severe infection of SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8 codes.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is composed of dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and midwife
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through the falcons and camels.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate hosts that help the virus cross species barriers to infect humans are still unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed that snakes be a virus carrier from bats to humans involving recombination of homologs in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that the ant-eating long-beaked mammal, the eel often used in traditional Chinese medicine, has the potential to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology to the CoV found in the eel and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the genome is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and a humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ethers, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, acetate acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reporting on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (February 4).
In general, after invading a host, a virus is recognized by the innate immune system through a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes a C-type lectin-like receptor, a Toll-like receptor (TLR), a NOD-like receptor (NLR), and a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis of type I interferon (IFN) which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune responses joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Auxiliary cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have recovered neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction produces a large amount of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, complex organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cluster of acne, is more common in older adults with the disease and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected, but symptom-free, people from transmitting the virus to others.
In general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and early symptom of COVID-19, with or without accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who experience fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and acute fever, even without lung imaging disorders, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a family cluster study and a cluster study caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throats (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and ventilation support was needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% from 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached a high of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 ranged only from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
The figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not match MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Cluster frames are often found in a family or from a group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks prior to admission.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from hospital can carry the virus again.
In the early stages, patients have a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L, and increased aminotransferase aspartate levels as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels increased in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood flow rates increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer, the fibrin-degrading product of blood, increase, and lymphocyte counts decrease progressively.
Thoracic photo-disability is found in a large proportion of COVID-19 patients and is characterized by bilateral convex shadows or ground-glass opasity in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbate gas exchange disruptions.
Pneumocytosis type I and type II dysfunction decreases surfactant levels and increases surface pressure thus decreasing the lung's ability to develop and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on thoracic photos often parallel the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte squamous discharge, formation of the hyalin membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multiple nucleated synaptic cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rates, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory testing, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a whip stick in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and convenience if verified on clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors mainly offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been previously used or proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential therapies with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are major threats to patients and leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a thermodified cardiopulmonary short-term technique used for the treatment of cardiac failure or life-threatening respiration.
In addition, electrolyte balance care, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to cause cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by a decrease in cytokine chain release, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are a major cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the management of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockage; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppression 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affect the prognosis.
However, short-term low-dose corticosteroid administration is recommended to be given with caution to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, there has not been a confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be beneficial in a COVID-19 patient from the United States.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, once again for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single stranded RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has prepared this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side effects may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions with other medicines used by patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from the healed patient and antibody production
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, recognize molecules unique to pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammation and viral load as well as an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification should be done to propose such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify the genetic code that binds the effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtration against proteins that are important to the virus.
This way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear as it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combination.
Currently, as effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not yet exist, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top recovery rates in the therapy of COVID-19 patients were observed in some Chinese provinces using TCM in 87% of their patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, these comparisons are still very rough because many other impact factors, such as patient numbers and severity, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine therapy (WM) alone with combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it took to recover from body temperature, to lose symptoms, and to be hospitalized was much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of symptomatic degradation (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanisms of work and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel very scared of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely, and angry.
Furthermore, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can cause increased anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which included depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor upheavals, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Tracking of contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects, and people who come into contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and often complement antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by virus emergence.
Efforts have been made to develop an S protein-based vaccine, which in the long term and effectively creates neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, the live-debilitated vaccine has been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in the elderly and lethal challenge models as well as their protection against zoonotic viral infections is yet to be determined before clinical trials begin.
This is probably because SARS declined 17 years ago and there have been no new cases reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic resources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, these difficulties are not easily overcome due to the long time to develop a vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, the new COVID-19 has begun to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the development of disease prognosis models is essential for healthcare bodies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in the age group of 30-65 years with 47.7% of patients over 50 years in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have participant comorbidity and complications and significantly older than patients in need of no intensive care (median age 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests age as a prognostic factor for the end result of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has also been reported to bind to ACE2-positive colangiosites, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can interact.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlations between CRP levels and severity as well as COVID-19 prognosis have also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatinine kinase (CK) may also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are the traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Thoracic photos and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other factors to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used as supportive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered extreme stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Long-term psychological counseling and support should be provided to help the patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomless symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause a cold.
Therefore, in the initial phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, a major effort is underway in China, which includes quarantine of Wuhan province and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of halting transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While this action has been devastating to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases has declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates state that the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-concussion bladder and throat of patients who had recovered and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier.
Nevertheless, promising signs are showing up in China, seen from the decline in the number of new cases, which suggests that the current strategy may work.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half as many deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally managed.
Also, it is possible that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappear or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
Comparisons of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics are given below (February 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be transmitted through direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the faeces, which led to the possibility of new transmission, fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who happen to have contact with a patient or an infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series numbers 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks ensure that the spark of fluid from potentially infected people does not follow the air or stick to the surface of the material, where the spark can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series numbers 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion being fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, healthcare providers who contact the patient directly must wear N95 (series number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate insulation cloaks to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected districts, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is believed to be adequate to keep the patient at a distance.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high homologousity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should serve as a major warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured the population by saying that the new virus has low propagation properties and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and that prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
The message soothes the public's fears, especially as the entire state prepares for the Spring Festival, until this critical time is too late to curb the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, these bodies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorized officials; (3) be more restrictive in order to curb the potential of epidemics at an early stage, and not try to calm the public; and (4) more often produce targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of disease epidemics and to periodically test and improve community response systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries worldwide at the time of this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has a recurrent SARS outbreak.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to contain the epidemic and manage patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly than young people and more men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part the reason why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may result in negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can return positive results from the virus test.
This finding greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the 96% genetic homology found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we still have not been able to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What kind of animal is the intermediate species for transmitting viruses from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers number one and two, we cannot effectively disconnect the transmission and the outbreak can spread again at any moment.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origins suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and result in further pathological changes?
Does the virus bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How do viruses evolve genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemic become a global pandemic, end like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but they may take time to find.
However much it costs, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human cov (hcov) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as smallpox.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) turned things upside down and revealed how highly destructive and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has made the CoV a highlight again and surprised us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its sister, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis, so understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs will be beneficial for us.
Most HCoVs are derived from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir of several HCoVs has also been identified.
The identification of the animal host has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
Research of CoV-infection interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and genomic recombination.
The 2019 COVID-19 disease epidemic is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transition and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity were also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of single-stranded, positively charged, and enveloped RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome at 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoVs", because of its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on their structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar layouts.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap. Both are translated into replicating polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein undergoes further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open reading frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a thong or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complement proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoVs and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the primary reservoir for gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human co-viruses (HCoVs).
Of the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as fever and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation outside the lung organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the intestines of acute patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, it was a widely accepted concept that HCoV infections were generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurred.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus epidemic disease (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
There is considerable evidence to support the evolution of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs adapt well and are nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has created tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Zoonotic tracing of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motive power, and restrictive factors for the occurrence of interspecies transfer.
The study could also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediates, and amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in preventing future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoV.
We specifically highlighted and discussed a common topic that the HCoVs' parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trends of HCoVs that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The end result of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoV has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first strain of HCoV-229E B814 from the intestines of patients infected with measles, various CoVs were isolated from a variety of infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cattle, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited seizure symptoms, which included headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throats, accompanied by fever and cough that is seen in 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequential serial lines in the mammalian cerebrum.
The clinical description of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to infections caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a sickness period of about two weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed mild seizures.
Only a few patients with weakened immune systems show a low-weight respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV-associated pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super contagion, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation times of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load seen on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, lethargy, and dizziness, followed by dyspnea, cough, and respiratory distress as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatinine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophageal growth have also been observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also become infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially in patients with weak immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of zero-patient relatives travelling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a huge effort has been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7-month-old children from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus is initially very common in young children, the elderly, and vulnerable patients who suffer from respiratory diseases.
Exposures to coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the same virus isolation from nasal specimens of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of general respiratory disease and peaks occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory illness.
These four community HCoVs have been fully adapted to humans and generally have a low chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, such as in the case of the HCoV-NL63 subtype more virulent which was recently reported to cause a severe respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, as the ability to move efficiently and maintain self-defense in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of these HCoVs also decreases.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute renal failure, which so far is the only case of MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with high case fatalities, at 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to man.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients that were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case mortality rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted, the death rate in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the death rate outside Hubei was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a manifestation of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea has also been found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their high nucleotide sequence homology, at 82%, they both group into different phylogenetic tree branches.
The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may be contributing to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation time and the duration of the HCoV disease journey are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 followed the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more general picture seen in Community HCoV infections, which includes a picture of mild or even symptomless nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infection even at a slightly lower ratio.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting pattern characteristics, having similarities to community HCoV as well as SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the decreased transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 after several human patches still needs to be verified, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, is yet to be clarified by further studies".
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs.
However, the outlook for SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenicity, and continued spread in multiple lines in humans, will have a major impact on the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been the surviving species of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans suffering from severe HCoV disease have been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations to fight off host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-based CoVs have spread to the human population and triggered seizures in immunocompetent people.
The virus doesn't need an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not yet adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
Both must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs as well as seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar descriptions to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like community HCoVs, at least for now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoVs and is not pathogenic to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal host or intermediate.
Before we discuss the origin of HCoVs, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifying HCoVs.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have close relatives and share a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral viruses usually adapt well and are nonpathogenic in these hosts.
Similarly, the reservoir hosts carry HCoVs continuously and over long periods of time.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
On the other hand, if the new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not yet adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
These intermediate mothers can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying host by allowing viruses to temporarily replicate, then transmit it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoVs can become stunted if they cannot defend their transmission in the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data reveal in retrospect that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies indicated that the animal sellers had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
The moon-dwarf (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no further SARS cases have been reported since all the mosquitoes in the market were killed.
However, it has been reported that lunar moose from wildlife or farms not exposed to the live animal market largely give negative test results for SARS-CoV. This suggests that lunar moose may only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that it is possible that many small mammal species also serve as hosts of SARS-CoV intermediate amplification.
All of these hosts appear to be end-users of SARS-CoV.
A further search of natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV revealed a close-related bat CoV, called the SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 bat CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese equine bats.
The bat tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
This and other bat CoVs share a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts to newly emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat feces samples were shown to use ACE2 in bats, foxes, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum of a convalescent SARS patient can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not hosts of the direct reservoir SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, called peptidase 4 diluted (DPP4), as a virus entryway.
The MERS-CoV dependent-RNA polymerase RNA sequence is phylogenetically closer to its homology in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% homology of nucleotide sequences.
Therefore, bats may not be the direct reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that Arab camels give a seropositive result to specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, similar to camels native to the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-CoVs are living viruses identical to those found in humans isolated from the nasal mucus of Arabian camels.
It is also important to note that a massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms was observed in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels penetrate the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decomposition from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to onset of symptoms, the possibility of human-to-human transmission or unknown route of transmission involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish a maternal relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless a nearly identical bat CoV is discovered later.
It is likely that the host of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal is among the wildlife species sold and killed at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of small endangered mammals, known as the prawns (Manis javanica), may also carry an ancestral beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new strain of CoV shares 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as closely related to RaTG13 with 90% similarity in nucleotide sequence rate.
They are grouped into two sub-lineages of virus-like SARS-CoV-2 in phylogenetic trees, one sharing a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2, with amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Remarkably, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the rate of homology of the entire genome sequence is higher.
Previous studies on sick prawns also reported detection of viral contig from a lung sample, which was also found to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methodologies of preparation and manual curating to produce partial genome sequences comprising about 86.3% of the complete virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the ant is one of the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 mid-life.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the strain due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the strain-related beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 relatives.
The evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, termites, and other mammals is yet to be determined.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 strain-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the genome-wide sequence level.
It is highly speculative to say that the high level of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 strain and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The comparative hypothesis supports recombination between the beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 strain and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination occurs widely among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have not yet been able to determine the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-colored bats shows close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, current knowledge of the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of historical occurrence of interspecies transmission of HCoV.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from livestock to infect humans, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Bat-related alpha-CoVs of HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there's an alpha-CoV alpaca.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may be in contact with bats in the shared ecological loop.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpaka alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-alpha-CoVs are not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas get the alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Other possibilities are that while bat alpha-CoVs serve as a shell of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and Arab camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from early identification of the virus and was also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a host of viral species that are rich in interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, tightly-fused colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying ability are all conditions that support bats to be the ideal 'virus transmitter'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arab camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of termites, if any, in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the strawberry beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in strawberries.
The squirrel may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoV relative, similar to the mosquito in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be considered or excluded.
First, bats may have been a reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2's related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological slopes with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the cranberry could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts for the recently introduced SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is likely that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody tests on pets and wildlife should be done.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in third species that come into contact with both bats and prawns.
Animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors from the viral side are also important to facilitate the CoV crossing species barriers.
First, the relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoV can be considered sed to high with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per site, depending on the adaptation phase of CoV to the new host.
CoV has corrective exoribonuclease, elimination that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir nucleotide analogues are known to suppress the replication of CoV through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of mutation of the CoV is about a million times higher than the rate of mutation of its host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not yet adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoVs that have a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, indicating a higher rate of adaptation in humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true for MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arab camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly render vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genomes in CoVs provide extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by a number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique selective-copy mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing vessels, strand transitions frequently occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can recombine to form new CoVs.
Evidence of natural recombination phylogenetic has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral-infected interactions in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interactions with host receptors are another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a special example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and mouse SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is thought to have rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
Generally, the RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensively targeted for host antibody responses.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its receptor as a virus entryway.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, foxes, rats, and raccoon dogs, thus enabling the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only six amino acid residues have been observed to differ between human and mosquito virus isolates in RBD and four of them are located in receptor binding patterns for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV fox has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the proton-shaped protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be essential for the human adaptation of the virus.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein implies that the affinity of binding of S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed an affinity of binding of human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to know whether there are other receptors that may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part in S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-thrasethylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this adaptation of the CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its host host.
In addition to the cell receptors, the end result of interspecies transmission of HCoV is also regulated by other host dependence and restriction factors.
These host protein differences between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be barriers to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependence factor and break down the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in these important viral-mother interactions still have to be identified and characterized.
Impartial genomic filtration to look at the dependence factors and restrictions of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using the latest CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCoVs emerging: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoV acts as a scaffold for the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein-cyanising gene has the potential to drastically modify the virus phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV bat viruses have been found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a characteristic elimination characteristic of 29 nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the beginning of human epidemics.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombination regions identified in RNA polymerase-dependent RNAs.
Recombination locations have also been identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partially nsp14.
Similarly, recombination events between different lineages have been shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may play a role in unintended changes in the viral genome, most likely due to the release of the virus from the selection stress it undergoes, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While whole ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows single nucleotide insertion resulting in skeletal shifts.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV was also driven by selective pressure in its reservoir hosts.
Mild or symptomless symptoms are detected when bats are infected with CoV, indicating a mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a failure to activate the proinflammatory response in bats would efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression of major class I histocompatibility complex molecules.
In addition, the high reactive oxygen species (ROS) rates from the bat's high metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonuclease to such an extent that selective pressure is put on the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new protein or protein features for host adaptation.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
The CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret lies to the presence of the uncommon carrier and the cause of the severe cases of human infection.
Symptoms are severe mainly due to over-activation of the immune response as well as cytokine storm, with lung damage becoming more severe if the immune response becomes stronger.
In contrast, in symptomless carriers, the immune response is already free of CoV replication.
The same strategies to determine the linkage of immune responses may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory enzyme in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, bat CoVs that share 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2 have been found.
Although mosquitoes and other animals in the market were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
A highly homologous strawberry beta-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 has been found, suggesting that the strawberry may have acted as one of the intermediate hosts or the strawberry beta-CoV may have contributed a gene fragment to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either intentionally or accidentally.
CoV has been re-focused on the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and mosquitoes in wet markets, it is possible that the closure of wet markets and the killing of all mosquitoes in them effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the cranberry should be moved from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several cranberry beta-CoV lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to humans through termites and other mammals are yet to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in Arab camels for a long time.
The camels served as an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot kill all camels to control MERS, as we did in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can eliminate the virus, a new genotype could emerge and cause an outbreak.
A variety of zoonotic cov are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the zoonotically-potential CoV of bats is highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of wild animal feeding in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparedness and control plans must be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have been around the planet for a long time.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if humans are bred to avoid wild animals.
Continuous monitoring of mammals needs to be carried out to better understand the ecology of the CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep a distance from the ecological loop of the zoonotic virus' natural reservoir.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral virus to the prawn, the conditions when bats and prawns share ecological slopes are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans communicate with bats should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that actually acts as an intermediate host, the way that the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and termites, should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infection and surveillance should be done.
Whether bats, prawns, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuing research in this area will delineate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and handling of the 2019 new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also continually being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for both expected and confirmed cases based on the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide has been published online in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also continually being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Management Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts substantially changed.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced a proposal for a modest score based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidelines and is a valuable reference for the pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and the latest studies.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case a combination of one epidemiological history overview with two clinical manifestations is required to make a comprehensive analysis, or fulfillment of three clinical manifestations is required if no clear epidemiological history is present:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other community where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients who have a fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other community where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as homes, offices, school classrooms, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts indicate normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts at the initial stage of development.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire virus genome indicating high homogeneity for a known new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or change of IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or a ≥4fold increase in titer at recovery phase above the rate in acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acid in a sample of respiratory or blood vessels was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on ongoing research by researchers to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood drawings, which increase the availability of various specimens, and support the participation of certain positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that warns us to be vigilant with patients with and without symptoms.
Therefore, the flow charts of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as low risk.
The scoring system will also need to be verified in future clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend following and adhering to the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported total cases of infection recorded including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases living at home.
There were 17 deaths.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two cases were between 51 and 60, and one case was between 41 and 50.
It also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital office told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader said public transport will be suspended longer than previously planned, until next Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown has been in place since March 26 and is scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential medicinal goods, fuel, and food is still allowed.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three were cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infections have surpassed one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection with SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day as Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia suffered its first coronavirus death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few remaining free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand reported cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there have been more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the territorial quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin has stated that Russians will remain unpaid until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extends the night time in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the full day; previously, the night time only occurred between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement night time between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia lowered the purchase limit of toiletries per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian retail chains Woolworth and Coles respectively lowered the purchase limit of toiletries to two and one pack per transaction in all stores nationwide.
ALDI also implemented a one-pack limit, on Monday.
The restrictions were announced as messages in the cash register and on his Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly piled up supplies out of fear of COVID-19 in case the community had to go into self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The change follows the four-pack restrictions per transaction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In a media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales "surged sharply" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the number of packages allowed to two last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional preparations, while ALDI made preparations for special Wednesday promotional activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to increase the availability, but local government bodies' restrictions on truck delivery times made it a mystery.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, as long as suppliers strive to meet demand, and less specific promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to having released pre-orders earlier, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills up the setup every night.
It emphasizes that toilet paper is a large-volume item so that the quantity of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes so much empty space on the shelves that the scarcity of items becomes felt.
Coles and Woolworths argued that if there were a lot of stuff on the shelves, if products like toiletries and sanitation could be bought and available in bulk, panic could be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Fabrics, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent, stressed they were working 24/7 to keep supplies, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some property sellers offered free toiletries to the first auctioneer in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held as buyers took a break for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet cloth.
Stores actually refused to impose restrictions, according to an Australian ABC report on March 3, they said they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, vacuum cleaners, dry foods, handwashing soaps, and flour.
Similarly outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toiletries to two packs containing 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to how far the disease has spread, not how dangerous the cases are, WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
If a country detects, tests, deals with, isolates, and mobilizes its citizens in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
We were very alert both to the alarming rate of spread and severity and to the alarming rate of slow action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has never happened before".
It said, in a report published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus".
It goes on to say, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be managed at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows a WHO decision in January that declared the outbreak a public health disorder that is affecting the world.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said of the outbreak, "at the core, the outbreak will get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World-Concerned Public Health Disorder on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, closing the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for suspected infected people.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, nighttime hours, workplace hazard management, and closure of facilities.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, sporting activities, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed both nationally and locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
The health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province), reported clusters of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is related to bat coronavirus, shingles coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later identified to have become ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear connection to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
Among the clusters of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have links to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a traceable case to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly rising in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has exceeded the number of new cases inside China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The chief scientific adviser to Great Britain, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population will need to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the base reproductive figure (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number is likely 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19 patients recovered.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death ranges from 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing health conditions, which included cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The actual fatality rate from COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures may not include people who die without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the total surplus mortality during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death calculation by a factor of 4-5 times.
A female spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual figure", a statement reinforced by non-scientific reports of overly low deaths in the U.S. Overly low deaths often appear in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy respectively.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and over time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate to cases was 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary by region.
In China, the estimated death rate to cases decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptomatic persistence from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptomatic persistence after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed to die from a particular disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the overall pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical survey that analyzed the impact of the measurement on CFR estimates.
WHO has asserted that the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and end of the epidemic duration are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University observed, "Without any control, infectious outbreaks usually slow down and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this time of when that will happen".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, likely for up to a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical restraints and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University observed, "I think it's unlikely that the coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, could disappear completely" and that the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The repeat virulence will depend on the group's immunity and the rate of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, tingling, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become severely ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including shortness of breath, chest tightness or stagnant chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bruising on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some people infected may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who have close contact with people confirmed infected should be closely monitored and screened to ensure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and symptom onset) typically ranges from 1 to 14 days, usually 5 days. For example, uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 patients who lose their sense of smell initially was 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has found that uncovered coughs can cause a droplet to push 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Breathing droplets may also be produced when breathing, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted through the air.
The droplet may fall into the mouth or nose of someone nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn the respiratory secretion into aerosols and then spread through the air.
It can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus may spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms are apparent and at further stage of disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few asymptomatic cases have been confirmed laboratory-specifically, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing research.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that viruses can be detected for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that may have already been touched by an infected person.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are associated with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by exposure to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
The virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two bat-derived strains.
The virus has a 96% similarity at the genome-wide level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the shingle virus and the human virus.
To date, a whole genome comparison has found that there is at most 92% similarity of genetic material between the coronavirus tick and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the tick is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately made through reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or bypass CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, these tests are performed on nasopharynx, but throat swabs can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these serological tests have been proven accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
In the US, serological testing developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Features of X-ray imaging and computed tomography (CT) imaging in people who are symptomatic include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging was faster and more sensitive so it was recommended to be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining a thorough personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing towels when coughing or sneezing and throwing away the towels directly into the garbage can.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical restraining measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various provinces have restricted or urged to stop all non-essential travel to and from countries and districts affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a level of community-scale spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers who treat people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with statements coming out from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance proximity to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive messages if they are close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are circulating; for example, washing the nose and flushing with flushing medication are ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after piercing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that destroys its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure disinfected for stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 6271%, isopropanol 50100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.27.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are any suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or childcare facilities, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bent elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, then immediately remove the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the spread of the expiratory droplets during speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch the face with inadequately clean hands, which is a major source of infection". Masks are also recommended for people treating others who may be suffering from the disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people treating COVID-19 patients, although WHO also acknowledges that wearing a mask can help prevent people from touching their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks on members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when in close proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks when using public transport or staying in public places.
The Thai health authorities urge people to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit their citizens from going out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the tower to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has mandated that passengers on inter-city trains and buses wear face masks by April 1.
Panama mandates the use of face masks every time outdoors, and recommends the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restraint (also called physical restraint) is an infection control action intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods of social restriction include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restraint methods by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments have imposed or imposed social restrictions in plague-stricken districts.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if no known COVID-19 spread in a province) to 50 people, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Elderly people and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disrupted immune systems who have a higher risk of serious illness and complications recommended the CDC to as much as possible at home only in areas with outbreaks at the community level.
The use of the term "social restraint" implies that people should be completely socially isolated and not encourage people to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
This recommendation includes encouraging sex only with people who live with you and do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments mandate or recommend self-quarantine for all populations living in affected districts.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for those in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been exposed to COVID-19 patients and people who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread COVID-19 spread are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategy in epidemic control is containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to track and isolate infected people as well as take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of disease, further efforts shift to mitigation levels: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the healthcare system and the community.
A combination of containment and mitigation actions can be performed simultaneously.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing policy reproduction rates to less than 1.Part of managing the epidemic of infectious diseases is seeking to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as lowering the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overuse in healthcare and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions to address the epidemic include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community-level measures aimed at physical restraint, such as closing schools and cancelling mass meeting events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental-level measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also implement various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who self-quarantine and imposes large fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and penalized medical preparation piles. Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) had major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce peak demand for healthcare by up to two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Suppression can be optional, but it must be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until vaccines are available, if this is first achieved), because otherwise, transmission will bounce back quickly as the measures of suppression are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have impacts on social and economic.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and resting can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be needed.
Steroid use can make the patient's condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also stated that some "traditional and home treatments" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a key step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and WHO regional offices in Europe have issued guidelines for primary health hospitals and services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care capacity by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known new coronavirus case was traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these animal species; or, in other words, the virus has zoonotic origins. A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan CDC Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for his warnings.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and informed WHO.
A large number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which later sparked an investigation in early January.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, supported by migration during the New Year's Eve and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and rail transit point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Further official data indicate that 6,174 people had symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and create border controls.
The national response included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as a stay-at-home order, a place-of-shelter order, or provincial quarantine) and nighttime. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in some form of provincial quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people were in provincial quarantine in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in provincial quarantine in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in provincial quarantine in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a sort of regional quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates the earliest cases on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; his hospital reported the observation to Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The public announcement was released by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified the same day.
When this notice was issued, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to curb the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine dubbed "the largest quarantine in human history", sanitary cordon or sanitary boundaries were announced on January 23 to stop traveling in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
The Imlek New Year celebration (25 January) was cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.

Same-day travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for Wuhan, two months after the provincial quarantine was imposed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, without any specific details on when this policy would end.
People who want to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.

On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to the meeting of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan are believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13% had reported symptoms.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases are quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The flight schedule was also affected and changed. South Korea introduced what is considered the world's largest and best-organized program to filter viruses in the population, isolate every person infected, and track and quarantine those who came into contact with them.
The filtering method includes the obligation to report symptoms independently by newcomers from abroad through mobile apps, a viral lantatur or drive-thru test with results available the next day, and an increase in testing capacity to more than 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire city.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for impeachment of President Moon over their claims that the government made a mistake in handling the epidemic, or, conversely, praised the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reported having the lowest total one-day cases in four weeks.

A CNN report said that what contributed to the high mortality rate was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone infected with the virus.
Initially, the United Kingdom's response to the virus was one of the most fragile among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any social restrictive measures or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for being less responsive and less intense in responding to public concerns.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an appealing announcement calling for an end to all non-essential travel and social contact and advising people to work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centres, should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.

However, the United States was slow to begin testing until it obscured the actual outbreak rate at the time.
Testing was disrupted by defective testing equipment produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-governmental testing equipment (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for testing until early March (a doctor's order is required afterwards).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.

Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unusable masks, allegedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched an emergency support operation for developing countries.
WHO commends the Chinese government's efforts in managing and curbing the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up to impede prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "providing routine updates to avoid panic ahead of the New Year's holiday".
On January 23, in response to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while the move was "obviously not a WHO recommendation", it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the places where the epidemic is most concentrated" and it called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".On January 30, after confirming human-to-human transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a World Health Organization (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first implemented during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was identified because of the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have qualified health systems.
Responding to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO called on the global community to contribute $675 million to be used to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "do not have systems to detect people infected with the virus if an epidemic spreads".
Further, Tedros made a statement that "the limits of our strength are on the weakest chain's eyes" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".At a press conference on February 11, WHO designated COVID-19 as the disease name for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to give "a response in the form of a complete submission of the powers of the UN system".
The UN then activated the Crisis Management Team to enable the coordination of the entire UN response, which WHO says would allow them to "focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their membership to cope with the impact of the epidemic in the broader social, economic, and developmental fields".
On 14 February, a joint Chinese Mission Team led by WHO was activated; the team aims to provide staff of international and WHO members in China in order to assist domestic management as well as to evaluate "levels of severity and transmission of disease" by holding workshops and meetings with relevant national level bodies and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of countryside and provincial level countermeasures activities, which include urban and rural order". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare itself for the potential coronavirus pandemic" and said that, although it is too early to mention it, countries should still be in the "pandemic ready phase".
In response to the growing epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from "high" to "very high", this being the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned that, "It's time for every government on the planet to face the reality: Wake up.
The virus may be coming to your place and you need to be prepared", and urges that proper mitigation measures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan further stated that the current data does not allow the Public Health Office to declare a global pandemic, and said that such a declaration meant "we basically accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by the level of concern and severity, as well as the level of alarming latency of action". WHO received sharp criticism for its assessment of inadequacy in dealing with the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, which was addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of every individual should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group states that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and the government bears responsibility for this.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as a justification for discriminating against a particular group.
The members underlined that every individual has a right to health, including disabled people, minority groups, the elderly, internal refugees, homeless people, people living in extreme poverty, people in prisons, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are working to address the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a programme to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with views and suggestions.
From policies to strengthen the world's health and economic systems to overcome the impact of regional quarantine and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes National Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate coordinated global responses to the coronavirus challenges.
The Chinese government has received criticism from the United States, the United Kingdom Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for handling the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were suspended in connection with the handling of quarantine measures in Central China, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the political agency response in dealing with the epidemic in the region.
Some commentators believe that the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier claims that the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US Donald Trump administration has referred to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's covert actions are giving strength to a virus that is now turning into a global pandemic". The statement was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racism and "distracting attention from its administration's failure to address the coronavirus".
The Daily Beast gets a U.S. government message that outlines a communication strategy and clearly comes from the National Security Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about China.
We were told to try and convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television".Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geo-political component, which includes the battle to gain influence through fact-finding and 'generous politics.'"
Borrell also said that, "The Taliban aggressively pushed the message that, unlike the US, they were responsible and reliable partners".
China also called for the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, and reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own countries.
There have also been reported masks-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has taken hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian troops to send military medical personnel, special disinfectant vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or little useful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of carrying out a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attack.
Lombardy's President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to his colleagues in the US, [Putin] assumed that if US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials got the chance, they would also be able to respond if needed".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO warfare exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Defender exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only endangers the lives of US troops and many European countries participating, but also the people of the countries where they operate".The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about two dozen parliamentarians infected and fifteen current or former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and saying that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has prompted calls for the United States to adopt common social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts suspect that it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized "Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine capacity" after Japan announced that everyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-designated location.
Initially, South Korean public opinion was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions, both calling for Moon's resignation, based on their claims of government failure in handling the epidemic, and praising its response.
Some commentators expressed concern that it might allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by indefinite decree, suspend parliamentary and general elections, and punish people believed to spread false information about the virus and government crisis management.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed on a lack of supply, which stems from increased use of equipment globally to fight the outbreak, panic buying, and disruption of plant and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Some districts also suffered from panic buying which resulted in shortages of basic necessities, such as food, toiletries, and bottled water, which triggered a shortage of supplies.
Specifically, the tech industry has warned of delays in electronic shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for self-protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times normal prices and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It's also causing a lack of self-protection devices worldwide, and WHO warns that this will be a health hazard.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan province, as well as high demand for food products, the two areas were avoided from food shortages.
Chinese and Italian measures in combating the illegal stockpiling and trade of important products have succeeded so that the acute food shortages expected to occur in Europe and North America can be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large-scale agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representation.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government offices released suggestions for pork to ensure the nutritional adequacy of the community.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which require food producers to keep reservations for such emergencies.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the virus outbreak is thought to cause a major destabilization threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential for the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the epidemic-induced economic downturn on global growth could exceed the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from a team at Washington University in St. Louis states that the outbreak has impacted more than $300 billion on global supply chains, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported "slowdowns" after oil prices fell sharply due to declining demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their sharpest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day decline since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
The three stock indices closed the week with a decline of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central bank and the state.
The central bank reacted faster than it did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severely affected sectors due to travel restrictions, public places including tourist attractions closing, and government actions restricting travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry is at an unprecedented level.
Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Imlek New Year holiday.
A number of crowded events were cancelled by the central and provincial governments, including the annual New Year's Eve festival, and private companies also independently closed shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's Eve events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its infectious disease response to a high level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and canceled New Year's celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50~60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to the shopping center in March compared to February.
Mall operators around the world are imposing additional measures, such as increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and event cancellations. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession caused by the pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase by between 14 and 22 million people compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers were displaced from their homes in rural provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak could cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates could reach 32%. Provincial quarantine in India causes tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada experience some kind of job loss.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes. Almost half a million companies in Germany applied for a government-subsidized short-term employment scheme for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operation of both organisations and individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Organizations of the arts and culture sector seek to uphold their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of employees and the community, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another disadvantage of the recent and very rapidly developing disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian conversion season, was canceled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elderly to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online live broadcasting or television, while others offer drive-in or lantern worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the closure of synagogues, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plans, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but not later than summer 2021". Worldwide, casinos and other venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands delaying or cancelling concert tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also postpone all shows.
Artists explored various ways to continue producing and sharing works via the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live broadcast concerts or creating a web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are circulating online with many people turning to humor and distractions amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited in China) noted racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people were quick to accept the virus or receive what they claimed was a legitimate reward.
Several African countries also experienced an increase in anti-Bangkok sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their district origin.
There's already support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak's development to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan tag became a trend on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased rates of racial harassment and assault.
US President Donald Trump has been criticized for calling the coronavirus "Chinese Virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Tiongkok.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities are reported to be harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The state-run Bharatiya Janata Party president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that is why God is taking revenge on them".
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misguided".In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Tionghoa residents were rampant due to the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid bans have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the epidemic available to open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results quickly on a preprint server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of viruses and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA only.
This test is used to confirm a new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have already been infected, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or those without symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality figures and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from these test results.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on virus prevalence in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a huge variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of reported case fatalities, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breath samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests on throat swabs are reliable only in the first week of disease.
In the future, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from the inner airway using a catheter or material removed through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also expanded testing on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) that is clinically-oriented on 28 January 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that is owned by all coronavirus beta, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection devices.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests on the old version of the test tool yielded unconvincing results due to reagent failure, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that state and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.
The test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveilans in Healthcare.On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly expanded the test to detect COVID-19 infections.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that can be performed in 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing using non-PCR isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
Since it requires no series of temperature-switching cycles, this method can yield positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott anticipates increasing production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test using monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to a new coronavirus nucleocapsid (N-protein) protein is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope of delivering results in 15 to 20 minutes like a fast influenza test.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic imaging has little diagnostic value at an early stage, so CT [computed tomography] imaging may have existed before the onset of symptoms".
Special features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opasities with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the current pandemic onset point showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many overlapping imaging features with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in the diagnosis of COVID-19".
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals as early as 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but availability will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although a series of samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a peripheral blood sample obtained through a skin injection is generally used.
Unlike PCR methods, extraction steps are not required prior to examination. As of March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 agencies that provided the agency with notice as needed and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization.
Its testing capacity is up to several hundred samples in a matter of hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR testing for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection.
Hong Kong devised a scheme to allow suspected patients to stay at home, "the emergency department would give the patient a specimen tube", they spit in it, send it back, and get test results a few seconds later. The NHS UK announced that the NHS was pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they came to the hospital or had to disinfect an ambulance if used.
The laboratory testing center has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and largest testing of any country.On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the road hospital order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
Costs are covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a randomized controlled trial was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown due to only positive results being reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing further if the combined sample is found positive.In Wuhan, a 2,000 square meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Mandarin: 火 眼, or "Eye of Fire" in Indonesian) opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling suggests that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity were not available.
Wuhan Laboratories was immediately followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using just 93 tests. This balanced design can be performed in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid manipulation.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
As a result, a number of researchers have sought to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.
This was achieved through a combination of surface testing and the purchase of a population-scale mass-produced laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various test prescriptions targeting various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of test equipment that was shipped to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28 until it slowed testing available in the U.S. At the start of the outbreak, China and the United States were having problems with the reliability of testing equipment; both countries and Australia could not provide enough testing equipment to meet the demand and recommendations of healthcare professionals testing.
Experts say that the extensive testing availability in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was developed in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests pending work in U.S. private laboratories, and the preparation of waste equipment and chemical reagents becoming scarce.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on its test equipment.
In the United States, the test equipment developed by the CDC had "faults"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barrier preventing private testing.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or to use the test equipment correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would withdraw equipment that yielded incorrect results, and replace it with other test equipment provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from China yielded incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test equipment be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test equipment purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they were not "using it".The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test equipment from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that the test equipment could not be used.
The test, followed by quarantine of people who tested positive and tracking of people in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, the site of Italy's first COVID-19 death, conducted two rounds of testing on a population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of those tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions on these communities, new infections are eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than in other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also addressed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive territorial quarantine, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the death toll, had much lower case fatalities, probably because these countries were more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America, and one in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% test positive result" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only test people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than countries that test all of their population, whether they have symptoms or not, with other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hands to remove dirt, oils, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Consistent handwashing with soap at certain "critical times" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also get respiratory illnesses, such as influenza or measles, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments of the day when soap is essential to washing hands are: before and after urination, after cleaning a child's ass or changing a diaper, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Without soap and water, the hands can be washed with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning up a kid who just used the bathroom.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal dung.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And it also reduces infant mortality in domestic births.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increasing hand washing practices can slightly increase the growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, child mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing moderate behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce mortality from the disease by nearly 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as unconscious behaviors are practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of death in infants; the disease causes the death of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before meals and after using the toilet an embedded habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical measure, as well as reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory tract infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (drinking, urinating), after cleaning the child's ass (replacing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other important times to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent disease transmission are before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was near the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent. Now there are some behavioural change methodologies available to increase adoption of hand washing behaviour at critical times.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of precise scale action to support children's health and education.
The administration of worm remedies twice a year, coupled with daily hand washing with soap and daily flossing with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to solvent and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fat and protein, which are components of organic waste, are not easily soluble in water.
Nevertheless, the cleaning of fat and protein is aided by adequate water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies investigating bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely to occur because the bacteria are soaked in foam.
However, the CDC maintains that "liquid soap that is produced from untouched containers is preferred".
Antibacterial soaps are widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as those marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (crown peppers, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that ordinary soap is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Warm water that's comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the amount of microbes in the hands.
Handwashing or hand antiseptics are water-based hygiene agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents in the form of water-based alcohol wipers (also called alcohol-based hand wipers, antiseptic hand wipers, or hand sanitizers) began to be introduced.
Most of these alcohol- or ethanol-based isopropyl hygiene agents are formulated together with a condensant such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or with a moisturizer such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effects of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide to the solution increases antimicrobial activity further. Handwashing containing at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Rubbing alcohols kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), bacteria that are tuberculosis, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Hand washing containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log 3.5 reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5 reduction) of bacteria in the hand 1 minute after use. Hand washing is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic handwashing is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both hands as well as the edges and ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until liquid, foam, or gel dries.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them on both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand washing, especially when hands look dirty.
The increased use of cleaning agents is due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, cleaning agents should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can often cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effects of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused much less skin irritation and dryness than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcoholic hand wipers are rare.
Lower inclination to cause disturbing contact dermatitis is an attraction of this product compared to handwashing with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic matter, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still present in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, these products performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can't afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, if it comes into contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on recommendations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the Prevention of Disease Control include the following steps:
Wash your hands with running warm or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because the baths in which they are kept may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not appear to be affected.
Wash your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hand, the fingertips, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly with soap than with water alone.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer eliminates more germs.
The bile is carefully underwater flowing.
Washing in the sink can get your hands back contaminated.
Dry with a dry cloth or let it dry in the air.
Wet, damp hands are more likely to be re-contaminated, with the most commonly missed areas being the thumb, wrist, fingertip, and underneath nails.
Artificial nails and stripped nail paint can store microorganisms.
Moisturized lotions are often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap and/or soap water is not available, for example, draining water from a suspended and piped syringe or bottle and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural districts in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-taps", as well as other low-cost options.
Tipy taps are a simple technology that uses water bottles suspended by ropes, a foot-operated lever to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more studies show that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper lap industry, to compare the hygiene levels of paper lap, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the palms.
Drying with jet air dryers caused an average increase in total bacterial counts of 42% in fingerbooks and 15% in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper clip, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in fingerbooks and 77% in the palm. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
Jet air dryers, which blow air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), are capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The paper sheets did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, changes in the number of bacteria were observed:
There are many hand drying manufacturers, and hand drying has been compared to drying using a sheet of paper.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer is an alternative during travel without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand washes must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There's an electronic device that provides feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or a gel to rub and rub each hand.
Hands should be rubbed with fingers tied together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water in the hands, hands must be thoroughly washed and dried with clean cloth.
After drying, the paper clip is used to turn off the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents hand contamination from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("pests") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching the patient and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other moderate procedures can reduce catheter-related blood flow infection rates by up to 66 percent.
WHO's hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has five times to wash your hands:
After being exposed to blood/body fluids
Before aseptic duty, and
After the patient's treatment, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (a "medicine" or "antimicrobial" soap) works to kill hand washing agents.
Such killing functions may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To 'squeeze' the hands before surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching is required, a chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a sterile lap to dry the hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile instruments to clean the bottom of the nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbow, usually 26 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When you rinse, water in your lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into your hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgical robe is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after treating a sick person.
For the management of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefits obtained were very few when the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison between hand-brushing with an alcohol-based solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each shows that alcohol-based handbrushing reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand wipers in reducing the influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care regimes may involve education for staff on hand washing, increased availability of alcohol-based hand wipers, and written as well as oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine the most effective interventions in various health care systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents' homes, schools, and workplaces makes achieving universal handwashing practices a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, hand washing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although there is an option to make cheap hand washing facilities available.
However, low hand-washing rates can also be due to a habit that is already established, not a lack of soap or water.
The incentive and incentive to wash hands with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term population behavior changes.
To operate effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of school handwashing is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take moderate and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, the school can move from one star to ultimately three stars.
Building a handwashing facility could be part of a handwashing campaign to reduce childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to raise awareness that seeks to achieve the goal of behavioral change.
Several studies have investigated the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALY) or the measure of years lost due to illness.
One survey showed that promoting handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing to human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing" in Britain.
At that time, many people still believed that infections were caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne and health-care-related infections made the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against the infectious diseases.
For example, posters of "proper hand-washing techniques" are hung next to hand-washing machines in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands of" something means expressing a person's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to participate in something.
The phrase comes from a Bible passage in the Gospel of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands continually to clear her imaginary stains; an act that showed her guilt for the crimes she had committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after recalling or contemplating unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after the washing had less opportunity to engage in "cleaning" compensation actions, such as volunteering.
The religion commands hand washing for purity and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a part of hand washing rituals in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netila yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodology to hazard management for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper hazard management in the workplace depends on the workplace and workplace tasks, which are based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the individual risk factors of workers who may be susceptible to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers; for this job, policy infection prevention measures are being proposed, which include hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Current exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to an ongoing community outbreak or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population densities, and high volume retail orders.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to policy infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protection against sneezing, and provision of self-protection devices when encountering COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers healthcare and morgue exposures to people known or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if the employee performs aerosol manufacturing procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from, people known or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19.
Hazard control appropriate to these workers includes technical controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and self-protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact in the workplace.
Employees may not come to work because they are sick, need to care for others, or are afraid of exposure.
The pattern of trade can vary, both in terms of the type of goods requested and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping outside rush hour, through delivery, or by appointment).
Finally, shipments from geographically vulnerable regions of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Precautions and infectious disease control plans can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plan considers the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and occupational tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community order, as well as individual risk factors of employees, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the management needed to address the risks and an emergency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and plans for the control of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of plague control include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the business community is influencing the response taken.
Hazard management hierarchy is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group hazard management based on its effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly self-protection devices.
Technical control involves isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that requires action by an employee or employer.
Self-protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of APDs should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as they occur (e.g., respirators), consistently and correctly applied, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and properly stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contact with the public and other coworkers.
The recommended policy infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if ill, breathing ethics include covering coughs and sneezing, providing nets and trash cans, preparing work remotely or on shift with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, informing employees not to use other people's tools and equipment, and performing regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever reducing medication or other symptom-modifying medication, and that sick leave policies be flexible so that employees can stay at home to care for sick family members, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, current exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require close contact or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are unknown or suspected to be suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to contagion in the community around the business location, or because someone is newly travelling internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These groups include workers with contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population densities, and high volume retail orders. Technical controls for these and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as plastic cleaners of the sneezers, and installing drive-through or lining windows for customer service. Administrative controls for these and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, making work shifts with gradual arrival/return times, stopping nonessential travel to locations experiencing COVID-19, developing a forum communication plan to respond to worker concerns, equipping and training for current worker risk factors and protective behavior, training workers to use face-to-face clothing and protective equipment, providing personal protective equipment and tools to support the use of hands and hands with virtual communication, and at least restricting access to COVID-19 workplaces, and possibly including the use of hand-to-hand protection tools and protective clothing, and other measures that may require the use of hand-to-hand protection devices and hand protective equipment, restricting the use of COVID-19 safety glasses, at least, and restricting the use of COVID-19 for workers, and restricting the use of COVID-19 safety measures.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If someone falls ill on an airplane, proper controls to protect employees and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a cabin crew to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking them to cover their mouths and noses with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
You must wear medical gloves once in the cabin when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly other protective equipment if sick passengers experience fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in life-threatening bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard management includes delaying travel if ill, self-isolation, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in the cabin of the person who is isolated. Despite the spread in the community, for schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if the person who is infected has ever been in the school building.
If there is a spread in the community at a minimal to moderate level, social restrictions strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high prevalence in the local community, in addition to social restrictive strategies, extending school closures may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who should be in contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 person are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection devices.
If close contact occurs during capture, workers should clean and disinfect their belts and duty equipment before re-use using a household cleaner spray or lap and follow standard operating procedures to handle and dispose of container APDs as well as to handle and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care facilities and mortuaries to be in the high-risk or very high-risk category.
High-risk jobs include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transportation personnel who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work is at a very high risk of exposure if the employee performs aerosol manufacturing procedures on, or collects or handles specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol manufacturing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
High-risk mortuary work includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes extremely high-risk exposure if the worker performs an autopsy. Additional technical handling for these risk groups includes isolation rooms for patients known or suspected of COVID-19, including when aerosol manufacturing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and mortuaries.
Specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who arrive be separated into different waiting rooms based on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients known or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people undergoing aerosol manufacturing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better N95 filter face covering respirators should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes fitness testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend full-covered or coverall clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people who take breathing specimens, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol manufacturing procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the supply of APDs is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APDs through remote medical services, physical limitations such as a transparent window of view, with only those involved in direct treatment being allowed to enter rooms containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APDs needed for a specific task, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

[Covid-19] Easing the burden and preparing for the future
The following is the list of official languages of the Republic of Moldova.
License: CC0: No rights are protected
We've found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear the global human connection and the responsibility we have for each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all our coworkers through email, phone calls, and chat is an incredible validation of the extraordinary human presence, which we're lucky enough to work with.
My gratitude and my pride are infinite to call you all my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world today to have access to Wikipedia and how powerful it is to keep this vital resource online for everyone.
Your job is to make this happen, whether you keep this site running, help pay our colleagues, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, especially right now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C-Teams met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization during this time.
We're desperate to relieve the pressure and support our mission in the long run.
If you have to cut down on your work schedule, that's fine.
To all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work expectations are about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a holiday, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, pay for medical expenses, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It's not supposed to be said, but we did.
No sick leave or PTO is necessary, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure key work areas can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive with COVID-19, please inform Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management).
The guys who are paid hourly pay will be paid full.
We have said it, and we say it again, to honor our commitment to our contractor colleagues and hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we're with you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress into the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
A certain job is considered essential.
There's some work to be done.
SRE, HR, Trust & Security Operations, as well as the Fundraising team, among others, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start a process with all departments to assess our current goals and shift our focus to supporting what's essential to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will do nothing for the future.
We don't plan on "overtime after work" after the pandemic passes.
You won't be expected to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines at the moment.
We realize that the situation is changing and will be able to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to the new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget so employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care for loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work on fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and current planning stresses across the organization.
We'll submit our proposal to the House next week and update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, exposure, and cleaning of offices
Last week, we were informed that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus fluid to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floors.
The building's own security verification protocols are implemented by using products that support the security of its tenants.
We're glad that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full-range work order, in line with guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in NYC know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote colleagues realize that this may need adjustment and they want to give you some advice:
The duration of the meeting is at most one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into a few days.
Set a clear meeting schedule, and send in the reading material.
Make videos by default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and to record a list of speakers, and someone to help make meeting notes (or do collaborative record-making).
Email technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small meals.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about shared jobs
The HR Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidance to support increased work distribution across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel public Wikimedia-funded events, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic over.
We informed them that we understood our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those targets.
Next week we will follow up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, sentiment from across the global community seems to be saddened by this disruption, but at the same time relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is able to set up pages on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect.
We're in this together and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19-related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep updating this page and making sure all the information is in one place.
We are also able to maintain routine communication with staff living in the countries currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or concerns about coverage, or any other matter that may require assistance, feel free to let CRT know and cooperate.
We're here to help provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Global Director of International Human Resources Operations.
Let none of these changes be seen as a disregard for our work and our duties.
Rather, this change is a recognition that, right now, our jobs and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways we've never done before.
These changes are steps we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we planned in advance will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and maybe months.
We need you all to make it happen, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work as best you can when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!

b'The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has the M2 terminal-N peptidase domain and the terminal-C renal amino acid collectrin transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-membrane inhibitor protein, with an enzymatically active domain exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracel domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II lung alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II by vasoconscription.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradicin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point into cells for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of S1 proteins to spike or thresholds of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endosytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosomes located within the cell.
The virus's entry process also requires priming of S protein by the TMPRSS2 host protease serine, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend extending standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapies.
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia in patients who are at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less potent compared to the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipoplysaccharide-induced acute respiratory syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a duration of 30 minutes plus the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with increased blood circulation of angiotensin II. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
b'The COVID-19 Application is a mobile software application designed to assist contact tracking to combat the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have had contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been developed or proposed, which have received official government support in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for developing contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are in question, especially with regard to systems based on the geographic location tracking of app users.
A less privacy-intensive alternative includes using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based apps directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have come into contact with COVID-19 patients.
It's used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, it's called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracking app was in the advanced stages of development and would be available for distribution in a few weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are considering an application based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow; the app is designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur with application-based systems, which include false positives and the possibility of ineffectiveness if the data taken by applications is limited to a small fraction of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, namely restricting only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon are implementing similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be discontinued once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization sets out eight requirements for government projects:
the surveilans must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the extension of monitoring and surveillance shall have a sunset clause;
data use should be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity shall be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid any further exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
there should be protection against abuse and citizens' right to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant stakeholders" are required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing tracking mechanisms from the device's operating system once they are no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than app, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of privacy-protecting systems have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to conduct contact tracking.
Instead of using dedicated applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made the location information publicly available, which was allowed by the extensive changes in information privacy laws following the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using a centralized system as well as a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol.
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protecting techniques while collecting and using location or trail intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally also founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and staff without compromising the privacy of those data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have a fundamentally similar approach and are highly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect to achieving wide adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official application open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that operate the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launching tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
This feature is integrated directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problem of continuous data acquisition and surveillance by first distributing the system through operating system updates, then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'A drug repositioning (also called a new purpose assignment, new profile, or new assignment to a drug or therapeutic transition) is the use of a drug that has been approved for a new treatment purpose, namely for a disease or medical condition that is different from the initial purpose of drug development.
The pathway is a scientific research line currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein having several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of such ligand binding sites could be the basis for a project to develop an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent polymerase, helikase, S protein, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A, et al investigated several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their molecular similarities to approved and highest-compliance drugs in order to accelerate the development of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chlorokuin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorokuin and related hydrochlorokuin were two of four drugs to be studied as part of the clinical trial of Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that testing of chlorokuin and hydrochlorokuin in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorokuin phosphate based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been determined.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorokuin in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy trial of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of four days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the total patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmacy Service reminds the public that the evidence to support the drug is not high and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would purchase the drug from Japan for preparation and use by the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration to buy the drug, which may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a virus that has already multiplied.
This medication may not be safe for use by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the lopinavir and ritonavir antiviruses, concluded that there were no observed benefits.
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There has been criticism in the scientific community about the allocation of resources to position drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.
One of the problems with antivirus treatment is that resistance is created through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early trial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials underway, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely ill COVID-19 patients, namely two controlled placebo (Tiongkok, Canada) and one uncontrolled placebo (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a new premenstrual coronavirus infection.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from hospitalized severe cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, dubbed COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraception are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients so much so that it prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-center study in 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has been focused on targeting new treatments on approved and developed antiviral drugs for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guideline
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics identified as potentially newly-targeted drugs for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease's causative virus, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I peace studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, resulting in huge investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
CEPI's initiative issued a statement in April that the things to consider in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment on the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI's chief executive reported that 10 different technology platforms are under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Key platform targets for the Phase I security study include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developers of Phase I and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus (developer of Phase I vector and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (assumed to be in planning or under planning).
Phase I-II trials conduct preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, placebo-controlled, and at several sites, while determining a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the control group, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates that are actively being developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "praklinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they were starting to develop a vaccine, with a target of human trials by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, headed by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing the vaccine.
Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen laboratories in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with technology similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex subsidiary NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they were launching a vaccine project to develop an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "in 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were partnering with Novavax Inc.
in vaccine development and manufacturing.
Furthermore, the partnership announced plans for preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, vaccine development would take at least about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory study, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered "a 'large sum of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the candidate mRNA-based vaccine, BNT162, is in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would get the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and vaccine candidates in the final stages could begin testing on humans in the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Coalition for Epidemic Prevention Innovation (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health office announced that scientists had started testing six vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving sequences from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 medical COVID-19 control research projects, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million in funding specifically for developing COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, on mice; they noted that "MNAs administering the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine induce a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that begins to be seen 2 weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using a bacteriophage, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
As of March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities have gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further randomized trials in Australia followed 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that a vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggested the need for containment measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
As MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have encouraged conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been made available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus mainly spreads between humans through close contact, often through splashes or small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although produced when breathing, the droplet usually falls to the ground or to the surface and does not spread to distances.
A person can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms appear and after subsequent stages of disease.
Masks are recommended for suspected infections and those who treat them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and some require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may have no symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or constipation in the chest that persists, confusion, difficulty waking up, and a blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, itching, or sore throats, may be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only clinically described as chest cramps and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This is called incubation.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportion of people infected who show no symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain symptomless while hospitalized.
The National Health Commission of China began to include symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral loads on a large scale.
Speaking out loud releases more splashes or drops than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause a droplet to be pushed up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in the hallway outside people's rooms produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can turn the respiratory secretion into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there is concern that the virus may spread through the faeces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that viruses can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products break down the viral protective fat layer, deactivate the virus, as well as freeing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectants), were less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in a median of two days after the inpatient treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the new features of SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in naturally related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lung is the organ most affected by COVID-19 as the virus accesses the host cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bump" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries are found in 12% of infected people treated in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illnesses.
High rates of cardiovascular symptoms are due to the presence of a systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High incidences of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the respiratory tract epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been shown to correlate with monosite recruitment that secretes inflammatory IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on breath samples obtained through nasopharyngeal exhaustion; however, nasal exhaustion or sputum samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but require two blood samples taken two weeks apart so that the result has a small time value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing independently to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected previously) is under development, but has not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with the test shows that it is only 60 to 70 percent accurate.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infection based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass gaps with peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distributions are commonly found in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (the thickening of the lobular septum with varying alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings in autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of multi-core giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends closing the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large-scale public gatherings.
Restrictive guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
There is no known effective cure yet to prevent COVID-19.As vaccines are not expected to be available until early 2021, a key part in addressing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "curve-leveling".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, and after piercing their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore, the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self-hygiene and lifestyle as well as healthy diets are recommended to boost immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for dealing with hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Intensive care and pulmonary care professionals in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical authorities recommend more paracetamol (acetaminophen) than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care settings when performing aerosol-producing procedures, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals treating COVID-19 patients, the CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR in addition to using standard prevention, contact prevention, and airborne prevention measures.
Recommended equipment are: APD cloaks, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized these masks for use based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face masks or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or alternative ventilation, but some cases are severe.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people inpatient, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high nasal flow cancers or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two methods yielded the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to maintain invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal canula.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle the sudden surge in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized end up in ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
A ventilator capable of performing high pressure control mode and PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pneumothoracic and lung injury associated with the ventilator.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on the treatment potential began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in further testing.
Antivirus can be tried on people with severe illnesses.
WHO-recommended volunteers participated in potential drug safety and efficacy trials. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is very or immediately at risk.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to address the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contacts' using surveillance data so it can detect potential infection risk.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also informs local health officials. Data analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the cell phone data of suspected coronavirus infections.
The measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may have come into contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed a telephone location data aggregate to the German federal government body, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is using facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said it was told mobile phone operators that "40% of citizens are still moving around".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline is a perfect storm that is endangering the mental health and well-being of the community".
The disease can last mildly with little or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 remains scarce. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs to cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or complex organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 symptoms showed an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in the infirmary.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study that looked at early cases, the median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of a postmortem lung sample showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromycosidic exudate in both lungs.
Cytopathic changes in the virus are observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized have congenital conditions.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of light counting could cause deaths to be counted too high.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases that have occurred in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is calculated to be too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also lead to post-treatment-intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Immunity may be gained, if we look at other coronavirus behaviours, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by positive coronavirus testing a few days later.
This case is believed to be a worsening residual infection, not a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and derived from animals, through a spreading infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infections was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptom onset date was 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported the earliest manifestations of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, as well as being influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the healthcare system, the handling options, the time since the first outbreak, and the characteristics of populations such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO established the ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate to cases was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measurements include case fatality figures (CFR), which reflect the percentage of people diagnosed to die from a particular disease, and infection fatality figures (IFR), which reflect the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a particular disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and it is likely that not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German healthcare system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and new women not apparent at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact reasons for this gender-based difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers, especially nurses, is higher, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the moment the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigma.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as temporary names for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines which advised not to use location names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print healthcare materials such as nasal vapour and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on the required time scale, a local company reengineered and printed 100 valves needed overnight.
After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, the researchers aim to create a virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either dormant or dead virus, is intended to quickly trigger the human body's immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines made using these strategies should be tested to determine their safety and humanity. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method remains controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chlorokuin.
Newly-targeted antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries with a reporting deadline of late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates is already in place. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence for remdesivir's effectiveness.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that double doses are extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chlorokuin on the policy of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research suggests that early priming of the proton-switching protein by serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is critical for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chlorokuin and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm complications can occur in advanced severity COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antitoxin properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing a nationally-proven phase 2 trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illnesses.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are suspected to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfers of purified and glued antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them are being studied as a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the expected working mechanism for passive antibody therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid portion of the recovered patient's blood and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronary heart disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
