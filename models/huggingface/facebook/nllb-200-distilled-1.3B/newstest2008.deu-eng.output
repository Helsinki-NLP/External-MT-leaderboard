Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, inflation was higher than expected in November, with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent recorded after 2.6 per cent in October, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rates, which it believes will encourage a spiral of inflation as commodity prices rise and unemployment falls slightly.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is at a crossroads: It must "de-inflate" inflation to avoid the need for action later.
In November, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year high of 3.3 percent; in Spain, it climbed from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The rise in food and energy prices is responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
MATIF wheat prices rose 88 percent and soybean prices also reached a record high since 1973.
The price of cooking oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil has risen 52 percent this year - last month the price of a barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1% to 2.5% in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9% in 2009.
For the next three to four months, analysts expect inflation to be 3 percent, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz's support has grown significantly by early December, with the party having the largest base camp for the first time since 2002, while support for the Socialists has reached an all-time low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference is clear among party-leading voters, thanks to the high resolve of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71%) are in favour of the MSZP, compared with a fifth (20%).
The survey shows that MDF and SZDSZ are below the entry barrier: they make up two per cent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared with the last low, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who rate the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "fairly bad".
After a more optimistic outlook in the spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
The majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further in the coming year; only one tenth expect an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - rated the Prime Minister's work as "rather bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or general confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the proportion of supporters of Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% who distrust the Fidesz party leader.
One indicator of political sentiment is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be controlled without a change of government.
The report also stresses that the EU must be able to take action to combat unemployment and to combat unemployment.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would "certainly" participate, and another 20 percent said they would "probably" vote.
By comparison, if the general elections were held on Sunday, only 55% would "certainly" go to the polls, while another 15% would say they would "probably" participate.
74% would vote against tuition, 79% against practice fees, and 84% against hospital fees.
The proportion of those who oppose the study, practice and hospital fees is 81, 84 and 89 percent, respectively, when divided by the group of those who "certainly" voted.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco is up almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budauer trade area have again maintained their average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs shopping triangle, the price of the usual "Napi" Christmas basket has risen by 16 percent this year, but all hypermarkets have recorded price increases of over HUF 1,000.
After the food market price surge last December, the percentage of inflation has not been drastic compared with the already high initial level.
However, it is certainly a deterrent for consumers that what they paid well under HUF 9,000 for last year is not available for even HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the 'Napi' basket exceeded the magic limit of HUF 10,000 by at least HUF 91 in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for unicorn and live fish remained almost at the same level as last year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nut and poppy rose sharply.
The prices for flour and bread were in line with the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office, but Auchan had 1 kg of breadsticks for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop to below 200 forints for the product.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 forints, so the drink, including the deposit, cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year's "Napi" shopping cart comparison showed Auchan as the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations show that Cora's price in the Napi shopping cart has increased by 15 percent over last year's Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase was still 1.206.00 forints last year, but the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices last Christmas.
This was precisely the process which hit trade hard: it seemed that the department stores could not decide properly which price range to apply to each item, since the effect of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unpredictable.
(If the trader does not plan the speed of a product, he may lose substantial profits in the price range which depends on traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" basket was so drastically increased last year due to VAT that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even the cheapest one had a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, the price of everyday consumer goods in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office recorded an increase in price of more than 30% over a period of 12 months.
This is the case with eggs, as well as flour.)
However, if one looks at the "Napi" cart, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, since the price level of the already expensive product has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the oil suppliers - after all, they were able to pass on the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are being reported all the time.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices at all.
Large quantities of everything are bought, durable food is on pallets and on the stores.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless lines at the cash registers in all three department stores when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country is reporting a lower customer base, so many multinationals complain to pollsters that they cannot even achieve their planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are being saved
This year, more than a thousand infections were recorded in hospitals as a result of improper use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overcrowding, overwork of staff - all factors that are not conducive to controlling infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, the cost of disinfectants is also reduced.
The trauma unit at János Hospital recently diagnosed an MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
There was a similar infection earlier this year.
The man who was injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but soon afterward the man had to return with an MRSA infection.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System from hospitals, according to Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer of the National Epidemiology Center.
So, this is the number of infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens that have been reported in hospitals, but the dark number is probably higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are carried in the nose by about one third of people without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as strep throat, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if the drugs are given at too high a dose or used improperly, the well-responsive bacteria will become antibiotic-resistant and spread rapidly in hospitals under the right conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently malfunctioning immune systems, but also in the elderly or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA is not a special infection, such incidents are part of the daily routine of the hospital.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is not found only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks when they are treated, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment", says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are screened for MRSA when they are admitted to hospital, infection cannot always be prevented.
Sampling too infrequent
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals are preventable, but current conditions and circumstances are not conducive to curbing the emergence or spread of the MDR-CoV, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is mainly found in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen patients admitted and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not as common in Hungarian hospitals.
The reason for this is that the state health insurance system does not provide any funding for this study.
Most cases are not discovered until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, says the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies are intended to be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always followed by hospitals.
Among outpatients or those in primary care, microbiological sampling is even less common, says Karolina Böröcz.
The savings are in the disinfectant
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is why handwashing, or wearing gloves and masks, is so important, but there are also serious shortcomings in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but local hospitals may not always be able to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often crowded, with beds close together, although epidemiologically speaking, they should be separated by at least five feet.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz notes, even in hospitals with less financial resources, there are savings on disinfectants, fewer nurses, many patients - all factors that contribute to the development of infections.
Such infections have been shown to be far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped if these protective measures are followed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections are a huge expense to health insurance companies, so they're being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention or control of MRSA was included in the government programme.
Initial evidence shows that the programme is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of the emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
The death squad chief wasn't drunk.
The official report on the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the 22nd district is now available.
The now-resigned police chief of the 22nd district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the spokesman for the Budapest prosecutor's office, said on Friday after the official report on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, which showed that the police chief had not consumed alcohol before taking the wheel.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Road in the 22nd district and hit a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(However, according to StVO, this is not a mitigating factor - the driver has priority, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
Police reports say the driver suffered a shock, then resigned and requested retirement.
The Budapest prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had been cooperating with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total of EUR 400 million, to be used for education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects in 2006 with grants from the Cohesion Fund. e EUR 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier, with the current agreement dealing with the use of the EUR 200 million provided.
The EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be used for budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contractors signed an agreement for EUR 50 million, which will be mainly used for research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also covered the subject of subway line 4.
It was agreed that once Hungary had clarified the details of the subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this could be achieved in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate is based on the Euribor rate and the loan is provided by the EIB with an eight-year grace period, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe is watching the Balkan country, which was rarely mentioned before.
What, where and who is buying on the EU's still cheapest market, but one that is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most desirable place to buy property in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renner, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's interior will attract investors sooner or later, for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the particularly advantageous area of Russe will also see more buyers.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive offers - commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golfing paradises, attracting tourists in the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy property in Bulgaria also want to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and increasingly from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are highlighted, but proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category is those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations for Germans in December).
The third group is businessmen who invest with the aim of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
The cost of housing in the capital is increasing, driven by ever-increasing demand.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the EU, it has seen an annual increase of 21% over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent
As announced by Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which sets out measures to reduce emissions after 2012, the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
The Commission is also proposing a new programme for the development of the European Union.
The US has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but that it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to help the developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on assistance to developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, which is expected to be part of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be seen in the 'Piac et Profit' report.
Hungary six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (from 1990 levels) whether or not the 'post-2012 agreement' is achieved, and that the Union would be ready to commit to a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries and developing countries were also willing to meet their obligations responsibly and to the best of their ability.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its then 15 Member States, had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 1985-87 - a target which the country will certainly meet, as the press release from the Ministry of the Environment states.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012, in which case the Kyoto Protocol's reduction agenda would not be followed by a new international emissions reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific committee on climate change of the UN, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, in its recent report.
This would delay emissions reduction and would inevitably cause the earth's average temperature to rise by more than 2°C, with the consequences, scientists say, to be extremely serious and irreparable.
British Army is advertising on YouTube
British Army units have posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage, taken with miniature cameras attached to helmets, is monitored at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where it is posted online.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have contributed 139 such recordings, and their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The UK Ministry of Defence was registered under defence headquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force (IPTF) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the goal of recruiting soldiers, and the Defense Department says the posts also serve the purpose of informing the public about the true goals of foreign missions.
This kind of propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television ads, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but the videos always carry a degree of political message, as they in their own way justify the existence of government-mandated military action.
Americans advertise with games
The army also has to fight against amateur film that, along with the carefully edited, censored footage, also gets on the net - such as those showing the deaths of soldiers: The somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films only talk about the losses, but do not show the bloody sides of the war.
The video-sharing platform has already uploaded numerous videos of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre".
The Americans, however, are advertising in a slightly different way, with the free-to-download shooter game "America's Army", in which the player can step into the soldier's skin in a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas celebration with raffles and pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not a bit of a wimp: instead of a Christmas party, she is hosting a work conference where her staff can end the year 2007 with coffee and chat.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others create a Christmas spirit with raffles or shots in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how the Power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already spread to the offices.
The biggest Christmas party of any ministry will be held this year at the Ministry of Defence, but the Ministry's staff are not expected to attend.
The "Orphans' Christmas Party" features gifts for children of fallen soldiers, the "Mission Party" features family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a press reception.
The department is providing about $25 million for the festivities.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are doing a lot more than other departments.
The Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy, which cost HUF 4.32 million, will be held in the House of the Future, and about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
While the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Development Agency (NDA) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the State Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The saalmeet was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a NRA department is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
The building of the Amusement Theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the relevant authorities.
What's with the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to NFY guests but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there on 7 December instead of a Christmas celebration.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
About 500 people came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, and after dinner there was live music to dance to.
At the request of [origo], it was announced that there was no dress or suit requirement at the ball.
The ministries of health, labor, and local government are each preparing for a puritanical celebration.
The Ministry of Health is hosting the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
The Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is officially inviting her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the annual conference.
The press office says that the party will cost 350,000 forints, with about 180 guests being treated to coffee and chat.
Minister for Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the Ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, which is expected to attract 436 employees.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forints per person - around this amount there is a buffet reception followed by a toast.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the staff of the PM have celebrated in this way every year.
But there will be no proper party atmosphere - not only because of the minister's official speech but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture is inviting you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, but the Ministry's Christmas party is cancelled this time.
The hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Palace in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information provided by the department, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
The press office reports that it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions held each year traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and end with a low-key banter.
As the relevant press agencies have reported on request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which will be held at the Museum of Arts and Crafts.
More and more forces are mobilized for a giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordination committee for the indefinite strike on Friday.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, and on Monday, the day of the referendum on the health insurance law, the work stoppage will begin.
The strike is expected to cause significant disruption to traffic as railway services are almost completely suspended and Budapest's public transport operators (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday's strike will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee is also set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will cease work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike, which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law, was not defined.
If the National Council does not approve the Health Insurance Act, the unions will withdraw the call for strike immediately.
If the law is passed, however, the strike committees meet to discuss the next steps.
The National Council's agenda for Monday means that it is even possible that the vote on the health insurance law will not take place until late in the evening or even before midnight.
The strikes, which will begin on Monday, will cause considerable disruption to traffic: railways will stop working indefinitely, most public transport will be stopped in the morning and more than half of Volán's communities will be closed.
At the same time, there will be one-way traffic jams in many places.
The call for the strike was followed by numerous trade unions and civil society organizations - the list of participants is updated on the League website.
Some organisations announced indefinite strikes, others planned temporary work stoppages.
As of Thursday afternoon, no agreement had yet been reached on sufficient services between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the VDSZSZ, the Free Trade Union of Railways, despite the fact that more people are travelling by train, especially around the Christmas holidays.
According to reports so far, the BKVs are on strike from the start of operation until 1 p.m., the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA electricity and heat unions are suspending work for four hours, and the teachers' union, e.g. the Democratic Teachers' Union, have called for two and two- and eight-hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is striking nationwide at different times, alternating between them, and the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and present a new approach to social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, due to be introduced next year.
The third requirement is that eligible occupations should be given access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which is part of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport for the secondary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, which was established in August with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, inter alia: "In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
This is reportedly seen as a failure on the part of the political authorities: "Public figures have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremism and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least because of the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "have seriously damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We recall that since autumn 2006 the reorganisation of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several organizations calling themselves "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"What these groups have in common is that they each define themselves as a civilian organization while openly boasting of preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (disaster response, national defense, law enforcement), citing the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself", it said.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to do so.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association is therefore not only intended to avoid legal obstacles that may arise in the course of registration before the courts - it is also a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as a confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All this has implications for the political stability of the region", it said.
The research institute considers that the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and that the political risk for the entire region has therefore increased.
The Hungarian Guard's activities are reportedly similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The Bulgarian Guard was formed in response to the mass massacres of Roma in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU immediately used the events as a reason to create the National Guard, arguing that the organization's goal was "national protection".
In their view, a real "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent.
The initiative would have sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As mentioned, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced the creation of their own guards for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organising their own protection, says the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the news agency's request: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and if changes in risk are apparent, public opinion would be informed, as in the case of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of rearranging working days around holidays has now become established, but we will have fewer such days next year.
In the EU and America, too, "holiday" has a different meaning.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and days off from work.
The majority of days off are church holidays or related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year's Day: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are days off - the latter just so that the New Year's celebrants can rest.
We have a total of fourteen public holidays throughout the year.
The national holidays are 15 March, which commemorates the 1848 revolution, and 23 October, the anniversary of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st, we celebrate labor, on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two public holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, state or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shifting" has proved successful in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work or go to school on the Saturdays before.
The date on which this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finally worked has been fixed for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public servants and civil servants.
The only exceptions are firms and establishments where the work continues without interruption, including on public holidays.
The only thing that is causing a bit of confusion this year is the end-of-year holidays: from 24 December onwards, life in this country is virtually at a standstill, as most people take time off or a special holiday between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Next year, more holidays will fall in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
The calendar is first "put on its head" around the working day so that people can stay home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 26th, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd, can be a day of rest.
The second change is linked to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, you will have to work in advance on Friday 24 October.
The end of the year will be marked by holidays, however, as everything will be in place from 24 December onwards, even if New Year falls on a Wednesday.
Six little things to scare off your coworkers
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never get -- harmless lies we don't even notice anymore: they bring color into our everyday workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or whether you better face the challenge and try to deliberately avoid these misunderstandings for other annoying situations.
I'll give you a tip.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called", says a colleague.
That it's gonna make you miss a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it, perhaps by calling the marketing department and saying that you regret forgetting to direct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, an apology is the way to go.
Before getting involved in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can do to make your colleagues feel really uncomfortable and try to deliberately avoid these situations.
Borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the notebook was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the pen, thought lost, discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow from your colleagues, for they are rightly upset when they realize that something has been missing.
So don't put envelopes or post-it notes in your pocket from the office, because it could hit you: no more if you need them badly.
You're talking about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what to who?
Where and why?
If possible, information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues should not be handed to everyone!
And when someone does open up and tell us his innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is better to be silent than to speak to those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
You called in sick for no reason?
If you call the office to report sick because you are feeling unwell or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your work, unfinished business, projects with deadlines, now have to be done by your colleagues instead of you.
So don't play badly with your colleagues.
If you know the day before that you will not be able to make it to the office the next day, or that something might happen that will make you stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither your colleagues nor your boss are unexpectedly faced with the absence.
♪ Humming, peeping, making a phone call ♪
You're busy at work, but suddenly you're interrupted by the loud giggles of your colleagues?
Unintentionally overhearing a phone call you shouldn't have?
Do not annoy your colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (that are carried over their heads), trampling, constant scolding or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not really into a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other guy's fault?
If a project is not completed on time, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important message, you should not blame others for your own forgetfulness!
If possible, avoid the office chaos or the loudness of your colleagues.
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others have been affected by them!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for what has been missed is all too appropriate!
The office - a homey experience?
Pants and slacks, comfortable at home, but not lost in the office!
Even if the workplace allowed it, you should not dress so lightly!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself enough to dress appropriately in the office - if desired, even pretty and elegant!
Trying to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic.
A strange melody comes from the radio: the sound of a violin coupled with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, the bass joins the previous sounds, and a female choir becomes a real jewel.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that plays on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't exactly spoiled us with quality electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the traffic differently when you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene are slowly changing the overall picture, and even as garage rock with its guitar quits is back in, local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a pub can't take two pipes - started to make his own way.
He made his breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, but only when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
The first is the "Season" by Ferenc Török).
The band, which had initially performed in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as the almost only trendsetter also marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one cared if they liked wearing that brand.
The band responded as they should have, with a new, even better album.
The new album, entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open up new paths for them, but the title itself expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term dates back to the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but the ethereal character of the music is complemented by the louder guitar, which is in keeping with the spirit of the times and trends, and the influences of rock 'n' roll.
These are the songs that the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself to at the premiere in the Millennium.
One song from the album even became a radio hit - mr2 Petőfi, who has been broadcasting pop music from early morning to late at night, has been making listeners' ears tingle with the song "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So , you 're all right ?
The Hv.G.H. has asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How much of your music is reserved for a certain class?
Balázs Zságer: The term shift music doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two kinds of pop music, and they're not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but it can also be produced only for sale, which makes it commercial music.
Even a good pop song can be born of an honest motive.
The listener's receptivity also works according to this principle, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B.Z.: In foreign countries, especially in the West, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers and tweens go to concerts, but older audiences too.
They're much more attentive to the trends in pop music that are happening around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people hear your music?
B.Z.: Of course, it's a good feeling to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never wrote for the market.
We don't make music for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is most often felt at concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
But I've noticed that if you try to please everyone, you're not interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B.Z.: We don't really go his way, let alone try and interpret it into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players, relying on each other's musical presence and letting it unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons with Yonderboi's work were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the mr2 Petőfi charts, "Wings of Love" is number one.
Many of you have heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged in a slightly more popular style, aimed at a wider audience?
We had no plans to write a hit song that would be used as a pull horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the end of the album, to break up the sound orgy and the more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why her, what was the guiding principle?
B.Z.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came up to put together a choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came into being, which we later dubbed "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help design it?
B.Z.: The song had been in the instrumental version for a while, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this song still needed something.
The chord sequence was so demanding, it required a vocal.
I learned the tune that night, and the girls learned it later.
It all came on the spur of the moment, and frighteningly spontaneously.
I remember being pretty electrified back then, but it was the Divas.
With my voice alone, the song would never have been this powerful.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and at the concert, it seemed that the girls were in the background.
There's no solo part (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing perfectly together and they're not louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They were in the back of the stage, too.
Is it on purpose?
BZ: The fact that they were standing behind was purely due to technical problems.
But we didn't want to give them solo roles.
The song is also about forgetting your ego a little bit, forgetting who you came from and where you're going, just letting those particular wings, the wings of love, lift you up.
I want others to feel the same euphoria we felt when the song was written.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
For example, in the case of musical composition, there was no such thing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play a concert piano, or in "Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't work for a long time, but gradually it all came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
B.Z.: That changes with the concerts and even now that I've released the album.
Right now, it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
A bottomless fraud
This is how Jerome Kerviel, the former employee of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka, calls him.
It was almost five billion euros.
It seems rather that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same as his colleagues, and certainly not incapable.
Unlike all the big banks, he was early to see the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's rather mentally weak", was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as Kerviel's statements in the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, show, he was a man who had made a profit of 1.6 billion euros in business at the end of last year.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to make half a billion euros just from the American crisis.
He saw the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previously had problems paying off, were in trouble.
The impact on the whole economy should not be affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe that and he was right.
By the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it", admits Kerviel, adding that he definitely kept nothing to himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he forged documents to avoid being caught.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk-based
Was he afraid of being caught?
I don't think he did.
"I thought it would satisfy the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank".
Where did he get the nerve to risk so much?
He had to work his way up gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant real estate agent, and in 2005 he became a freelance real estate agent with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Ever since my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development", Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry, the first big success came.
He made a lot of money off the Alliance stock by betting half a billion euros on the London bombings to lose the stock.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you're making a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball", he told the policeman.
But the bosses were supposed to know everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes".
But then, early this year, the big blow came.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
One weekend in mid-January, he tried to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He was on vacation.
"I only took four days off from last year.
A realtor who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked at", Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programmes which will provide the Czech Republic with 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) over the next few years.
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns will come from seven regional development programmes.
The Czech enterprises will be able to receive about 100 billion CZK from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will go to transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and accounts for up to 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money will correspond to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90,8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and firms raise funds for innovative enterprises.
The aim is to attract finance for companies to introduce new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful newcomers in acquiring EU funds to date.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20 years in prison for former president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 million.
Later, however, he was released from prison and was placed under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
It is unclear whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American country will return to prison, according to the AP news agency.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or in prison.
A court found four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund Alemán set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is by
Yes, it is done.
The state budget is approved.
What's so special about this household?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it was submitted by Minister Sobotka (of that party) and the ČSSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally unregarded, yet highly significant law in peace.
This is a paradox.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is overshadowed by the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciated topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses under the previous Social Democratic governments which the 2008 budget cannot address at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure which is legally compulsory, not only for pensions but also for social expenditure, which the 'silent' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided on last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the municipalities.
The main risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and fairly under control.
The budget deficit of the municipalities is a real time bomb.
Many mayors, in order to find sources of investment other than tax, levy and bank credit, often issued rash bonds, which over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off this debt by selling off shares in energy and other utilities that they received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now that spring is already dried up.
In so far as we are confined to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been in a period of growth for some years now, which ČSSD is proud of.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, have far better managed their economies than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the previous governments.
We are among the countries least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Even if we have managed to eliminate some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that unless the retirement age is moved and pension reform is implemented soon, then practically all politics in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, he will have nothing left but pure administration.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that then ruling politicians will become civil servants who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
The budget for this year cannot therefore be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns projected for 2008 would be quite unnecessary if previous governments had not spent whatever they could over the past decade.
If we do not want to see the politicians in power become mere administrative officials, we must be patient and expect this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees, to be quiet in preparing further reform laws.
Only these will enable a balanced budget to be gradually implemented.

Banks trying to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
So over $100 billion will be auctioned off to the foreign exchange markets.
At these auctions, the banks auction off interest rates at which they are willing to lend money to each other.
For example, the US Federal Reserve is sending $40 billion to auction, another $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual countries have agreed on such a coordinated approach to defending or mitigating the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is intended to address the economy's greatest difficulties, namely the growing shortage of free capital available for banks to lend", wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report to his clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%", Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost about $60 billion in bad loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more in losses.
"The central banks must have been really scared of what could happen when they decided to do this", said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad", he continued.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, loans will become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another interest rate cut", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to the heating up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the collapse of the US housing market.
The debate of the ecologists is unbelievable
Global climate change is said to be most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN climate change conference in Bali, which was coming to an end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not green planet", he said that the debates of ecologists were unbelievable.
Klaus said that not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of government and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality is unacceptable.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a fireworks display of words that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed at the presentation of his book that the subject matter was very important to him and that this was why he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was being published in German, because "I often encounter caricatures of my views".
So now, interested people could read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus reminded me that he is not a climatologist, but he thinks he has enough qualifications to write such a book.
He was an academic, able to understand and evaluate professional papers, had experience in statistics and was also an economist.
He made the main point of the book that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, which he views as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
Asked by those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmental activists who do not consider the relationship between effort and yield".
Klaus had already spoken on the same subject at the Hayek Institute in Vienna two months ago.
600,000 people failed to change their driving licence
600 000 drivers missed the deadline to change their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for a new license so that the authorities can issue a new one by the end of the year.
The Ministry is not concerned that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid driver's license.
According to the authorities, the majority of those who did not change their driving license were those who no longer wanted to drive.
While small towns are reporting a sharp drop in interest in driving licence exchange, the capital's offices are being flooded with applications, and interest in the exchange has grown even more this week.
The city council handles about 2000 customers a day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
It takes 20 days to get a new license.
However, it is possible to request the exhibition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who fail to make the required change before the end of the year and start without a valid driving licence will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police can also issue a warning if the offence is committed.
In the event of a violation, the fine may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the municipality can also impose a fine on someone who does not drive at all.
He was said to be liable to a fine of up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to show leniency and impose a maximum fine of 1000 crowns.
The Minister for Transport, Karel Hanzelka, said that no one was facing a fine of 1,000 crowns.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which have not yet adopted the directive.
It is not an identity card that everyone has to have, and a valid one.
People who don't want to drive should turn in their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring it to the competent municipal office or to send it there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
Drivers are gradually having to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with 1994-2000 licenses have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this includes about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court reduces sentences for detectives linked to Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having colluded with the gang of David Berdych, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague High Court ruled in her favor, reducing her sentence by one and two years, respectively.
Initially, detectives from the Office for Combating Organized Crime were facing 14 and 12 years respectively.
There is no appeal against today's verdict, only review at the Supreme Court.
Mr Berdych himself is accused in this case, but he is facing a trial.
In other cases, however, he had already received sentences totalling 16 years.
He can't be convicted of anything more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for their involvement in robberies, and the High Court today heard the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants denied the charge from the beginning, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, in collusion with Berdych, among others, passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up various robberies and helped gang members to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Konyařík 30% of the loot.
The charges relate to gang crimes from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, which often result in serious injury to the victims, but also improper use of office and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal handguns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser sight, and a submachine gun.
The prosecution claims that the gang has amassed millions of crowns from its robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts found Berdych and a number of others legally guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet gone to court.
The main proceedings have so far been lost on Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and awaiting a final decision on their extradition to face prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the mistaken birth of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to claim 12 million crowns from the hospital in Třebíč, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, therefore strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high", Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to form an opinion on this counterproposal, we need the opinion that the other side had drawn up.
We'll see if it's even worth telling.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together,' Dostál stressed.
The amount should be between SEK 100000 and SEK 200000 for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jablonow wanted a million crowns for every month they didn't raise their biological daughter.
Veleba was the subject of a report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying severity, according to psychologists and psychiatrists.
The men were better able to handle the stressful situation, even when they faced criticism that they could have prevented the newborns from being mistaken.
The women, in turn, are less able to cope with the aftermath of the trauma they have experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district head of the Vysočina (Bohemian Highlands) gave each family 100,000 crowns to compensate for expenses incurred by the district hospital in Třebíč.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must have recourse to a reserve fund, but only exceptionally can they ask the institution for help.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to victims, the amounts being determined by tables and ranging from hundreds of thousands to exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost his kingdom Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the Ostrava District Court, although he was the first to use the name "Wallachian King", the project had built up a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor over many years of work.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is not likely to be closed and his client will likely appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitically trying to share in Bolek Polívka's popularity", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
When the word "Wallachian Kingdom" came to mind, everyone immediately thought of this actor and comedian.
I think that is the same view as Mr Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the activities it is carrying out.
He says it's a fight over money.
"After years, they have realised that the project is a success and that they could have something to gain from it.
They want to parasitically gain from our work", he continued.
Profitable business
According to the court, Polívka first used the term "Wallachian King" in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But this was not at the time a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From a fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystallized, which was followed by the founding of the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature on the passports, even offering their owners discounts on visiting his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manage" for his business intentions.
"Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom's project", the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had devoted themselves intensely to it.
The cooperation of the now-disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to pile up, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I. Elected until the Sankt-Nimmerleins-Day".
The leadership role was then assumed by Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother at Harabišs' suggestion.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
The contest for the throne and half a princess, prepared by Harabiš, could bring clarity to the dispute.
A new king was to come from it.
He didn't want to give details or a date.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It was supposed to be like the royal procession in Wallachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also sign up for this", added Mr Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: advantages are fading
To tell you the truth, I was never a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not of much value, the quality of the gearbox, steering and even the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The SW is a little further away, and I'm just gonna have to reconsider.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints are now gone, because the body of the station wagon is designed so that even two-meter men will not suffer.
Keep moving
I'll just go through the interior design briefly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, but I have a problem with the middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design where the car would otherwise look so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and the days of complaining about short seats or headrests are over.
The side-content has also improved considerably compared with the 206.
As regards the space available, the increased dimensions of the bodywork can be felt here too.
The lack of freedom of thought mentioned above is also eliminated in the cabin.
Bags in the trunk.
The main thing about this car is the cargo hold.
I must say that it is very well loaded and space-saving (also because of the folding back window).
The cavities are equipped with restraint belts, which are an ideal compromise.
They are non-invasive, easy to untie, and can hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the charging volume.
The table shows that the basic equipment is 428 litres, which is rather average compared to the competition.
However, this is not the case in comparison with the best-selling vehicle in this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is significantly behind by 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when buying a stroller.
But to highlight the positive aspects, I must also mention the very flat cargo compartment after folding the rear seats or the very low cargo area.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and a power output of 88 kWp.
And frankly, this is what a 1,600 cubic-cubic engine should look like to power a family hatchback.
It's quiet, low-power, and pulls well.
Compared to his Škoda counterpart, who sometimes looks as if his exhaust is clogged with a cloth, I can only be impressed.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still going up.
With our engine, it's $41,900 or so, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is striking again with an additional 80,000 crowns.
But we had a headlight bag, automatic air conditioning, automatic window wiper trigger, electric window lifts in the back and...
The car costs a mere £53,190.
That's a lot, but if you add up the extra equipment of a Fabia, you'll get a very similar sum.
So all that's left is to decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in UK schools fails
The number of children from Eastern European countries attending British schools is increasing, which is causing local people to worry about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even report cases of violent conflicts between immigrant and Aboriginal children.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the clashes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Quarrels, bullying, and bullying among students have spilled over into the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to the point where the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"On our way home, a boy climbed onto a bush and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his butt", a mother of a Slovak student told The Times of another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One local even described the conflict with the Eastern European immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between natives and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who have come here looking for work.
According to the report, some 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation will come true if you choose the right thing.
Gold and white beaches, high waves or a sea as calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters serving pizza, ice cream and alluring cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You'll find plenty of it on the Caribbean islands.
But there is only one island that has so much more, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba was their bastion for conquering America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a storehouse or transitory storehouse of treasure that the Spanish had looted in the Americas and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
I mean, you know, Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Havana was a city of high-rise buildings, with cars that were the iconic symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, celebrities from the entertainment industry and politicians from all over America signed their names.
What about today?
You too can sign your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
The bar at the Hotel Nacional will mix cocktails for you.
And the cult cars of the 1950s are still driving in Havana today because the once imported Chigulis and Fiat have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Magna Havana, especially its oldest part, has been greatly degraded, nowhere else in the area can you find so many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being cleaned out, like Trinidad.
In view of the much-needed money that tourism brings, the green light was given for this development.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another delicacy that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway enthusiasts.
Steam and diesel narrow-gauge trains carried the sugar from remote plantations to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you see neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers elsewhere have long since been in the museum.
Destinations of excursions
The most important places are not missed by most visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana anymore.
It is only necessary to mention that in the estate of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum, whose visit should not be missed by those who like this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, and their hollows have accumulated fertile soil that covers even weathered rocky areas with dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
It may also be interesting to some that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Other
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the ornamental beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has changed little in the last four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that even in the 1950's there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to its being overlooked.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was demolished, everyone was happy to have a roof over their head.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of the Sugar Factories.
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and where the music does not stop until the morning.
Other
This small town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly influenced by the way in which we are going to get there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo to the site must cross high, rugged mountains and a landscape barely touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List because of its pristine nature.
It produces the finest chocolate, the church displays the Columbus cross (in fact, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus' voyages), and the hill on which the former castle, now the Hotel El Castillo, stands shows several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to do so.
But as they say, it's better to see for yourself.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, the Americans claim.
The United States believes that the lack of troops and equipment is affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, in the words of Defense Minister Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go as they had hoped, as was agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries which have units stationed in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating countries are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called for more NATO forces, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is being made, but military might can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing their own economy and security", British Defence Secretary Des Browne tells the BBC.
90 percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years, according to the US Army.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by 60 percent.
The NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
The United States believes that the Allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of organization and equipment.
In particular, they are calling for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan forces.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next period and how we can achieve them", Gates said.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that's too little", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The countries involved have also been at loggerheads in recent months over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is minimal violence and the combat demands are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan non-violence exposed: Germans playing games while our boys are fighting", the Sun wrote in a post, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt will soar to a trillion in 2009
The Czech Republic has a national debt of 84 000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to incur a debt of 159.2 billion kones this year.
However, in early December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion, thanks to the better development of the state budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they have increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the national debt at the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the whole of the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not cross the one trillion-krone mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner", David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told the server iHNed.cz.
Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, shares this view: "We could exceed a trillion in the course of 2009.
Exactly when, depends on the next household we don't know about.
If it turns out that the political situation is changing and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change", he remarked.
Debt is rising
The national debt arises from the national government's debts and mainly arises from the accumulation of budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct borrowings or, for example, by European Investment Bank bonds.
The national debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The government's external debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased by 13 percent from the first to the third quarter of the year, which is a lot, given how well the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the growth is mainly in debt, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes", Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and the management of the public debt show that the government had planned to raise 159,2 billion kroner for this year.
However, in early December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to the better development of the state budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which is likely to reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated SEK 91.3 billion.
The Commission has also decided to grant a maximum of DKK 13.3 billion to the consolidation agency, a DKK 10 billion pension reserve, DKK 43 billion to the financing of government bonds and DKK 1.8 billion to the European Investment Bank.
For naming a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent deportation by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old schoolchildren to name a teddy bear Mohammed, even though any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained to the Ministry of Education several times, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, the matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class Teddy.
"The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all, it is also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the caption "My name is Mohammed".
The bear himself did not carry a shield with that name on it, but the problem is quite simple: the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and she would never have done anything that would have brought her too close to a religious belief, "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", saying it was just an "innocent mistake".
This view is shared by many of the teacher's students, who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "a person who never talks about religion in class".
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given middle name in the UK, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of homage to the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of that first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
The last meeting of the negotiating team in Vienna on Wednesday failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province.
At the End of Failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo concluded a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, unable to resolve their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to maintain peace and to continue talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
'No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time', he added, indicating that there were clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian-speaking, could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of negotiations since the troika received a new mandate from the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the Security Council's approval of Kosovo's independence, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
'Russia has been and will remain a champion of a negotiated solution, of a mutually agreed solution', said Botsane-Kharchenko.
A one-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration, Kosovo's independence under EU supervision is the only solution with a future for Western countries.
Pristina is prepared to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
'Unfortunately, no agreement was reached', said President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo Fatmir Sejdiu at the hotel in Baden, where these 'last chance negotiations' have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade was "part of a past that has led to murder and deportation".
The Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, said that a compromise was always to be sought and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" in a region weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
He said that the EU had to be prepared to take on the challenge of the future.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have taken two years.
They must end up where they started: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that "the Kosovo parliament will have the final say on the status", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be "in coordination" with Western countries.
Bush tries to get an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which he chaired in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "the terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding both sides of their commitments to the "roadmap" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aimed at a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central ones.
This term covers the three major issues that are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the 1948 conflict, which is now in the State of Israel.
Mr Abbas, after the US president, spoke and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be 'comprehensive and thorough' and provide a settlement on all points, listing 'Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security among others'.
Olmert, for his part, pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted "directly and without interruption" and that he would endeavour to ensure that they could be concluded before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his "vision of two states", one Palestinian and one Israeli, coexisting, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it received assurances from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
The Arab world, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
The prosecutor believes the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official stories and rumors are in conflict.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Police Agency (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
"He was not on duty but was on patrol, travelling at 40-50 km/h without a blue light", a police spokesman said.
A Kawasaki green motorcycle, "not registered, not approved for public use" (see below), was driven by two youths without helmets and came at "very high speed".
"It hit the left side of the police car after it ignored the right-hander", one policeman continued.
The alcohol controls carried out on the vehicle passengers were very negative.
The condition of the car (spoiled fender, split windscreen, torn bumper) shows the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the head of the department of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the IGPN investigation at this stage from the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police's version that this small power bike came to her left side relatively quickly".
Yesterday, some kind of crevice, probably caused by the friction of the footrails on the ground, left the two vehicles stuck together until the officers managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumor spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out 'any serious error' in this matter.
A police source said: "This is a difficult aspect of the investigation that needs further investigation and must be handled with great care".
Libération met an eyewitness to these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
"We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her", says this Witness.
There was nothing to do".
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youngsters, and the fourth called".
In view of the tension which had quickly developed around the incident and, apparently, the certainty of those present about the unexpected situation of the youngsters, the police were taken in by colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, rescue workers arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also used cardiac massages, but to no avail.
"I will not allow it to be said that the police did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her", the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police put down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, some 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the emergency measures in the eastern city of Lahore were injured by tear gas shells fired by security forces.
The men then threw stones at the policemen, injuring them.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios have occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were reported to have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court bar advocates called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of around 500 arrests of opposition, human rights and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the meeting.
Other demonstrations were reportedly held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northeast).
The movement was backed on Monday by the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "called on the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and to the rejects who took an oath to Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He was to take a position in the days that followed on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Mr Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"Everything we stand for is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court", the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to relinquish command of the army and become a civilian president "has not been validated" since the declaration of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to hand over his military uniform by November 15, the date his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy commander.
Still, more than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
Even today, 40 years after the law of Neuwirth, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned births.
The EDF estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or the IUD, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of women between 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, liberalization of contraception has nevertheless made it possible to improve "fertility control".
At any rate, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In fact, for one in five couples, the month is calculated precisely, and if possible, in the spring, the season when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular Repair at the Space Station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space performing the spectacular repair of a faulty solar collector that is vital to the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that set several records for its duration, the distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools "crafted" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon be used by European and Japanese science laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to power them.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-ton solar-powered power generation module that was already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to restructure the module's 250-foot-wide (76 m) solar arrays.
And what happened was that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like an accordion, was damaged by a cable that was stuck in it about three feet long.
The restructuring was stopped to avoid further damage to the manifold.
The astronauts, who were originally to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a check-up and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the space shuttle's 100-foot remote control arm, which had been attached to the station, to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
Tall, tough, very skilled, with a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old trained doctor was chosen to "operate" on the "injured" solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fastened a rail to the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "Spacewalker" who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulator to prevent an electric shock to the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, had been devised and "crafted" by the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the manifold to be fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today for their expected return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the financial situation of the airline.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris stock exchange.
The Group was forced to reassess its business forecasts for 2007 in view of the delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the financial situation of the airports concerned.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month backlog.
It should be recalled that EADS's operating performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs of the delay of another programme, the very large A380 aircraft.
The group had originally planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
The counting of ballots on Sunday will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will vote for President Putin's United Russia party.
After a very close election campaign, it confirms its desire for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses a message to the voters broadcast on public television, which has been recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the leading candidate of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is predicted to win a landslide.
Yesterday, the president made no secret of his reception with the foreign ambassadors, content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of meddling, his favorite topic during the campaign.
'We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections free from fraud', he added.
The opposition has made a mistake.
She denounces an election campaign tainted by repression.
Communist leader Gennady Ziouganov says there have never been "such dirty elections, not even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for unlawful demonstrations, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus"
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose the government and president?
Whatever it is, whether it is the parliamentary or the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their own destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Centre.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again adopted the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "freely renouncing" the personal responsibility they briefly exercised after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why wait?
This phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business community.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional heads) lead the local electoral lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
The conclusion of Tamara Chernidchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why wait?
Those in power are not so bad, why are they replacing?
A hard memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents in the archive, which cover a total of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have so far been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his family.
The 11 countries responsible for its administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to make it available to researchers and historians.
Following the completion of the ratification process of this Decision, the opening is valid since yesterday.
The Commission has
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research, "especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health of the forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, head of the archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents publicly available, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of concentration camp inmates or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their arrest, thus paving the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
You can't expect anything fundamentally new from these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India are aiming to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already close to 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its number one foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner.
A free trade pact will make a huge boost to the two economies' and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans', confirmed Peter Mandelson.
The European Commissioner continued that Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India.The Asian and European giants exchange '€47 billion worth of goods' and '€10 billion worth of services' annually, Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week, and regretted that trade between the two countries had 'not yet reached its potential'.The EU and India will meet for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi on Friday, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President Manuel José Durao Barros in attendance.
The report was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £ 10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England, concerned about curbing the current recurrent concern about borrowing conditions, announced on Thursday an unusual five-week £10 billion offer at a 5.75% prime rate.
 To alleviate fears that financial market conditions will be particularly tough at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about how to organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which starts on 6 December, in the form of a five-week open market operation, it said in a statement.
The Bank further explains that this will put £10 billion (€14 billion) into circulation on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the basic tax rate, and only until 10 January.
This appears to be the first time the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually takes place for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is 'ready to take further steps to maintain the 'interest rates' of interbank loans at their basic rate, which vary from day to day'.
The daily interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has stabilised at 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumours, and reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with more certainty
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to rejecting the text.
The text, drawn up in the context of a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary grouping), listed about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, most of them 50% on the employment bonus, the reintroduction of the TIPP flotante, a transport check or rent cuts.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main debate, which occasioned some violent exchanges of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present all its proposals as an amendment to the draft law on the correction of finances, which was considered by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America", said Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival will likely take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside of Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most prestigious festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took over the running of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people a year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been co-owner of the production, licensing and organisational functions of the Glastonbury Festival, which now seats up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn's are working side by side to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
"We have chosen Philadelphia as the market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We have been in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary location that will ultimately benefit the people".
C3 Presents has revived the 2005 Lollapalooza festival at Grand Park Chicago after it gained prominence in the festival world in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax days in 2007 respectively.
These two festivals are held in urban environments.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more urban green space", says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to somehow merge these two concepts to give the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban festival in the American way".
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is happy to take on the burden of this event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms that 'they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival which will hopefully have a long life'.
Charlie Jones says the festival's capacity is "very large", about the same as the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing has been confirmed as they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to appeal to all kinds of audiences", says Charlie Jones.
His partners on C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is meeting the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the mainstream Hollywood movie platform to Montreal when nobody less than the Terminator is up against it.
These lures are part of the delegate's job.
A politically sensitive mandate because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is denouncing Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You have to be careful because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer what you think is the best", he says.
The run to the festivals.
But for Denis Turcotte, the promotion of cinema there is his top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
Every festival on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's going to be about showing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers are interviewed.
The Dark Ages had a successful screening at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the Santa Monica poster and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four feature and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
The stock market is about to end the year in a rally.
With just under five weeks to go until the financial year ends, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the upcoming end-of-year rally.
Nevertheless, experts cannot make reliable predictions in this regard.
Banif believes that "statistically speaking, December is usually associated with a positive market development on the stock market.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and on the basis of statistics alone, especially when serious tensions are determining current market developments.
Although other experts do not approve of such a sharp rise in prices in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that 'the stock market price is determined by the liquidity of the market and market participants, who, due to the lack of safe equity funds, invest mainly in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the stock market will show a more lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, "especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve interest rate, an uncertainty mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the threat of rising inflation rates".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold moment to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish Ibex stock index has already lost 4% since its peak of 15,945.7 on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative view.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, the Ibex 35 could close the year with almost 16,000 points, thanks to the restructuring of investment funds and the traditional subsidy to pension funds, which is made around this time every year.
However, the expert points out that things could be a little different this year, especially because of the end-of-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus immediately after the bridge day to Constitution Day.
The analyst believes that price fluctuations will not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the current assessment of the market situation is at a near technical level, which could lead to a 'deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage crisis, soon to be apparent.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
The choice of the values to push the Ibex to new highs is agreed by analysts.
Solana of Intermoney says that "this year, the big numbers are on the line".
The expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies among the value-gains, "because the electricity sector will be too expensive at some point".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by a link with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit, said the expert.
In the case of increased consumption during the Christmas period, periodic consumption will dominate market trends in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also generate positive sales results, even if they are only present in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only experienced two declining price movements.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, it brought the stock market out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-of-year rally to date.
This year, when the Ibex 35 was up 28.17 percentage points, December saw a rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth consecutive year of profitability (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it will also show a year-end rally remains to be seen.
Popular will have its 200 credit bureaus open 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the Popular Max brand name, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to dare to take the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 8.30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours at its branches, has not yet taken a final decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not to customers.
The fact that other banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to the opening hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is precisely the intention of Popular's project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those shops which, by reason of their location, are able to attract the shopping-minded clientele of independent small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches in the next 18 months, as these are not new opening hours but changed.
The Bank will therefore restructure the premises of the branches already located in business zones, while adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of opening hours is therefore linked to a new spatial design of the shops, which is characterised by a more modern, colourful design.
The bank's representative, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring will not require major investments but will involve an increase in staffing, as a branch will no longer need six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept in nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The locations of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the name Mundocredit, which specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
These PopularMax branches will not use the BBVA model, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be in competition with our customers, explains Rivero.
They have provisionally agreed with Telefónica to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco has doubled its market value for the first time, overtaking rival Antena 3.
"We did it".
The Commission's proposal to set up a network of telecommunications networks in the Community is a step in the right direction.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: "That's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses", he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they 'did not fall too low.'
Telecinco closed the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This profit reduces its losses so far this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now stands at EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, halving its market value to 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed telecommunications companies, on the other hand, increased: Sogecable to 3.571 million, Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be inferred from the fact that they are two similar companies, Vasile said.
The question remains to what extent we can actually operate on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it profitable at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago its intention to become the first television station to generate more than 1 000 million gross revenues from advertising this year, Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company, told the press.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared with the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of trading (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from television increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor behind Telecinco's comparatively better stock market performance is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to date: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría arranged a 100% dividend payment.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio may still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares in Endemol, with Mediaset as the parent company, although it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise of paying at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always indicated significantly more.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we've already increased by buying 33% of Endemol's shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit forecast for Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is due to the reduction in the projected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% to 8,4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
It also reduced Antena 3's expected profit calculation by 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
Three options.
The first
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
- Two .
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) is in a more favourable position than Antena 3 (hold) because of the 'multiple incentives' and the prosperous market.
The third
JPMorgan: recommends that expectations be set back in both cases in view of the similar threats (saturated market and worsening economic climate)
The Congress approves the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the congressional resolution in the Senate on the amendments to the bill, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law, with the intention of allowing both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the members of the Congress and the Senate, who in their negotiations and votes had sought to establish the best possible system to guarantee the security of investors and to regulate the activities of individual entrepreneurs, thus guaranteeing an overall efficient market.
The MIFID, which redefines the securities regulation, aims, in addition to modernising financial markets, to improve investor protection, increase the scrutiny of the Spanish Securities and Markets Authority (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive will make it possible to provide financial advice to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and will also contribute to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIs), the advisory firms that join forces with investment firms and securities firms.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated markets will be supplemented by multilateral securities trading systems and international trading systems, which would eventually compete with the existing economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to disclose the main features of their business profile, the way in which they are confronted and the ways in which they deal with risks on the market and to register all the operations carried out, in order to facilitate the CNMV's control tasks.
The Economic Commission for the United States of America (ECOSOC) subsequently made further changes, with the US mortgage and banking crisis confirming the decision that the secured debt must now be considered a "complex" financial instrument because of its high risk to the investor.
The Commission has also taken advantage of the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of activity of qualified economists, 30 years after the 1977 Regulation which restricted the fields of activity reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, defined new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the commercial intermediary, who works for a third party, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer his services to commercialise products and to attract clients simultaneously to several investment firms.
The harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) rose by five tenths in November to 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union gives the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to provide local and qualitative comparisons with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be made in advance by using the same approach as for the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator determined early was only a guide and therefore did not have to be consistent with the final result to be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, Pedro Solbes, said that the rise in the CPI in November was a "temporary development" but that the price index would remain at a "relatively high" level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that "even if the current figure is not good", Spain's inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also said that there were "fewer surprises" in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
We expected a figure of around 4%, the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock to generate revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's holdings have fallen by more than half since the bank asked the Bank of England for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they now stand at just £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At that time, the bank's assets were a record £25,000,000, a sum that had fallen considerably in two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money was safe, and would continue to fall until the crisis was over.
Virgin, which would continue the group under the Virgin Money brand after the acquisition, would have to contribute about a quarter of the income from the UK banks' investments over the next three years to raise the exact £18 billion needed to reach its target of £30 billion.
The group of the multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its flashy advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin Group, which has three other companies, as its preferred bidder to help it out of bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested on suspicion of participating in urban corruption
Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the Murcia town of Totano (Partido Popular) this morning on urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo, who took over from Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and then chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, may have been the original mastermind of the plot, according to information from Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the municipal and city planning records and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales has been accused of being the prime suspect in a case of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the "popular" and therefore privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested while leaving his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents allegedly related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report that Morales allegedly paid a contract to a Galician construction company for the construction of a 200-hectare urban development contract.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a Socialist victory, will assume the office of President of the Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE organisational secretary, and Bono announced this at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party headquarters today.
The Prime Minister said the offer to the former minister was justified because in politics it was important to be able to count on the best and Bono was among the best.
The Mancha politician would also be running for the party's congress chairman "apparently" if the Socialists won the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would not run in the next general election, would end his career in public policy and would instead work in the university climate protection field.
The former minister had to admit that the Prime Minister had been pressing for his return to politics since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that the party, as with the appointment of the vice president for business, did not want to keep the citizens from knowing who would take over the post of president of the Congress in the event of an election victory, calling this an "act of transparency".
If he were to take office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a "house of respect and not of insult or scream" so as to make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Unfortunately, from time to time, it seems that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress; the President of the Government was interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times".
He also praised the current president, Manuel Martín, and "his good work" and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, as his political opponents would call it "arrogance".
The climate
As the climate debate is subject to a relentless barrage of criticism from both climate change skeptics and those who are putting a social and political debate on the subject in the forefront, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, like President Zapatero, places the fight against climate change above the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes a "new deal with the planet".
However, this proposal leaves him in need of explanation for the actions or inaction of his government, which has been instrumental in making Spain the EU's least compliant country.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, which sectors are responsible and why has his government, which proposed the 'Planet treaty', not stopped this development?
The Commission is also now obliged to present the Spanish people with a clear and unequivocal explanation of the measures it intends to take to combat climate change.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it provides.
Or rather, who will have to sacrifice and pay for saving the planet.
However, there have been no such declarations and there will be no such declarations in the future.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be used to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous from an electoral strategic point of view that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise so suited to campaigning must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of embellishing the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
This can only happen if the treaty does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana for alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" politician José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel manager, on suspicion of civil rights violations, according to investigative sources.
The councillor was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office, where he remains to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived from the municipal administration and the municipal construction department Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to searches in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid on Monday, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land were to be converted into urban development projects led by the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was to build 4,000 apartments on the land after receiving illegal commissions from the local government during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but were subject to an investigation initiated and carried out by the Totona First Court.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative sources, the former mayor of Totana and now independent PP MP Juan Morales are also under investigation.
His ex-wife, who owns a real estate company registered in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, are also suspects.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., the managing director of the Suelo de Inmonuar, whose company is a subgroup of Nuaria and who is alleged to have received the bribe.
The investigations are being carried out by the Municipal Authority for Urban Crimes, under the supervision of the Guardia Civil's central unit, whose representatives carried out 11 additional searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in establishments directly linked to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who was alleged to have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian community, comprising more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana to redevelop, with the aim of building a project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the car parks in the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela, and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, which is limited to the direct marketing sector; and Preconiza, which specialises in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
The first
If you agree, we will move away from the term 'Book of the Month' and try to invent a prize designation with other names with corresponding competence.
I already have a proposal.
People, life is about change.
Of course, you are welcome to make your suggestions.
- Two .
Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the forefront of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November, coincidentally on the same day as the issue containing the criticism of Blackburn's book.
The content of the philosophy course has become a subject of public debate following the tragedy at Jokela school.
The man responsible for the brutal murders is a high school senior who quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Philosophy Education Council, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical position toward Plato and proposed that Plato's teaching be removed from the sub-level curricula for the philosophy subject at high schools.
The third
A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months in jail.
But if you rob a music store for less than 400 euros, it is only a simple offence (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob a shop up to a value of €1,000, theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than for downloading (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than for downloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to share music data.
Involvement in an insurgent conflict carries a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Penal Code), while data sharing carries a custodial sentence of six months to two years.
The Court of Justice of the European Union has consistently held that the Commission's decision to initiate proceedings is not imputable to the State.
E. Under Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The sale of copyrighted films without authorization from the authors is punishable by a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone has really screwed up his demands.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles entitled "Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it".
So the feelings that come from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was carried out using a reference tomographic-magnetic analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn-based Life& Brain Brain Research Center, "activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed".
The researchers found that when both participants were correct and received the same salary, their brain activity was always very moderate, but when one of them received twice as much, their brain activity was also higher".
I am not quite sure that it really takes so much scientific effort to reach such a conclusion.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching relentlessly for the perpetrators of the Balkan wars for eight years, based in the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her term of office will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her post with a tearful and smiling face, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on a list created by Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film La Lista de Carla (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York at the pace of a political thriller as she sets out to track down the escaped criminals and pressure the respective governments to tighten their nets.
What kind of insurance is best for me?
Motor insurance covering a possible accident caused by the driver involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the right car insurance than the right model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insured person.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company shall receive the agreed insurance premium and shall in return be obliged to provide the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a loss.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance, which is composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher accident risk also results in higher premiums.
This is why both over-25s and women have to pay less, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate because of their caution.
The same applies to married people, since according to statistics and therefore according to the beliefs of companies, they are less likely to have accidents than single people.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
The insurance companies must take into account a number of factors when setting the premium.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation carefully to select the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points to consider when choosing insurance in order to make a choice that is not only performance-oriented but also price-oriented.
The younger generation faces many obstacles when choosing a cheap insurance policy, such as low driving experience and a "young" driving licence.
Even if a full-duty policy is the ideal insurance coverage, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The prudent driver can choose a full-helmet with deductible, so that the benefits of a full-helmet insurance are covered but at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer paying part of the amount of the damage.
"The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid", explains Luis Noguera, the main representative for Spain at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures customers against external damage but not against damage to their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a little advice.
If you are under 25, you can reduce your insurance costs and increase your credit by trying to drive safely and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has had a successful year, it can afford to increase the bonus payments", explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is passed, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, because the accident rate decreases with increasing driving experience.
The most sensible course is therefore to opt for a comprehensive insurance policy with own contribution.
 "Young people usually cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving", explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the 'fear of the novice' has been overcome.
However, for a married customer without children, it is more advisable to take out a comprehensive policy, of course only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows it.
The insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate and their contributions are therefore low.
In this case, a full insurance policy with own contribution (about 300 euros) would be the best option.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to start paying a higher contribution", notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a full-contribution insurance policy (about EUR 150) or an extended insurance policy, which only applies if the credit is sufficiently high.
Finally, it must be said that car insurance is very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidental damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection to suit our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow are hoping for a place in the quarter-finals in Milan .
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will battle for the point they are missing at the San Siro on Tuesday to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League group stage.
The Italian team has already five points and has already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points need another to ensure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not overtake Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two matches of Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will compete for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th to qualify for the final, which will be held on the 16th.
The Italian side will be in the lead in the group and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected result, even if both teams try to win, because the Italians at home will not want to speculate that Celtic Glasgow know that if they win they will be first in the group and thus have a better starting position in the round of 16.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even lose to FC Shakhtar in a draw, but it should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are entitled to participate with nine points of equality; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win the second game (2-0).
The Milanese will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who hope to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the second time in a row after being beaten in the previous season by a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0) and a 0-0 draw in the second leg.
While FC Shakhtar awaits the victory of the "Rossoneri", the team will have to concentrate on its own game, as both reaching the round of 16 and its UEFA membership depend on its victory and a defeat to Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lowest position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to play in the biggest European Championship, win the third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 people for their first tour since the band broke up in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was "excellent".
Around 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video was shown about the history of the band, which had caused a furor in the late nineties.
The reunion and world tour will be overlapped with the release of a new album, which includes their greatest hits and two more new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on stage, which were previously given to them by the husband of "Posh Spice", English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd of fans in the audience who were making the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him to do so in the previous days.
During the show's preparations, Victoria Beckham said the British star "has not seen our wardrobe once, so I'm very curious to see what he thinks of the show".
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal differences led to the group's dissolution two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
"I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I could see that the world's public attitude had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made this decision", Chisholm said of the band's split, which she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that "the disputes have been resolved and everyone is now very fond of each other again".
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
First, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will next perform in California, San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be performing in Madrid on December 23.
New fears over Russia-Ukraine gas dispute
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
The bulk of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) pass through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it must pay for natural gas, it will be charged higher transit fees by Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transit countries in talks", Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments about the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up sharply.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
The NHS must control foreign workers
The Scottish National Health Service needs to improve checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the monitoring body.
The recommendation by the Chief Financial Officer, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Public Health Service did not have precise figures on the number of its foreign staff.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were done correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Officer has investigated staff recruited from outside the European Economic Area following the attack at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV drove through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The National Health Service is expected to carry out pre-employment checks on foreign workers to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although Disclosure Scotland is used by health authorities to check criminal records, the Agency has no competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Auditor-General's report now states, among other recommendations, that the Board should adopt guidelines from the Criminal Records Excerpt, which helps employers with controls in different countries.
"Although we found references to these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out", the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities were following their pre-employment screening guidelines to a high degree but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign healthcare workers".
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment surveys of potential NHS staff would identify people who might commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that NHS Scotland's current pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide", he said.
The Scottish Health Authority says it currently has 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, partly because the boards of directors had problems identifying those employees who were on indefinite leave.
The investigation further found that established control procedures were largely followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
This includes passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines on pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: 'It was a matter of urgency for me to do this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.'
She added that the Scottish Government, working with the health authorities, would take into account the report's recommendations and ensure that best practice is reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment screening of all staff, including those from abroad, which are due to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards show
Control, the film biography of the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won best actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing British cinema to the world.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on its soundtrack - was made for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, it has earned the Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, two awards - for best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's thriller Easter Promises, set in London.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me", he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored".
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorism plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that were planning an imminent attack on an oil refinery as well as clerics and security forces.
State television in the world's biggest oil exporter said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, was planning an attack on an oil refinery in the eastern province, according to a television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect facilities following a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Interior Ministry, says 18 of those arrested were members of a cell led by a "missile expert" who had illegally entered the country.
He reports that the militants were planning to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were reportedly planning to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis from seeking to join al Qaeda militias that are fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen as heretical by hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clerics in Saudi Arabia as collaborating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last... five months", a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also involved a 16-member Medina "media cell" that aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus may reveal a glimpse into the future of the earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet is even more like an alien twin of Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and have similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on Earth, and scientists now believe that it could have been habitable.
But because of the unrestrained greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation, and a slower rate of rotation, Venus took a very different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planets for a year, provide a sobering glimpse into how the earth might evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar".
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment".
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people have been arrested and the footage is being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
All open
Mitt Romey said he didn't think it was worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately agreed to take part in a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters would video-record questions and submit them to be sent to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time exactly reflected the state of the Republican Party as it heads into the election next year.
It's not known, just like the producers of CNN who helped support the debate, who selected YouTube clips to show the would-be candidates.
However, the first half hour of the debate, the longest on any single topic, was devoted to immigration.
This is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a voting machine when they heard things they liked: The network noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke out against the boundaries.
The most intense and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontrunner, and Romney, who has pushed ahead in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of being lenient on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two were especially at odds when the questioner asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Smaller candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to match the issue.
Neither man has a serious chance of being nominated, but both are staying in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration cracks earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were brought up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Romney were debating whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the interviewees asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, contrary to expectations, in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to approve, he laughed at Jesus, saying that he was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race remains unusually wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising success and his roaring cheers in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have so far been unable to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate unified the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message of the greatness of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Labour Party's pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For a British scandal, this one's not particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politician's Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes licked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman had hidden donations to Britain's ruling Labour Party of over £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party had failed to report this, is something the contending Gordon Brown would have done well without.
When two months ago the Prime Minister backed away from the call for an election, insulting the British intelligentsia in a foolish way by claiming that opinion polls had no bearing on that decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly astute Liberal Democrat House leader, put it, the once-feared Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax laws have raised business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities was an unimaginable administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords in protest at cuts to military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and its former chief executive) has already resigned.
None of this means Brown is going to resign irrevocably.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they feel that it is impossible to govern.
People may not trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it's clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn't even need to be around for long, that delay is over: the public service begins to leak; cabinet ministers start to chatter; the press searches for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misadventures - like the long "money for titles" investigation of political party funding - voters might assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks.
The offences are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely conned.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The recent political donation craze is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his benevolence.
Maybe so, but he didn't have the choice.
The laws against anonymity for big political donors are clear, and they exist for one simple reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's deal but not that it was illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions, just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial officer, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He was quick to condemn his party's violation of the law, but he watered down that determination by reaching for a familiar instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to the full measure by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, like find a permanent chairman for the Independent Standards Committee on Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and move forward with a major reform of political party funding.
This would require hardliners in Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can win is through unquestioned integrity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's only natural that the dorsal fins will swirl excitedly.
Now that America's housing market is in trouble, the predators are targeting the nation's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both repayment rates and default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either unrecoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had withdrawn a $1.4 billion fee levy from its U.S. consumer finance, in part because of weakness among credit card borrowers.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and delays are still low.
According to Moody's, the third-quarter slump rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency law in 2005 led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus default fees) would increase again whether or not the general conditions for borrowers worsen.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
And trust in credit card-based securities is pretty strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, expects 2007 spending to be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the housing crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt now that home loans are running dry.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily cause a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be advantageous to the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage installments decrease when the value of the property is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also be much faster and more flexible than lenders in responding to more volatile conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans", says Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden underfunding crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and credit cuts push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future.
Keep an eye out for those shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to stand trial for their role in the fraudulent scheme with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud using telecommunications for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers.
The trial was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is the loose end of an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges initially filed against her in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron downturn.
The indictment against the bankers, dubbed the "NatWest Three", alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraud with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped drive the company into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others withdrew about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his role in the Enron bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in the Louisiana State Penitentiary.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was released on a $1 million bond, which required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer mask billions in debt or make failing businesses look profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, over $60 billion in market value and over $2 billion in retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Not down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least $54 million.
But that's a lot of change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can seat up to 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president".
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday for the Millionaire's Show, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption held at a nestled exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up booths, hoping to interest newly minted Russians in everything from mahogany-panelled yachts to diamond-plated car grills that would be reasonable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest exhibition stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us", he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets".
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas was in its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans got gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe, where they were considered materialistic", said Marshall Goldman, a researcher at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the most visible and generous money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a luxury industry conference this week drew Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who have a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are in the second class, worth a combined $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a group of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had attended the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian dealer, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-groomed and the men are all worth a fortune".
As they walk through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian shoppers who would be willing to stand for hours in traffic to visit a busy warehouse that shamelessly stocked Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in clipper-clippers".
In fact, dealers here say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from big-line logos to the kind of sober brands with limited numbers that wouldn't be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires, or simply tourists, thronged the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, said he sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton with gold thread sewn into them.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that provides high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three car grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble interlocking chain-arm tires for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a replacement.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather bikes or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these bikes", Mr Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage".
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in property prices there.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
"There are more of them than you think".
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red British-style phone booths crammed with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 fake bills for the millionaire's fair.
Passersby stopped to toss around the piles of money, take cell phone photos while they were reclining in the middle of the surrogate wealth, get friends to snap them, or just to steal a few million.
"Look, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire", Mr. Karryev said.
Failed surgery suspected in New Jersey fatality
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked out the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance pull up on the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's boxcar approach", said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died".
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, who police did not identify, who worked at the home at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine the cause of Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help unravel a mysterious death that has sent shockwaves through the top brass of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and persistent", Mr McCarthy said of Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me".
McCarthy said Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York City police officer who works for the Alcohol Enforcement Administration, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine if Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgery.
"That's one of the ways", said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation".
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh wouldn't say if Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes were hanging by hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing".
Hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates will lead to a rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by further interest rate cuts were bolstered by soothing comments from the vice chairman of the US central bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number two to Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that policy must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm sluggish markets, in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functioning from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were seen by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street, amid further bad news from the US economy, now that US property sales hit a new record low in October.
The impact of the financial turmoil was underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting move to offset heavy losses from its losing bets in the U.S. mortgage sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 Index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of British stocks.
Germany's Dax index rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
The re-emergence of credit pressures on the markets had previously been underlined by strong demand at an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks, which were awarded at a remarkable 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US central bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and inject more capital into London's money markets increased as credit tensions saw three-month Libor rates on UK banks' borrowing rise by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a steady rise since November 21.
England faces a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number six for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election committee, on call at least under this special title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national election offices, if not even for some part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth batting position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports is no doubt unfair.
It is never easy to pinpoint exactly what enables one person to reach the top of his profession while another never rises above the lowest rank, sometimes due to lack of luck rather than ability.
It's not just in cricket where choices are difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is this the right time for Bopara to step up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question may be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but so do chances.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batsman must get regular chances on the order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricketer.
It's more complicated to get the voters' attention.
There were many who were better last season than, say, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first Test even though Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and the wind is blowing in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs apiece to earn a place in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their high points and hope for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The election could decide both men's careers, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and was successful in the first, taking five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to establish himself, who made the breakthrough into a major Test cricketer and who, although he scored a double century against Australia in Australia, may still be underrated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following further discussion in today's webinar at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Shah speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class centuries and only six by Bopara, who at 22 years old is seven years younger, and an excellent record against a curveball.
But Shah scored just ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home ground as a Middlesex player, and this, coupled with his immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was healthy to reclaim his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his batting, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex jack of all trades has a shovel-like zest for life.
He is unimpressed by anything on a cricket field and his attitude away from it was brought to a head when he recently ran over a four-wheel-drive vehicle at an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (which was also sponsored, of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is a much better outfielder, he bowls his medium pace with some impact here on the pitch, which seems to suit him and he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean Shah might not look good if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he's the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a flood of displaced people who have run out of funds or visas, and others hoping the city will return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them from their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad", said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now".
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people", he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who ordered his forces to withdraw at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia had helped drive al-Qaeda from its stronghold in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a hand grenade attack after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I came back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop surge and the growth of local "groups of concerned citizens" who are armed and working with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced to return home by visa problems and a lack of funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government pressed to stop issuing visas to Iraqis to force them to return to Iraq", the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left".
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia neighborhoods and vice versa, creating many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and lead to conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even excels in the international orientation of its universities.
The Saarland has the same deficit in education as the rest of the country in only one area.
"I told a non-Saarlander for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan is self-deprecatingly posted by the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is ranked fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institute of German Economics in Cologne (IW).
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students here can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is therefore high, at 15.6 per cent.
But the Saarland also attracts higher-educated rural children - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used", says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, which is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively extensive.
The second best in Germany is the number of people who have dual education.
However, despite practical training and growing demand, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We have started a number of reforms in the general education sector after the first Pisa study", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
To help children start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model that other states are now copying.
Whether the students' performance improves in the long term will be shown only by future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of at-risk students fell from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not grow as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians are better.
And to the chagrin of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
The clock is ticking in Venezuela, and it's not going to be the same as the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez moves the clocks back half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a joke.
According to the official Venezuelan newspaper, a new law sets clocks to negative four and a half hours.
This gives the South American country a time zone that no other country in the world has.
The US-hostile Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed the division of the world into time zones at full hour.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the severance of relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this just because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe said his decision "spit in Venezuela's face", Chavez had criticized on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chavez is the talk of the town.
A new cell phone ring is making a splash in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that has already been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who was annoyed by the left-wing populist's constant interjections at the recent Ibero-American summit and had run over his mouth.
German workers face a 2007 wage decline
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to suffer a real wage loss this year.
Experts gave a whole host of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect to have less in their payroll in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is the modest wage growth, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy", said Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Research to the Bild newspaper.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take a decision on the application of the new rules.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to ask the federal government for loans or grants again, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the explosion in prices for food and mineral oil products had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Prices overall increased by 3.0% year on year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its inhospitable atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European spacecraft Venus Express has detected lightning in the atmosphere and winds at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it's lightning on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere, shooting lightning on Venus from cloud to cloud at a height of about 35 miles [56 km], reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "soup theory", lightning caused life on earth: storms in the ocean stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
"If there was ever life on Venus, it must have been very early in history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, the surface of Venus is likely to be almost devoid of life: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures can reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
"Venus may be the devil's twin of the Earth, but she is a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has taken such a completely different course is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of Venus, since no spacecraft has been on the way to explore the planet since the early 1990s.
The researchers believe that the latest research, now presented in several Nature articles, highlights more than the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that our neighbouring planet has more in common with Earth than was previously thought", the ESA reports.
The researchers found that in addition to the already known North Pole cyclone, there is a cloud vortex at the South Pole that is spinning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-smallest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size at 7,500 miles [12,100 km] in diameter.
Also called the Morning Star or the Evening Star, the planet orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it rotates much more slowly around itself: a day of Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature is 460 degrees Celsius and its pressure 92 bar, it is hardly similar to Earth's, but scientists believe that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
Both of them were filled with water, which was left on Earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
President Kohler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
German President Horst Kohler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present the outside world with a divided nation on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled his understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"For me, human rights are universal, even if I respect the diversity of cultures", said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a delicate balance in foreign policy, the German president stressed, but he defended Merkel against the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too", said Köhler.
The European Union has also expressed its concern about the situation in the country, which is facing a serious crisis.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
After the Dalai Lama's reception at the Chancellery, there was a lot of irritation in German-Chinese relations.
The Chinese leadership has not only fired the German Finance Minister, Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the SPIEGEL, has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has now asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China rejects European politicians in official capacity receiving the religious leader of Tibet, Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
The Federal Minister of the Interior called for everything to be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from spilling over into street violence.
Barricades burned, rioters fired shotguns at police: After the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development.
"We must be careful that we do not build up social explosives and turn into violence.
We must take this seriously", he told the Hannover-based "Neue Presse".
Not every young person can cope with the rapidly changing social reality.
The Federal Government, the Länder and the local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about integrating migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, this is already showing some success".
The Commission has not yet decided on the date of the decision.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in heavy street fights with the police in recent nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burning.
The German government has called for greater integration efforts, said Kenan Kolat, chairman of the Turkish community in Germany.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as dire as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under 25 years of age was 'above average'.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective".
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany "social control takes place in the family more than in France".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful".
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs intended for human consumption
Meanwhile, the night was largely quiet in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were on duty, a helicopter flew overhead with headlights.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has brought calm.
The police will continue to crack down as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
In the night of Tuesday, some 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots swept through Toulouse.
The riot started after a traffic accident that killed two teenagers on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the teenagers.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content - and that nothing more can be expected of her.
In what country does this chancellor actually live?
After her dismal performance in the Bundestag's general debate, which was genuine and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country she would finally have to govern.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy with a very arrogant phrase.
She said it was provincial, showing that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she has made it clear to everyone how true their accusation is.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke introduced herself: a detached politician who fled into foreign policy and found herself in danger even there.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed analysis of the situation in the country.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Now she's clinging to the phrases that the upliftment will come to the people.
It damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But under Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a fringe phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low-income?
She's got a few extra words for that.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to the child benefit.
It takes three attempts for Merkel to come up with a half-straight sentence.
She trips on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Division of attack
In the YouTube debate between the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, are facing a tough battle - and now they have to fear an outsider.
The tensions between the candidates are already released at the first question.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani responds with a serious charge: "I would say his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants", and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants privately.
The candidates are blowing up the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are little more than a cue.
"With this kind of isolationism, we brought Hitler to power", John McCain blames his opponent Ron Paul, who was the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a big slap in the face from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
But the campaign's main themes have moved beyond the Iraq war and torture debates, as the reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, applause burns in the auditorium.
This once again shows where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong then", Romney says, cringing, pleading with the base and the television audience for being one of the abortionists in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is puzzled when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian
A day after resigning as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had appointed with his weighted lawyers after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, an attack on a military convoy killed five soldiers and wounded four others.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Weed Drought Return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from their big time, "Live 1974", is out.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The sensation of the evening is then brought about by three gentlemen sitting at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits on the throne in a flowery white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Flanked on the left by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves over, focused on the console.
Everybody contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally goes with a conventional piece of music.
It seems that the gentlemen themselves do not mind.
The band's return to the music scene has caused some excitement among grass rock fans.
And I'll tell you what, targeted surveys revealed that while the name has resonated in the collective pop memory, it's not sustainable enough to make this band sorely missed for 32 years.
But why should not the Germans also be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called grass rock was always more true in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for lifetime achievement to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003, the audience was filled with questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the amazement knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother would later sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transformation abroad is one.
The memory is overwhelmed with harmony because the trio existed only two years and during this time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously collaborated with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a church-run record label.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then made a name for himself as a guitarist in Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Alte Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to be tormented as a nanny.
More like a pointed artist's life.
It is said that in the garbage a member of the singing group Harmonia Ottenstein was found and a name for the art.
Some of it was held back by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next one was called "De Luxe".
Because as calm and modest as the music sounded, the band was in need of material things.
Travel collecting was not just about self-discovery.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a recording studio of almost 50 people, as some people may remember.
Rother's desire was to push the harmonica and practice it occasionally.
It's an immoral demand from Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric sphere and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the '80s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessen live album is a tribute to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing the Krautrock as a genuine German contribution to live music.
New! has been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British alt-punk and author of the "Herb Rock Sampler" handbook.
And there's the man who invented the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This would outline the entire range of influences of grass rock on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia is filling the supergroup's void.
The phrase by Brian Eno floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future".
There are pictures of the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend is formed by projections of further black and white photographs from wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are back to improvising.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums to draw out the instruments' unheard sounds through self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy craftsmen.
The choir of the house doesn't change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, a cough and whisper will be heard under sound clouds and a beautiful place will be singing "Aaaaaaaah!" with emphasis.
Weed was always a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technology (power plant) or in the flight from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
The people who are calling '68' are not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is still not getting upset.
Even the most obvious thing is thought through on stage.
Where does music begin and end?
It can take your nerve or bring you fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough .
The Hunting Party and Murder Peace are two other films dealing with the Balkan War.
But neither is convincing.
Either the concepts are too much about action and cheerleading or they're too touchy.
Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can't help you with that.
The good news first: While the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is precisely there, in the dark backdrop of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s because too many nice, unimportant roles in women's feel-good movies and too many press conferences about Buddhism make you want to watch.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the main argument for watching "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted".
He provides a beautifully eye-catching account: Basically, his war correspondent Simon Hunt is what Gere could have been if not for the mercy of fate and the film industry: a man whose best days are long behind him, but who has retained considerable remnants of his former charm even as a ruinous monument to his decline.
But despite this triumph, "The Hunting Party" along with the German production of "Murder Peace", which also opens this week, just continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
"Murder Peace" is a short process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, whereupon one of them immediately falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that for once the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the television film is too quickly lost in the hype and action.
It's still a Cobra 11 alarm without the highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an exemplary exploration of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with a different director and another screenwriter (both in personal union with Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times, small teams go into the woods to accomplish something the military can't, and both times it's a journey into madness.
One of the reasons "The Hunting Party" failed is that you can't just let Simon Hunt be the lowly cynic with a heart that he's been portrayed as at the beginning.
No, the script has to include a romantic affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who was later murdered.
The Hunting Party will finally go down the drain when the reporters, in the last five minutes of the time-lapse procedure, do what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and let the Bosnian Muslims take their revenge.
It is so bad that you want to call the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they should agree on this occasion) of not pursuing the persecution too intensively on the basis of secret political collusion.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
It says of the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I look with compassion on the swollen frontal veins, suggesting how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have those same puffy heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the Balkan war film genre.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all of Hollywood's Iraq movies were huge flops.
I would add that there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always, when a star wanders around the world in the hot spots of crisis or minefields, it's going to come up with something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it would be decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably mature - the now-classic Vietnamese films "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket" were not universally hailed as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, even just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the thoughtlessness they need to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" were so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have the sarcastically distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel Lemprières Dictionnaire and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in horrible ways and there will always be war in Yugoslavia".
Beust criticized for cancelling the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing the possibilities.
The general manager of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation as "not good for the business location" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently given the city such a stimulus as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the momentum of sport policy could not be maintained to the same extent".
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach to it, "based on a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stuck to earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Association", von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games, expected in early December.
"This preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to 2028 that we have envisaged so far".
Nevertheless, the dream was not forever realized, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not be bidding for the Olympics for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to take a chance by burying the plans at this point", HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
The Court held that the Commission had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 85 (1) of the Treaty.
The Commission has also been informed that it has decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108 (2) of the Treaty.
The university sports association had only last week nominated Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD's Citizens' Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it put Olympia on the map and excluded housing", said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for an integrated planning for the Kleine Grasbrook Olympics and a later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally bet on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had caused great excitement in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg had failed at Leipzig, however.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you think of Sweden and a wooden box, you think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
- Is that right?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast a dark shadow on Warhol's catalogue of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo boxes a few months ago, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now lead to a sobering conclusion: The six Brillo boxes bequeathed to Moderna Museet in 1995 by former museum director Pontus Hultén are copies - and probably most of the other around a hundred Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 featured - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes: these did not come from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were supplied directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but models of them, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol apparently granted permission in 1968 to have a few wooden Brillo boxes produced in Sweden, which were not, however, exhibited at Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that have rightly entered the history of art and auctions as authorized original Andy Warhol brillo boxes with the designation "type Stockholm".
Some of them have sold for over $100,000 at auction.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 and that Warhol then left them to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at Moderna Museet, examined the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, as well as three from private Swedish ownership, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968.
The structure of the 1990 copies, however, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press sheet with a paint roll without grounding - and it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes", says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet. "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material".
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious allegations" made about the boxes of soap.
But since then, they have been in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a Manila hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
He cannot be held responsible for bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Loyalist soldiers had stormed the hotel earlier using tear gas.
The two dozen or so soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly sit down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently rushed to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyalist government forces have sealed off the area around the upscale hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"The people have had enough", said Trillanes.
"We're calling on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units would join the march soon.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Your government has been shadowed by corruption allegations for months.
The financial district of Manila was the scene of an attempted mutiny by about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after less than 24 hours because the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, the company said on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05% of the share capital.
There had been speculation about a takeover.
The option of increasing the proportion of Versatel is still open.
The move is aimed at consolidating the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Earlier on Wednesday, speculation about a takeover had already arisen after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf grid operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house only considers the shares to be for a third party, the financial market said.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
In the context of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies have also started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies will settle for a 10 percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to acquire another 18.49 percent, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies, however, kept all options open, in particular to further increase their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The months-long and still difficult-to-understand poker game for free internet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile subscribers and 1.27 million DSL and full-service subscribers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch has so far directly held 6.01% of Freenet shares.
It was agreed that Drillisch would bring in another 4%.
The right to buy the 18.49% stake in the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
