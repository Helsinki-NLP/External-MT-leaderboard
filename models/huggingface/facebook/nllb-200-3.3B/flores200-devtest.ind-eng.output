Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs were hairy, a theory that has been widely disseminated, but it can also provide details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is brown like a chestnut on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed stem, called a rachis, but had other features - spines and barbels - the researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature or appearance regulation. The researchers argue that, although this is a dinosaur's tail, the samples show adult bird feathers, not chickens' feathers.

However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road to the scene of the accident is temporarily closed and emergency services are evacuating the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court has been accused of killing his own son.
He's being held pending charges and a trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been tainted by the photo's widespread publication.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts view the publication of the photo as potentially prejudicial.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "a journalist seems to be walking on a dangerous path if he publishes photos of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is overall responsible for the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, would refer to the border dispute, which the Palestinians wanted based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reported were the future of Jerusalem sanctioned by both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years in the valley once the deal is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trials must be closely monitored by the guards as the trials are monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Park and Heritage Conservation Officer at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received thorough training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Provisional Election Council (CEP) yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of calculations to move the country towards new elections.
The probe was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the disputed elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
There have been 60 reported cases of malfunctioning iPods marked by overheating devices, causing six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the device.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified them of 34 additional heat incidents, which the company called "not serious".
"The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's reporting "deeply regrettable".
The earthquake shook the Mariana Islands at 0719 local time (21.19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said that no damage was reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said that there are no indications of a tsunami.
Former Philippine police officers arrested a Hong Kong tourist for hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old woman who wanted to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and started working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research shows that when given hormones, the fetal lungs mature faster.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even his fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer says, 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, 'Luna died on the night of her second moon, 'unique as she was, a powerful woman.'
"Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as scary as I was... maybe even more so... I loved her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll on this view, 34 percent of them wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness status was also in doubt.
He was unable to take the medicine needed to relieve his pain, as it was banned from the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets are the source of delivering water to Earth along with organic materials that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, since comets collided with Earth in the distant past.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
"He called the rumors "political nonsense and ridicule".
He speculates to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than older ground-based radar technology, to make it easier for air traffic controllers to pinpoint the exact location of aircraft with better precision and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and no diesel trains will stop at Wembley.
Concerns about the lack of transportation increase the likelihood that the match will be forced to be played indoors without fans.
A study published in the journal Scientific on Thursday reports the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations. Previously this process was believed to have taken longer, due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many forms, including being rolled into small shapes.
Gold could be drawn into thin wires, which could be twisted and woven, or it could be cast or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin, and it can be stamped onto other metals. It can also be made so thin that it is sometimes used as a decoration for hand paintings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton with its electron shredded (because the hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders into one, then squeeze into the balls with a clean, wet hand.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flushing toilets in almost every home, which are connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of the sewer system were found in many houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public baths, where men and women used them together.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive the call and then bounce it back, almost instantly.
Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and our view.
It would take a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to put a satellite or a telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the greatest thing it has done for us is given us easier and faster transportation.
It takes us to trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
The medium-sized cat below preys on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of a niche, a special job carried by each cat to keep them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
Females are usually closely knit together, like a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behave like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a human.
Tigers are still a group (Genus Panthera) with lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion with its full voice, but more like a sentence whose words are spoken in a roaring, shouting voice.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can, but almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and seek out prey by olfaction, sniffing out the tracks of prey on the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with their night vision, and they also move very quietly.
When a small group of organisms (small populations) become separated from their original main population (such as if they move to a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter environments different from those they previously occupied.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so these new populations need different features or adaptations to be able to compete more strongly than they needed to before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they seem to diminish like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they breathe in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time so it feared nothing but fellow mosasaurs.
Its long jaw, which is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, also has an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape when it passes through the mouth.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was branched, that he ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and that he was a cannibal for a while.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, including giant dinosaurs like T. rex that couldn't compete with it.
While most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans did have a share in some strange or unusual feasts, including boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a rat.
And when they eat together, they are not at ease.
Ancient Roman food could not bring the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Citizens would bring offerings to the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside which only the priest was allowed to enter.
Sometimes a special pyramid-shaped tower, called a ziggurat, was built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special shelter for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home is not so important.
Most Jewish family life takes place out in the open.
Women cook in the yard, shops are just open counters facing the street, stones are used to build houses.
There are no large forests in the Land of Canaan, which is why the price of timber is so high.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west found Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, despite his findings, the Eskimos were already living there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen a National Treasure movie, you might think a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence is written "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document in reverse".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in early times large parchment documents (about 29⁄4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) were rolled up for preservation.
So, that notation was most likely inserted as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles have liberated the north of France, but the south is still not free.
"The region was ruled by the French "Vichy". They were the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them".
"The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, in what was dubbed "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned on Germany.
Civilization is a single culture run together by a group of people who live and work together, as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and is also a measure of the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, the traces of culture that remain, and the distribution that is appropriate.
Minority cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a viable civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes. Because there is no national executive or judiciary, Congress relies on state authorities, who are often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also has no authority to overrule interstate tax and tariff regulations.
The articles require the unanimous consent of all the states before they can be changed, while the states ignore the central government so their representatives are often absent.
The Italy national football team, as well as the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the winner of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern region, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu) making Japan the 7th largest island in the world
"As a result of the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan in geographical terms is often referred to as an 'island'
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, and initiated a transformation in the practice of local grain production and hired Chinese laborers to work in its rice fields and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Chamber.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed so that tourists have a better idea of what the original looks like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still manufactured today, but more importantly its rationality has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS format groups) are equivalent to or approach this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds that is most often violated and underestimated is the simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is argued that the most effective place for such a main subject is the meeting of lines that separate the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During the historical period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which became wealthy and powerful) was closely watched.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their differences in language and customs.
His overwhelming power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to overcome suffering and poverty. The church's monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this centralization of power and money has caused many to question whether these teachings have been fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
As a result of the limited response to this tactic, the Germans suspected a similar response to the unrelenting submarine battles.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, many nations set out to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
In addition, at the interval of each dynasty there is a period of instability of the divided provinces. The most popular of these is the Three Kingdoms epic which takes place at the interval of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars were fought between the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political implications such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolute rule to republican rule, nationalism, and the belief that the state belonged to the people, not to a single ruler.
Moreover, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, opening up opportunities for success to the most ambitious.
The same goes for the military because instead of ranking soldiers based on class, they're now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class citizens from other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He frequently visited the cave that later became known as "Hira '" on Mount "Nur" (light) to meditate".
His self-contained, time-bound, highly vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find even when one knows that this place exists.
There is nothing to see but the beautiful clear skies above and the surrounding mountains, and little can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead has several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a majestic Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
"The "up" arcs look like a V and the "down" arcs look like staples or squares that don't have any underside".
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward squeeze usually produces a softer sound, while a downward squeeze is stronger and more emphatic.
Feel free to write your own mark, but there is a musical reason for the printed bow mark, so usually the mark must be obeyed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese aged 11 and Louis-Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of market ladies.
In a carriage, they journey back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and calling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forces the King and Queen to open wide the windows of their carriage.
At one point, one of the mob members waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The US imperialist war expenditure in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance most of the expenditures and interest on bonds floating on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are of course the basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the story, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The High Middle Ages are the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000â€1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages extended from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, ending around 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or the technological imperative to the strict understanding that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws as well as technological manifestations.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, rather than being merely socially conditioned".
For example, one might say that cars should lead to the development of highways.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also led to high rates of road accidents, which ushered in new techniques in the medical world to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had considerable elements of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the contemporary fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was once considered the capital of feudal European fashion.
Its fame as a center of luxury dates from about 400 to about 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century, especially as the Crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of Capital of Fashion was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the western style can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop their own style. One of the biggest developments of the time was the result of the Crusades, people began to wear buttons to tighten clothes.
Subsistence farming is the farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in self-sufficient agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that define a subculture as different from others can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture usually mark their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, among them fashion, mannerism, and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow into adulthood.
"Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some wild children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child neglect is due to the refusal of the parents to the severe intellectual or physical disturbance of a child".
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are thought to have been raised by animals; some people say they have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that cares for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a supporting aid to individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scaffold can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is the shape of a scaffold but so is the tiny paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too challenging for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including trafficking, abuse, and even extortion.
Children should not grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but that is the reality.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
Our child care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care should provide all the needs that are not present in the home where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The special characteristics of the Internet lead to an additional dimension in terms of use and approach to gratification.
"For example, 'learning' and 'socializing' are suggested as important motivations in Internet use (James et al., 1995). "
"Personal engagement" and "continuous engagement" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites".
The use of video recorders led to the important discovery of the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements, which occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it states that we can detect whether someone is lying by observing their microexpressions correctly.
In his paper entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how a person who was unable to understand speech due to brain damage was still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior in this way may be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, whereas selection removes them from the group of expression variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences, namely, growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant source of protein is found in leaves and nuts, but it's difficult for primates like us to digest, unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors coped with the 'protein problem' in a manner that is almost identical to that of the chimpanzees on the savannah today".
A sleep disorder is the process of waking up deliberately during a period of normal sleep, and then falling asleep shortly afterwards.
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to keep you awake without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock while you're sleeping, then the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing people to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force there is.
The only thing that's holding us back is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism took the foundation of Buddhist teachings, but then expanded them with the emphasis of Mahayana love and with many of the techniques of Indian Yoga.
At its core, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is evoked through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga Deity, through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. With the end of the war and the conflict of systems, processes, and cultures resulted in the collapse of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in the flesh, by proxy forces, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and re-establish along the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian guard after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has thus far been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Naval service is traditionally about making sure that your country is able to maintain its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, obstructing your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in WWII, where the Americans tried to move troops and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly used U-boats, was trying to prevent this jamming.
If the Allies fail, Germany may be able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for easy access to their milk, wool, meat, and skin.
The goat tended to be used by children or adults, similar to the more familiar shepherd. This method of herding is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the tracks were made up of parallel wooden boards, the horse could pull the carriage tighter and pull more weight than a rough road.
Railings were introduced early on to hold tracks in place, but it was slowly realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a layer of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused the wooden wheels on the carriage to break down more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railway made entirely of iron was born.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and with the emergence of Homo erectus two million years ago, humans began walking upright.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as it usually does.
Bipedal specialization is found in the fossil Australopithcus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact of our actions in the future.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want just temporary solutions, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to disable it.
It's pretty clear that the world is evolving because of science and technology, and overpopulation and the excess lifestyle of humans is a pretty big deal.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was taken several blocks to John Dunlap's print shop.
"Overnight about 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides"."
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
A lot of people don't think that they're dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen in the presence of open storage of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for a specific toxin.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with the rotten louse, which is an insect that is highly adaptable as a parasite on humans.
Both the Killer Beetle and the Mattress Moth are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in their nests or host houses.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal nerves, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is in their best interests, or in the best interests of their children, to raise a child.
The couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents withdraw their custody so that the other spouse can care for the child.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
It's not alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalist and philosopher focused on the classical texts and specifically on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, have been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge waned, the West found itself drawn to the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Much of the attention paid to rhythm in physiology and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-contained oscillator that will continue its freely running cycle period even when no external cues are present.
The Hershey and Chase experiments were one of the main proposals that stated that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a fag, or virus, to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They have done two experiments, namely labeling the DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus and labeling the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of a mutation can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cell is a germ lineage cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas to enjoy natural scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutan in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their work and intersect with others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In the shuttle, which is this dynamic transport, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on a private car.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has untied the biosphere from one of the stable states that for the past two million years has supported human evolution.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about the quality of water or collapsed bridges.
Why are there such complaints about the transportation system, why do their services always fail? Are the transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on today?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonably consistent and more or less mathematically representable flow.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to travel in space, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small-sized places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many believe otherwise; the solar system includes the Sun (and even other stars) moving around the Earth.
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and first largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's largest river, measuring some 9.6 kilometers [6.6 mi] wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the various rivers to the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of tributaries.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and perfection of the engineering of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
The ancient New Kingdom admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because all of these can be found in nature in their original forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all things are made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals.
You can also have a metal alloy that contains a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so incredibly small that a dot at the end of this sentence can contain several trillion atoms.
When it came out, the pencil was a friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of the pencil was degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to use a call sign.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will be when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, slicing the nucleus open again and releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that atoms tend to break up with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crustal thickness is about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There's probably more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner, and the lake is easier to surface.
Satisfaction theory centers on finding what moves people or what interests them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they grow into adulthood.
It analyzes the characteristics of people that make them want things, and the factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories of charge are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or the woman)".
Managers like this have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one person becomes an unrecognizable individual, who feels he has to change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behavior often leads to divisions between the leader and the team members.
Virtual teams have the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
"The presence of a real "stealth team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
The "silent team" is the management team to which each member reports. The "invisible team" sets standards for each member.
Why would organizations want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of the organization, creativity, and ingenuity can take place.
As a result, an organization's processes working together to solve problems can spawn new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation and share organizational knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognitive inquiry, and therefore narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavioral changes and some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structure and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as they have been built into some home computer applications and video game software.
Tours are an important part of school life, and often a teacher is happy to take his students to places where buses are not available.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classrooms.
Sharing travel artwork virtually is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with upcoming classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is redesigned, but the old version is kept online for a gluebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students typically begin to feel the experience of blogging with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, bloggers began to try to improve the quality of their writing to avoid criticism.
"In addition, blogs also 'force students to be more literate about the world around them.' The urge to satisfy the audience inspires students to be resourceful and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogs are tools that inspire collaboration, and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school.
"The proper use of blogs "can empower learners to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to Internet material, learners can define their position in the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it features art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are the untouched natural beauties of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of these things and a host of others make Ontario what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
The vast areas to the north are very sparsely inhabited and some are even virtually uninhabitable wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the United States than in Canada.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, and it flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
In the north, it borders the Sahel, and in the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: Female travellers are advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you also wear a ring then it would be very helpful (don't make it too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they perceive as harassment and not infrequently this is followed by a clutch on the arm, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to defend your opinions (cultural differences or not, does not mean that it can be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya. The city was later named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, pottery, leather goods, hookah pipes, and various geegaws, but all of these are reserved for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the extreme eastern region near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried much of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma must be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
It is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and some of the cheapest trips to look for tracks of the Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (boat) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~ 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
"Due to its relatively inaccessible location, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and distant land".
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was placed on the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
The site was one of the main stops on the PBS special, Wonders of the World Africa by Henry Louis Gates.
It is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, which are more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KN) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Buaya River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and is considered to be the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, it imposes daily entry and conservation fees.
It may also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to a select few parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong region and is a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart is made clearer by its reflection in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon beach across the way.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is crammed into the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for evidence of past colonial territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part of the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a swamp - it includes some of the trees that still stand in the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/sewage areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a haven for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus terminal (across the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
The buses are usually full, so it's best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by the small, comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster Bus.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de I'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 metres long and was completed in August 2011, opening to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the planned Brazilian customs checkpoint will be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group to inhabit what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous groups such as the GuaycurÃÃo and PayaguÃ¡, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
"In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Indian Giant Province", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups".
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of the Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known to have one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets to the polo match, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere throughout the island, in the town of Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted. Ask the owner first to confirm the payment method they accept.
Exchanging Falklands currency outside the island is virtually impossible, so do so before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer there coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the numbers on the thermometer.
"There is no 'rainy' or 'dry' season: the amount of rainfall is almost always the same throughout the year".
Although most of the animals in the park have become accustomed to human contact, the wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or harassed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from other wild animals.
No matter how small it may appear, bison, deer, big deer, bears, and almost any large animal can strike.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract the attention of bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval stalemate in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the U.S., and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the independence struggle run by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of an important leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position covering two harbours.
The North Shore (including the North Harbour district) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of its beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shade provided by rows of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes family-friendly beaches with nice shops lining the beachfront.
"The main local beer is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but a fun and refreshing one. The other local beer is called 'Manta'".
There's plenty of French wine to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wine might be better for travel.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're afraid.
For Australians, the concept of 'flat white' coffee is a foreign one. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a high cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many tours of the reef take place year-round, and accidents on the reef are very rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the coast and near the estuary from October to April above the year 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The saltwater crocodile is not active in the sea, its main habitat being in the estuary north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives travelers peace of mind because they are sure they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through travel agents.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also maintain reservations for you if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be made through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, most music festival participants decide to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the show, then you have to come early to get a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there are parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have a camping area dedicated to families with small children.
If you're sailing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, because when passing through the ice it's incredibly noisy, especially for those who are most affected.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city.
Casinos usually make great efforts to optimize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offerings of food, drink, and entertainment, to keep the mood of the guests, and to keep them on location.
Some places offer free alcohol, but getting drunk destroys the clarity of the mind, and all hard-core gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive in high latitudes or across mountainous regions needs to take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On a slippery, snowy highway, the friction is low and you can't drive like you would on a regular asphalt.
In a blizzard, you can get caught in the snow that quickly falls.
Sight distance may also be limited by falling or blown snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari refers to a journey by land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals like elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so standard equipment already allows for good observations.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes do not want to be seen and can be better seen with binoculars.
"A walking safari (also called a bush walk, a safari climb, or a walking trip) involves climbing, either for a few hours or for a few days".
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in a number of other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, after the first one in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets are worth about ¥7,000.
Many hotels have ironing boards and irons available for borrowing, even if they are not available in the room.
If ironing is not available or you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can use a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burns).
There are a variety of ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is considered sufficient, while in other areas it may take a few minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you are worried, consider buying sealed bottled water from reputable companies.
Tourists may encounter pests unfamiliar to them in their homeland.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread disease.
Self-infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their power, do not usually fall into the category of pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods that are tax-free and duty-free in a number of locations.
Tourists who travel to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on such products as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through remote inland areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp bends.
The speed limit is lower than the previous section and the following one - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is important to adhere to it strictly rather than the other way around.
Although, oddly enough, cell service is stronger here than anywhere else along this route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German dried pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbor, Austria.
Dry fruit cake is common, with apples being cooked into a dry cake all year round, and then there are the cherries and plums that are present in the summer.
Many German baked goods also serve almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts.
If you want a small but richly flavored cake, try between Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Curry is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
"Clay can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid present".
In the interior regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In South India and a number of other coastal regions of the subcontinent, santan is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, though Indonesian food is a general term that represents the diverse regional cuisine found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, serving a variety of simple spicy dishes. The main spices of Javanese taste are ground nuts, chilli peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The gurdi is a support for the driver's legs that hangs on either side of the saddle.
It provides greater stability for the rider, but it potentially raises safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's foot getting trapped in it.
If a rider falls off a horse but his legs get caught in the saddle, he could be dragged off if the horse runs.
First, most drivers wear riding boots with smooth, narrow heels and soles.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle's skin to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a fallen rider.
Nicknamed South America's Yosemite, Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochama Valley, has a series of cliffs and gigantic granite rock walls.
The highest part of the walls offers a spectacular view from the summit, and climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes between the walls' limitless potential.
The sport of downhill snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
"Skiing has become a major travel activity with a huge following of people sometimes called "ski bums", who plan an entire vacation around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The sport of downhill skiing has been around since around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is also called inland skiing, ski touring, or ski climbing.
It is related but not usually related to ski touring or alpine style climbing, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much sturdier boots and skis.
Think of the ski trails as familiar hiking trails.
When conditions are good, you can travel further than walking - but it's rare that you can ski as fast as a cross-country ski without carrying a heavy backpack on a neat track.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal conditions, travel to some of these countries requires you to apply for a visa and go through the passport checking process more than once.
