A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he does not know anyone who would want to hurt him, and says: "His affairs finally went well".
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galizia, the San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and that an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as a line cook at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "appalled and devastated" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close-knit family and will be sorely missed", the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank started staying in hostels, but recently his affairs were finally going well.
"He found an apartment and was dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected to his family was to cook for us, to make dinner, Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother, floating with the tide.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a diamond in the rough, shining brighter every day", she said.
Anyone with information about this matter, please call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
The European Union has a long history of supporting the fight against unemployment.
The representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to approve the new measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the whole Council to support new anti-working-age measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement reached with the BMA.
58% of the votes cast rejected it.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained 'superficially silent' on issues that she said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: 'In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement altogether and to demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns.'
In response to the government's silence, the JDC's board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorise a gradual and expanding workfighting programme starting in early September.
The controversy has resulted in six strikes by practitioners this year, including the first complete strike in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA medical trainees, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote rejected the terms recommended by the BMA, which negotiated the agreement.
He had told the members of the BMA in meetings before the vote of the 54,000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be dictated to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
A behavior that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the official end of an eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of St. Petersburg, I was clearly impressed that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, we shook hands at the event.
But Putin's smile seemed violent, and he was hardly a threat to warmth, even by his own temperate standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his dear friend Putin five times, according to one report.
I was freaking out.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the coldness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, blaming Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has profited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He's been very adamant about not doing this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
The benefits of a strict ceasefire are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost ousted in a failed coup last month.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also a financial motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been severe, particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will surely be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has been forecasting cheaper fruits and vegetables after agricultural imports from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here", as the Vedemosti newspaper report put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry at the West for what they see as a weak response to the attempted coup.
Add to this the long-standing resentment over the swift progress of the EU accession negotiations, and Putin emerges, eager to exploit the coolness and to undermine Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got a lot of input from Ankara, where he called after the coup attempt to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a relief for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in a lavish seaside palace made possible the Russian-Turkish-introduced alliance of the outsiders, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel they have been abandoned and mistreated by the West, by joining forces.
But despite the public conciliation, the two have major differences.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even addressed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-blown disaster when a NATO member, Turkey, shoots down a Russian warplane, it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
The bank's CEO said that the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from the hands of customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank's strategists have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been seen as right to allow the more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is available to Scottish customers, but it's not being restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references other than head office and stock exchange listings are changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that are gaining more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed at a tour of clients and staff in Inverness.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investment brand and employer for our employees because we are now becoming much more of a brand bank".
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their respective communities, and our people work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations and has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
'It is time for us to move towards brand banking because basically (we have asked) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers', said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of the customer, not our own, I think you're going to see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins the Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins
Dettori sprinkles champagne after a double win, and he has a total of 3,000 wins.
The racehorse Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved the milestone of the night with his second win at home, competing in the Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson. He's going to be a very good man.
Three-time world champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: 'This is special.'
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened at Newmarket because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's just a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humbled.
Dettori is sucking up to the cheers as he brings the Predilection to the fore after the victory.
Two riders have achieved this milestone in the sport of hurdles - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record-breaking career of over 4,300 victories.
Lester Piggot, nine-time Derby winner, has won 4,493 races.
Frankie is one of the best racehorses of our time, and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone that few have before him.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical wit sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a great ambassador for the sport, and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for the better part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but he's also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a brand-new flying saddle landing.
From flying finishes to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He has won dozens of major races, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from competition for drug use.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after a six-month ban from competition, but he showed remarkable fortitude in defying the skeptics and returning in top form.
And he may be in the race for a long time to come, and Dettori has said before that he would like to continue racing until he's at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to step down as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not give a reason.
In the same year, he was appointed as the Deputy Head of the 'Ivanov Group'.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
He was later head of the presidential protocol and cabinet staff, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the administration is to support you as head of state in drafting the laws and in managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin that was shown on state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the cameras' smile, few here are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once touted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with a very skeptical response.
In comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if you could even call it work.
Well, I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the assignment in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, the state security service that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time, it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after his second term, because Putin's third term would be unconstitutional.
But this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired after beating up a producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation last month at the set of the show in Los Angeles.
The producers of the series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and arguments on set.
"I'm sorry it happened", he said in his statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI team from the series will be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I've given it everything I've had for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there till the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team, and most of all, the best fans the show can have.
The start of the twelfth production season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
The mystery car ended up in a garden in Banff.
A man from Banff has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish could be wind fish left behind by the water bike.
Bain, who lives 500 yards [500 m] out to sea, posted footage of the apparition on Periscope, hoping that someone might shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends into Fife
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern span of the Queensferry crossing to the land, which means the bridge now extends into Fife.
It is the first of four "cantilever" locks now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hinges.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Finance Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: 'This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are witnessing all the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the gap between the ground and the bridge deck is a demanding operation requiring the most precise measurements to be matched.
In all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the final section of the deck is being forged into concrete today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure of any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of building technology.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the widening northern pillar, we had to close the remaining section on the northern, inland side.
This was done by pulling the northern runway 700 millimetres south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding operation.
It's huge, because it's 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled at about a 3% angle of inclination.
It was demanding because the measurement deviations allowed by the team were small, only a few millimeters in each direction.
But thankfully, everything went well.
Three men are lucky to be alive .
Three men are lucky to be alive after falling from their fishing boat outside Anglesea.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station issued an alert at 1.20pm BST on Friday after the crew saw the event unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried desperately to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, a lifeboat rudderman on the Moelfre.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we could move", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and the third, a 60-year-old man, was found exhausted hanging from the boy without life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal fishing boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men who were in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch, but it had somehow detached from the person who was driving the boat when it went down.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respected game of health and happiness.
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
During the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play but are spending their leisure time watching the screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and into some kind of activity.
Watching time was initially limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
So it's amazing to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm referring to a game called Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally developed for video games in the 1990's (and later on, a cartoon series, game cards, and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat waned before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was delayed because of the huge popularity of the game, which overloaded the servers.
In just a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, once found, can be photographed (by using a phone screenshot) or interviewed.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the wild and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, gambling has led to a significant increase in the average person's daily steps.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people who moved 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent of those who watched Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go. They only see the training data.
The appeals of many public health campaigns to 'get down to 30', 'get off the couch' and 'be active every day' have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and are given by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who are active have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people to go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, the resentful revelers look for things to complain about.
Yeah, someone could walk in the door.
So what's the deal?
There's been a breakthrough.
And while there were apps like Fitbit that used to track activity, they didn't give you a reason to move in the same way that this game did.
The appeal of novelty fades and the use of it diminishes with time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, other games will come along that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many people who love to hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles won gold in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of that.
Energetic in the jumps.
It's a good one.
It's incredible with the perm.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American athlete won the all-around championship on Thursday, exposing the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver medalist and Final Five team-mate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States in the women's gymnastics individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back championships in the sport of mixed martial arts, and the fifth American champion overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement puts him on a par with other top athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so astonishing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best athlete I have ever seen".
The final test was in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between him and the burden of overwhelming expectations.
Going back to my family's home in Texas Springs without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver medals (in that order) in the women's gymnastics individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Dec.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday, when he served as the pinnacle of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karolyn, at her departure party.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought about the future on his long journey to the top, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes his trademark voltage control - is set to Latin American music that would fit perfectly on the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a tradition, and who was found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother while she was on a field trip at the gym where Boorman was coaching, has become a force to be reckoned with.
He hasn't lost a match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance beam and the permanent, with Biles as reigning world champion, were waiting.
He topped the list with 15,433 points and surpassed them by scoring 15,933 per-game.
Raisman hugged her kindly as they waited for the final scores - a mere formality - and tears rose to Biles' glittering red, white and blue bordered eyes as the dream he once wrote about in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a kind of rematch from four years ago when he was tied for third, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the repechage.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, known to the Americans as the "Mother of the Storm", was clearly in the lead.
He sent flying saucers to the audience after his performance in Perm, in a frenzy of a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for the Bills, the widely circulated tweet from this 19-year-old earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police say three victims in a serial murder were shot while listening to music in their car.
In the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial murder case in a decade, the two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police release issued Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the road.
The report says that the gunman, who was standing next to the passenger, fired his handgun up to eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the triple homicide doesn't appear to be the result of a robbery, as the assailant didn't take any handbags or the $2,900 that the other adult victim had.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks in four months, two mainly in Latin American cities.
"This is happening in a residential area in front of a house", Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have driven a number of vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and are the work of the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were killed at the scene.
Witnesses told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that occurred just half an hour before the triple homicide, targeting an empty van, which is also believed to be the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings, bullet holes in the seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: You'll feel better
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike many of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do this. I can't do this.
I didn't make a commitment to this.
Which is not true at all. Of course I did, he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that I didn't know people still did it", explained Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a treadmill.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth, show us how Edmund's invention of the quotation marks is to indicate "will you sing to me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a normal sign language. He tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microcopathy can be caused by a number of different things: genetic, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary widely.
It's too early to tell how it's going to affect the lives of people who get Zika.
Picciuto recalls the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I just asked what's going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know, actually.
In fact, I haven't asked for a prediction in a while, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have Zika-related birth defects.
Things are getting better.
You can trust that things will get better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding triggered rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana.
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi were flooding their banks, causing widespread flooding due to extreme heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to counties in need.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they're getting requests for vehicles, boats and sandbags at high tide.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
Flood warnings are in effect through Saturday for much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that the region is expected to receive another three to five centimeters of rain.
A flood watch was in effect in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both in Louisiana and were predicted to set record flood levels over the weekend.
Environmental conservationist Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is lower than the flooding of Ascension County along the river, as the flooded rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at an all-time high at nine o'clock Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking people up from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that at the Beaver Creek, which is normally over 400 feet from his home, the water rose rapidly during the night.
He says another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising", Hansford said.
It went all the way up to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had never seen the water of the creek so high in the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members were disabled, and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said rescuers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where the rescued stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported rainfall of 13.75 inches between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain that continued until Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
The CBS affiliate WWL reports that in Tangipahoa, a city councilman said that 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now underwater.
County commissioner Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been stranded by rising waters.
The towns of Amite and Hammond have been opened to shelter for those evacuated.
"They'll be allowed to return home when the water starts to recede", he said.
In the city of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, about 20 streets were closed because of rising waters, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March", said city manager Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said that a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but so far on Friday there has been no report of any flooding.
Keith Townson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and it's still raining".
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was shot in the head, survives the Philadelphia shooting.
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, making it the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He was in a lot of pain, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe this.
At the hospital, the boy's condition is listed as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family will tell the station that he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first year at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car with a 29-year-old man in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooters.
Investigators are telling CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a crossover between multiple shooters at the scene.
Assault-type shells, derived from various assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shelves on both sides of the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here and they were in active combat", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are investigating the surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old girl was hit by a stray bullet in her hand Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's Olympic women's gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also consolidated the participation of black and Latino women at the top of the spectrum.
For the past four years, the most successful female wrestler in the world has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised us with an Olympic medal, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterful fitness programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back individual gold medals in women's multi-sport.
And team mate Aly Raisman took the silver.
We see the top of the game, but it doesn't look like it in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path that Aly and Madison followed when they made the Olympic team.
They are the Final Five because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts generally train in private gyms run by parents who pay for training, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Many of these gyms are located in affluent suburban areas that can support the sport.
These clubs provide gymnasts with all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring affordable and accessible physical education to the communities where the many young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my own fitness foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable physical training in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we're expanding to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality fitness for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop physical strength, flexibility, and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and academic and professional success.
This inspiration from the team is getting thousands of young girls into gymnastics, and it's amazing.
Participating in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to embark on the path to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical interns staging new strikes after rejection of Jeremy Hunt 's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 medical practitioners who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was 'on uncharted ground' and that even minor further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to their night and weekend working hours to improve care during the busy hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's medical trainees' committee, said in a statement last night: 'Practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it will exacerbate the existing labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally.'
With only eight weeks left before the first batch of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met by a reluctance to participate and at times a deep silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, eliminate the escape and address the concerns of the medical practitioners.
If he doesn't, the medical interns are ready to resume combat operations.
The last strike at the end of April meant almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 admission times postponed, as nurses and consultants were recruited to replace the doctors on strike.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 medical interns under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: 'Work struggles achieve little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a difficult situation, and cause anxiety, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families.'
Over the last two months, we have been in discussions with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the Guardian Role and the Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive discussion on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for returnees on sabbatical, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A two-pound-a-day medication can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a daily £2 drug after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
A medicine to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
It is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another stroke.
The NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England each year have a heart attack, and a quarter of these have a second or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a buildup of fatty matter in the wall of the artery, which constricts it.
If the ventricle ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks off, it can travel with the blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective treatments to prevent progression, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack later have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences".
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In recommending ticagrelor initially, we are pleased to be able to expand the available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
As the data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular regarding the risk of bleeding, for periods longer than three years are limited, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment beyond this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government's report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles is lashing out at the police, election officials and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of racial and religious oversensitivity.
A former community secretary, now an anti-corruption emperor, said that religious intimidation of voters is so serious that the police should be allowed to place security chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Now all you have to do is say your name and address.
The report even suggests that the voter should be given a permanent ink on his finger so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He called for greater press access to the Council's documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
'This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would also protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud', he said.
The report was commissioned by the government in the wake of the Tower Hamlets East London vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous corruption and illegal activities charges.
The court found that Rahman had "hypocritically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have 'run his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him'.
Up to 300 votes were suspicious or the result of a person voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of the fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the electoral fraud in the mail-in voting, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for the cleanup of the voting system, including the need to prove identity with an ID card.
She said in her report: 'Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in those communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
'Caution was expressed that... such behaviour had been ignored by the state institutions because of the 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to race and religion.'
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots to stop the collection of votes.
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for stricter checks on registered voters to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for identifying voters before voting.
Use the unlucky ink on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Carry out systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year time limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made postal ballots and envelopes in which the ballots are sent.
Have the police put up security chains around the polling stations.
Amend the law so it's easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that every voter must go to the polls alone.
Sir Eric is teasing the Greater London Police Force, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets incident.
'The Electoral Court was left behind as a result of numerous corrupt and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his officials', he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds, without a doubt, according to the criminal justice threshold.
He also criticised ineffective 'square-space' checks at the municipal voting registers.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's judgment in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birthplace of parliaments, but this disturbing and insidious spread of electoral fraud and denial of the facts by certain groups threatens this good reputation.
Mad about Kate's biker twin and other celebrity images at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have been stunned by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotte, who has been proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive double.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer to boast about his famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to the Kate twin found on the bike path, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer might be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison of the U.S. men's archery team has caused a storm on Twitter after images surfaced of him looking eerily like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, upon becoming aware of the social media frenzy, the archer admitted that since he was a child, he had heard that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except maybe the beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons to London in 2012 will surely come to light again this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafa, with her large, expressive eyes, is said to be the twin of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
A bigger twist: this user thinks that Nathan is the "sportsmanlike" version of the Inception actor.
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similarly strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shares more than just tanned skin and blond hair with actress Annalyn McCord, while the American team's Nathan Adrian is, according to fans, "a sporting version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
The tough women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very happy that others saw similarities
Theory: This user thinks that the similarity between the two may be the reason
Recently, a Twitter user expressed happiness that "some people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
And the American football star and Dexter's actress have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medalist Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful broad smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'dead like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the message of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, where 14-year-old Ai Yanhan finished fourth, angered viewers on CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television network CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its reporters said during a race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "disappeared like a bad smell" and "died like a pig".
The narrator, Byron MacDonald, thought his microphone was off when he began sharing some of his own thoughts on the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC news team to bring the color, was heard to say, "Bring that little 14-year-old from China, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam in the second half of the race in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online, shocked by the language and tone used.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.
Ai Yanhan of China was pictured in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay final message as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China was a little bit of a baby".
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was sharp and swift, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: Wow #ByronMacDonald. She was also a member of the group "The New York Times".
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist bunch. #disgusting.
Shortly afterward, Scott Russell, who was hosting the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment in a live broadcast, saying: "We are sorry that the comment about the swimming performance was broadcast.
That was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that it happened.
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
And my colleague, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
We took swift action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the record, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to define his remark by saying that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I want to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message", she said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
I guess I don't need to say that I didn't mean it as disrespectful and that I'm really sorry.
A customer at the mall was upset by a woman who brazenly adjusted underwear in the middle of the store.
The customers didn't know where to look when the woman took off her clothes in the middle of the Primarks' traffic to try on her underwear.
It didn't make things better that after she assessed how he looked in his pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually matched four pairs of underwear at a store located in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The first floor of the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where a woman sewed her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed herself again and walked out of the store without buying anything".
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own socks and underwear, and put on the fittings.
He didn't even try to find a secluded place for reconciliation, he just stood there shamelessly.
Everyone was watching as he took off his underwear again, and he clearly didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf.
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn't like what he saw, getting dressed again, and walking out.
"He didn't seem to care who was looking or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting".
Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn't cleaned".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: 'I understand that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after she left, which is good.
 It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they haven't been washed.
The mayor's representative said: "The mayor is aware of the incident that occurred at the Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th.
All the products concerned have been withdrawn.
This is how you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may make it a little bit safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrach, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with robbers who wield guns at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or from the back, this video shows you how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
Mizrach says if you're approached from behind, you should turn first to see your attacker and clear the line of fire.
Then you grab the gun between your elbow and shoulder before you hit the assailant in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting your knee against your ribs, and as the assailant goes from pain to a limp, pull the gun from his hands, hit him in the face with the back of the gun, and back away with the gun pointed at him.
If a gunman approaches from the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
Put the weight on the weapon at the same time and strike the attacker in the chest, then pull the weapon from his grasp, back away and point the weapon at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video, exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga Grandmaster, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Ian Wright, a traveller, licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a guidebook
A British traveller has put his immune system and vomiting reflex to a serious test by sucking on some of Europe's dirtiest and most night-ish places.
Suffolk-based presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, would lick euro banknotes, a fence at Piccadilly Circus, a washing-up button in a train toilet, and a Russian pay phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before each target was armed, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to enter.
However, the experiment, which was made into a movie called In the Footsteps of the Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the wash button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact the kitchen sink is more full of bad bacteria.
As Wright traveled throughout Europe, he spoke constantly to doctors and medical professionals about bowel bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with any bad taste.
Wright became known as a test of his gut's endurance as he traveled the world and ate strange and miraculous things.
This task, from the railway sidings of public railway stations to the flushing button of a toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said: "Since I was a child, I have been quite careless about my health, and I have put everything in my mouth, from dirt to worms to boiling water.
He really cemented his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public bathroom, he refused to shoot when the photometer showed over 4,000 units, and the freshly washed hand scores less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, In the Footsteps of the Inner Power, with Finnish milkman Valio, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the guy said, "This is about the worst thing I've ever smelled in the bathroom".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna do anything about it, because it's night-ish in here.
The internal power traces were produced in conjunction with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to boost the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of Snacks, Juice and New Categories at the Choice, said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We were throwing a lot of crazy ideas at each other, and we ended up thinking, "Let's call Ian".
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell you about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary is an interesting way to tell consumers more about it.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Director Tom Hakala added: "Let's put it this way: If Ian had swallowed some of the things I asked him to do, like the night-time Russian bathroom shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.
Understandably, some of the licking stuff was easier for Ian, while some was quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved.
In a 2015 survey, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid specifically to stomach and intestinal health, and 58% said that they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid has been added.
A homeless family destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before they were evicted.
A family of squatters caused £50,000 worth of damage to their rental house after they were evicted for terrorizing neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner, Shaun Trebilcock, have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being booed numerous times.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the shocked housing company officials found the property in poor condition.
Holes had been made in the walls, the floorboards had been torn, garbage had been spread on the floor, and graffiti had been sprayed on the walls.
The family has now moved and is believed to be living in a private home.
Conna McEvoy, the landlord at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to consider here, because this property is probably known to the less-than-comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property at one time or another, and police said that the family's terror included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive shouting, fighting, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was sentenced in June for disorderly conduct.
Many of the rooms in the threatened house were found to contain old debris.
The floorboards were pulled up from a property that had been used to smuggle drugs.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting in the street, and that the police were regularly called to the scene.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted the woman and her partner from their property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet in here. We're not used to it.
It's so good to see them finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the executive director of Cornwall Housing, said the family had not cooperated with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were called to the property often
Trash and old toys have been thrown down the wild walls of the rental house.
He added: It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own and his or her family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the brave community members who have given us the information.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the crash.
The housing company's employees now have to clean up the debris around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of cannabis, along with weights, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with intent to distribute.
He claimed the money was meant for the headstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner are now living as homeless people in a private residence in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house had graffiti on the walls.
Police say they're trying to evict residents who violate the terms of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This is a message to those who think their behaviour is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such behaviour,' he said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour and will continue to work with our partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet soared off the coast
Sun-worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced a shock of life
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion would sweep past from very low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not at risk.
Just at this moment, the terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
A dramatic recording shows a military plane coming within close range of sun worshipers on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see at first what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice at a very low altitude, and at one point it looked like it was going to crash to the ground".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew at an incredibly low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of a P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual because of poor visibility from the smoke of nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
This summer, wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low altitude due to poor visibility, smoke from the fires and thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Exto first half result better than expected
The Social and Health Department of South Karelia (Exote) achieved a better result than planned in January - EUR 3.4 million in June.
Exoto's profit was EUR 4,3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote is trying to reduce the number of operations.
The excess is a surplus to cover a previous deficit.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy treatments for patients.
The full year result is expected to be EUR 4,6 million better than planned.
The Executive Board will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Forces soldiers took their oath of allegiance at Immola .
70 Marines from the Coast Guard Academy took their oaths of allegiance on Friday.
A military parade of the Coast Guard and Marine Corps was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Forces Medical Course was held at the garrison sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 of the guards.
Special border doctors are trained for the demanding tasks of border security, intelligence and combat.
They're on duty 347 days a week.
This year, 310 young people applied for the special needs doctor.
They were invited to the selection tests.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The meeting was attended by five veterans of the frontier troops during the war.
The average age of those who were involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A district ahead of the robbery - Crime intelligence helps in the investigation of crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has had an RTA, or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The police department in Hämeen has a total of four officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The Chief of the Staff is Lieutenant Bahde.
In addition, the unit's strengths include a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinn.
Everyone works in civilian clothes.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit is producing a variety of reports for the other police.
In particular, it has obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working practices
The creation of the analysis units is the latest in a series of reforms to the police's working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less likely that police will go to the scene of a fight only when they receive an alert.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will help to direct daily police activity to where it is most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of one Crime Intelligence Centre, three national units and a Crime Intelligence Unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which is linked to the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, is responsible for national activities.
PTR units, as the name suggests, are staffed by people from the police, customs and border guard.
The RTAs, in turn, operate in areas divided by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local and national police forces.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit is tasked with knowing what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of one's own institution, because so does crime.
The people who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the regular cops.
The unit uses registers, alert database and observations to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, prolific crimes or similar crimes.
This is called a series, and it's one of the most important tools in criminal investigation.
Every human being has his own way of doing things.
The fingerprint is also visible in the work, whether it's honest or criminal.
The way you do it, you get a certain image of the perpetrator.
The ranking can be done either by the act or by the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
RTA employees don't walk around town with their collars up, but their work isn't entirely public either.
As well as the methods used by the criminals themselves, it is not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police efforts to combat crime.
The police shall disclose their procedures to the public if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
One such case was the newsworthy method of marking vacant apartments used in the early summer home burglaries.
In it, the creators put a stick, button pin, or piece of tape on the front door of a dwelling to test whether the occupants were really on the move.
The preliminary investigation material shall be publicly available at least to the parties.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest people order a court-ordered record, which may reveal, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time we see a thief, we'll leave with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppäs from Hämeen Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa from the East Finland Police, Crime Commissioner Sami Joutjärveä from Joensuu Police Station and Crime Inspector Arto Tuomelaa from the Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
The background is a reduction in the labour force and in the amount of funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The Commission notes that the aid was granted in the form of a loan to the State.
National cooperation involves the collection of information from outside the institution and the Finnish borders.
A London schoolgirl killed in Syria by her father
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has been rumoured to have died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organization's base in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to his family, he was killed just as he was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"It is only to be hoped that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a gravestone and a testament to others that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone - that it could make people give up making such a decision", Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she was widowed after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton would consider Garland for the Supreme Court if he's elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will nominate a person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a phone call Thursday that he predicts with "double certainty" that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "screw the boat" with a new selection.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are the "helpers" and "facilitators" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nudity calendar is for women as well as men.
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to publish a Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next generation of the top fashion in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, which is rich in nude photos, is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's theirs, too.
"We need to start presenting timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open casting events in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go? Who actually buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you start filling in the comment section with the irritating insults of a man with the nickname Not All Lonely Middle-aged Men, please note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-talked-about reemergence of records is not because more millennials are enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects but because of a desire for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought vinyl records are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group are the least likely to buy records.
It is also not just a matter of amateur collecting, but also of emotional labelling: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and to enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results accurate?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the busy Soho street, wearing a modest gray suit, pointing actively before I stop, forming a cup in my hands, and saying something authoritative like, "Let's look into this more closely".
Let's get to the bottom of this.
While the charm and dirt of the Soho are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and department stores now fill the buildings that once housed independent stores - a handful of fine specialty record stores still remain.
For the next part, I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment while I'm standing very close to different men in some of these stores trying to assess by observing their age and emotional temperament.
A 55-year-old Stuart from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (accountant: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (accountant: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes round the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I guess I am", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 discs.
These plates, which you can see in the picture above (he e-mailed the recording, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for this enormous amount of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back the ones he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the material I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that the people who buy the records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my bad.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit into YouGov's profile.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the media enthusiasm, people who have heard that records are back in fashion and who have become compelled to buy their old records back.
Based on my discussions, people have usually gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl records to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy their records back, he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl recoveries of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional impact of the discs?
In a store like Phonika, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded people.
Wez said that some older customers have been hurt, particularly by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be drawn away from the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar recordings, objects that evoke the happy memories of teenage years.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that owning things creates", says Wez.
I, as a collector, admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker said suddenly from the record.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% of those surveyed have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have one.
At this point in the news report, I'd probably look seriously worried as I'm browsing the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "reward" perspective of awakening is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at Sounds of the Universe (counting three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big deal, but it's definitely going to happen.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
So not older people, but younger people, late-teens, who are just getting excited about it.
The Fopp, which now has almost an entire floor dedicated to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned stores, the speakers are fresh with Wild Beast's fresh synth- and sex-filled pop, and no improvisation jazz, it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the sheer psychological trauma is hard to verify by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes looking at various records for sale.
He's out shopping for windows, not spending a lot of money.
He says he's not making much money, so recording is not really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is... she sighs in love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was trying to look like I was studying jeans, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering for a moment around Polaroid cameras before the father and daughter considered buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are mere ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely art vinyl.
But considering that the slightest attention to these objects could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of the Soho to get more, there's not much to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the population most likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's findings are valid, at least in Soho record stores, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be hardworking in school or in the office.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record shops, browsing records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy 30-year-old talk-television host who peers over the shoulders of misguided middle-aged men.
The Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal .
Scientists say that the holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says that the record is held by a female shark, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects request to unload goods from Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell items ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's office justified the demolition of the sites as representing a tax-free co-operative economy and as a fire and clean-up risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by the state-supported organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the camp's growing population.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 people running temporary shops, but said that the concern of the prefect of Calais was 'fully understandable'.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people in extremely precarious conditions.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a nonprofit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's coffee shop.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are as young as eight.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 - a peak - after arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall much faster than the EU average
Food is falling steeply in price in Finland, to the delight of consumers and the chagrin of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost 5% in Finland in three years, while the average price in the EU fell by 0.9%.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has gone up by 1%.
Over the last three years, Finland has been the second most food-price-deprived EU country with a similar level of wages to Finland.
Of the countries of comparison, only the United Kingdom has seen food prices fall faster than Finland.
The data is based on an article by Ilkka Lehtinen, head of development at the Statistical Office, published in the blog Tieto & Trendit.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices in proportion to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that EU membership gave us", says Lehtinen.
Then came the turnaround, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed by the Russian food import ban, which has halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
"Putin's policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", says Lehtinen.
The price has also been affected by increased competition in industry and trade.
The large retail chains S-Group and Kesko have both reduced their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
Finland is still not a country of affordable food, even though food prices have fallen considerably.
In 2015, Finland was the fourth most expensive EU country for food, with a similar level of wages as Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would be the third cheapest country to sell food from similar countries at a wage level.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the comparison countries were seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell food cheaper than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we need to halve VAT to the average level of EU countries and continue to compete on prices", Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that his calculations on the VAT rate are indicative.
School ain 't like it used to be .
Returning to school, you may find that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools and will be introduced at the beginning of the school year in all primary schools.
It is the guideline for all Finnish schools.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan outlines the official goals.
The new guidelines have been in the making for several years and differ in many ways from the old ones.
For example, the teaching of fine writing is being abandoned and instead the schools are being trained in coding.
Swedish is taught from the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies from the fourth.
The biggest change, however, is in the role of the pupils.
We used to think that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is an attempt to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-living vertebrate shark has been found - it can live up to 400 years
The ice-cold Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live for another 250 years, a new study reports.
The numbers make it the longest-living species of vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic stork, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females reach out longer than the dogs, growing to over five meters.
Because of the slow growth rate, recorded at only about one centimeter a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of the adult sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon deposition of the lens.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fishes in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have shown that ice-skates reach sexual maturity only at over four millimeters, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fires nearly 300 salesmen without reducing staff .
Nearly 300 employees are being laid off at the department store company Stockmann.
The cooperative ventures in the company, which was in difficulty, ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of some 300 jobs, the majority of which will be carried out in the form of redundancies", Stockmann said in a press release.
It says that the number of shopkeepers will not be reduced to avoid the impact of customer service.
In addition, about 80 support workers are offered new jobs as salesmen.
The Stockmann negotiations involved some 3 000 employees.
At the time of their launch, the reduction requirement was estimated at around 380 employees.
The reduction in staff will result in annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved over the course of next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme aiming at savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making a profit from the goods trade.
Although the Group's adjusted operating profit improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the goods business is still loss-making.
According to Lauri Veijalaisen, acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
'The staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018', Veijalainen states in the press release.
The improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter turnover and profit.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
Last year, at the same time, the total turnover of the Stockmann Group was 4,1 million euros.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be lower than last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be somewhat positive this year.
Friday will be the driest day in the north with temperatures below 20 degrees across the country .
The low-pressure center over northern Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, reports HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
The central parts of the country will also experience droughts, but the southern parts will be wet.
Temperatures are no longer very summery, with the country's mercury below 80 degrees Fahrenheit [20°C].
In the northern rainy areas, it's going to be 10 to 15 degrees.
The Kenyan national team is shaken by a doping scandal. A strange explanation for the coach's ploy
Kenyan track and field coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah had performed as a national athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform with is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of the Kenya national team, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officials came to report Anzrah to the authorities.
So, according to the report, Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, even signed the papers.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour", Kip Keino, president of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
The Olympics are starting on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich, who finished fourth at last year's World Cup, is a pre-season favorite in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan national team claimed that Anzrah was travelling on an athlete's credit card only to get free meals at the racetrack.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him for testing.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, fearing that he would be exposed", the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio's stadium is empty
Where is everybody?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, watching a sporting event.
The Rio Olympics began on Friday, but the world's top athletes were allowed to show off their skills to a bewilderingly empty audience.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day's matches and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening matches have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was filled with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have attracted attention even before the Olympics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the rugby, melon, and equestrian galleries.
When Brazil's medal-winners Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was filled.
After the Brazil double, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seater crowd was only about 30 percent full.
The lack of success is explained, at least, by the fact that struggling Brazil is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic Games are strange to football-loving Brazilians.
True, even the first game of the Brazilian soccer team failed to fill the stadium.
Mario Andrada, spokesman for the organizers, said over the weekend that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold, a significant drop from four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell", Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though tickets cost nearly half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening.
More than half of the tickets are under 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio, this is not yet allowed because organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less well-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
At the Rio stadium, there were enough empty seats in the morning.
Even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana has not attracted the public.
The dirty middle class competed in London 2012.
We had enough people in the papers.
A new way to protect nature - acquire land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is involved in nature conservation in the most innovative ways.
The foundation, which was set up last year, is acquiring ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem the rights to the land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire it for the payment of the landlord's fee.
The holder is granted a veto over his 187-square-foot plot, which means that in practice the approval of each holder is not required if the land is to be redeveloped.
You can also get the rights to more blocks.
The acquisition of a management right is something tangible that can be bequeathed or given as a gift.
No need to go carrying banners or chaining yourself somewhere to protect nature", explains Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the management rights for his enterprise.
The acquirer of the management right receives precise location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website displays the names of those who have acquired the land rights on the same map as the block information for the land area.
Leviakangas sees the risk of his conservation project only in the event that the foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation might act in some way that's unethical or commercial, but that shouldn't be possible.
The Helsinki Foundation's Holtija project is based on the idea of protecting natural areas so that they are untouched and at peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or by donation.
It finances its activities mainly by selling the rights of ownership, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The Foundation's goal is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and is planning to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities at the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Mall from 13 to 19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst in Turku . Look at your hometown .
Turku is the worst city in Finland to be hit by bicycle thieves.
More bicycles were stolen this year, as a proportion of the population, than in the nine other largest cities.
Based on the number of bicycle thefts reported to the police, the Helsinki News Agency found out how many bicycles and bicycle parts per thousand inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities in the world between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti topped the list.
According to police records, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, in Espoo and Kouvola only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"Some cities have twice the number of burglaries per capita", describes Tommi Reen, police inspector for the Police Department.
Turku police are wondering why the city is the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft may be affected by how much bicycles are moved around in the city and how many bicycles there are at all", reflects Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, of the Police Department, is quite expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to come out on top in the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely depends on which are the study and cycling cities.
The market is crowded, short distances and plenty of bicycles for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a very different type of city, with city centres far apart and the bicycle not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
In Finland as a whole, police have been informed of slightly fewer bike thefts in January-August than in the same period last year.
But there's no reason to be too happy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
That means 50 to 60 fillers a day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They are large numbers", says Reen.
In reality, the thieves take more bikes, since only a small percentage of victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report bicycle theft, even though less than one in ten cases reported to the police are solved.
The typical solved bike theft is one where the police get the information about the theft right away and the thief gets caught in the act.
"There are cases that are also revealed in other investigations, such as when a drug case involves the finding of stolen bicycles in an apartment", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week either in the act or in the course of a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
He said that bicycles are stolen from shopping malls, from their shelves, from their courtyards, from warehouses and from bicycle basements, or from virtually anywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual models of bicycles, the most stolen are Jopo, as in previous years.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term personal use, for example, but a large proportion of the stolen bicycles end up being sold, for example, through the Internet.
They're going to stay in the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been aware that the majority of the stolen bicycles go abroad", says Reen.
The police say the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of a used bicycle must be careful, as he may be guilty of concealment or misconduct.
"Alarms should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear discount", says Reen.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, always carries his colorful Nopsa during his working days under the protection of the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five bicycles, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "Never taken, so it's been a good monk".
"Maybe this is not so attractive to thieves, it may not be hipster-worthy", thinks Hirvi from Helsinki.
At a kiosk in Helsinki's Kallio district, Siiri Valve, acting quickly, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel is banging against the wall of the kiosk, but normally Valve locks its bike in something solid, like a bicycle rack.
"It's going to take a lot of thinking, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own", says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, which cost about $500 (U.S.) for the body alone.
"All the time, I hear from my friends that the bikes have been stolen".
"To pick up bad wheels, like the J-Dogs".
Valve himself was robbed of a bicycle in the backyard of a housing company a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve was waiting to steal it.
Under 15s for their crimes?
Helsinki tries out the US-known peer-review panels
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the experiment will be applied to those under 15 years of age, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
A jury of his peers will intervene at the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that a jury of peers discuss what happened with the perpetrator and then decide on a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator himself may join a jury of his peers to atone for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
The youth director, Tommi Laitio, says the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them are directing young people's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake", says Laitio.
The peer review panel is modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after a first offense, a teenager does not have to face an adult panel, but instead reflects on what happened with people of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a Palmu service designer who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully resolved.
Especially for first offences committed by minors under the age of 15, they may not have been prosecuted at all.
"It has been a message to keep going down the path you have chosen", Lovio says.
The jury is part of the Helsinki Youth for Immigrants project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
Over 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had received it to see a draft.
According to the paper, an open letter has been sent to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the dissent caused by Donald Trump, along with his indifference, incompetence and record unpopularity, threatens to bring a vote-riot to the Democrats in this election", the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds to congressional elections immediately can keep Republicans from drowning the Trump-ornamented anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing by the day.
Politico says the letter is scheduled to be sent within the next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is apparently Trump's anti-Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
Moreover, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working for national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to families with children in the US
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy Thursday night.
I'm running for president so the American economy can be a success for all.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make sure the economy is doing well for him and his friends", Clinton said in her speech.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve America's infrastructure - roads, bridges, airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases from the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a helping hand to American workers who suffer from the factories moving to low-wage countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We're building time, we have to get back to building!
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the burden on working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, by the way, when he said that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax haven, it has to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Now he's opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"[As president] I will oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
Speculation in The Washington Post before Clinton's speech suggested that Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program, which was unveiled on Monday, for "favoring only millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed massive corporate tax cut has been described by Clinton as "Trump's piggy bank".
On Thursday, Clinton emphasized that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton whispered.
This is the audience in Rio: The competition has not glued Finns to the edge of the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports events appear in television viewing figures as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a record audience.
At best, 12 per cent of the population have been caught up in the races: the Tuesday night swim was watched by 615 000 people on the YLE Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By way of comparison, the European Championships in general sports a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers at a time on TV2, and the European Championships in football a whopping 2 million.
The most interesting of the Olympic Games so far has been the Sunday night cycling and the opening day gymnastics, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel.
The general sports chief, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the number of spectators, recalling that for the first time at the Rio Olympics, spectators will be divided into several different equipment.
In addition to television, Finns are watching the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased that a large proportion of television viewers are choosing the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are split between TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports events to have a full channel dedicated to them.
When you're on the air 24 hours a day, and you're watching 20,000 to 500,000 people all the time, that's a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than the 2012 London Olympics or the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large proportion of the Rio Olympics broadcasts come to Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone considers it to be - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had won a surprise medal at the preliminary games, interest would have jumped up with it.
In addition, general sports are just beginning, as are other sports that interest Finns: sailing and horse riding.
Initial ratings have been close to what Pokki said they expected.
When the sporting world starts, the ratings will explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd wager we're already at 200,000 downloads.
"We'll have the online viewership figures later", Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not worked out as well as we would have liked for all the users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come in and the flaws have been fixed.
There has been a delay in the opening of the Rio Arena and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been released, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen on the Yule Canal and in the arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some sports, and on radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most labor-intensive ever for the U.S. but also the last to be watched only from the U.S. channels.
Since 2018, Olympic sports are shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep at Ristinsel.
It could be deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a weight of about 20 square meters on the Ristis, the depth of which the dive computer showed to be 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to confirm the finding by sounding a bell, but failed.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 m) and Lake Suvas (90 m).
The maximum depth is 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as thoroughly as the Sun.
The bottom of Lake Inari, in particular, has not been thoroughly mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths", Kannela reflects.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is the Great Volcanic Lake, 23 meters.
In this way, your Sun is not among the ten deepest, and the Saltwater is even further from the top.
Correction August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in the middle were wrong.
The tax base: taxation of pensioners even tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the problem came up during the parliamentary elections and that pensioners were promised equal taxation with regard to their salaries.
The government's proposal does not contain any of this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be able to be kept after the elections, he tells Western media.
Earlier this year, wage earners received a reduction in earnings, which eased taxation.
The issue was heated by opposition members in Parliament, who chided then-Finance Minister Alexander Stubb for his election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, not increased.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the following categories of taxation:
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment, if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo about the desire to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government.
It is a result of the efforts of the social partners, and it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It is necessary because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people's own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment contagious in the country
I think that the Commission should be able to make a decision on this matter.
The number of longterm unemployed in June was about 17 000 more than a year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will fall through.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand, at least four people were killed in bomb attacks last night and last night, Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand is at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has been trying to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to get information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No word on the perpetrator .
Westphalen says the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
The ambassador suspects that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country for protesting against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict is also raging over the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, in the past, strikes have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
He says the town is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The strikes affect the course of the day in a way that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police: Strikes are not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and were different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police, according to the AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have been killed in 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including in the tourist hotspots of Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the popular tourist destination of the Finnish island of Phuket, four bombs exploded overnight, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
In a popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both double bombings, at least one person was killed.
In addition, in the village of Surat Than and the town of Trang in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person was killed in each attack.
Many tourists also know Surat Thani, which leads to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We must not incite people to panic any further, he told reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators' intention was to destroy the country's tourism industry, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Europeans wounded
Very little is known about the nighttime attacks in Finland and their victims.
We've had some more information about last night's attack on Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and injured more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians are among the wounded.
Hua Hin's latest attack wounded at least three people.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the famous clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found one more bomb.
The governor of Surat Thani said the bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
The strike killed a city employee.
There's at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which went off about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded outside two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple sculls.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the Olympic titles in Rio in the long jump, pole vault and pom-poms.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics quite a bit over the last few years.
He's got eight individual world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the quadruple sculls and the permafrost championships three times in a row and the pomme last year and the second year.
With the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The Biles have some pretty cool World Cup medals for jumping and pumping.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Iskus has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's playground on the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more strikes, I don't think anything more wonderful will follow, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur, he has seen many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was the bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these guys haven't been kicking tourists out before, I don't think this one will either.
The office of the Hoovilla company is located a few hundred yards from the blast site.
The Hoovil heard about the attack from one of their own employees.
The employee called at about nine o'clock local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the strikes.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the road signs were put up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to the Friday holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere at Patong was calm, and the main street was allowed to open at about 10:00 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had never even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 p.m. Thai time, traffic in Patong was normal and many shops had opened.
Based on the impact site, the blast was fairly small, says Huovila, who was at the scene.
Later, the car was seen in the Crown Estate on Jouxholmin Road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
Patrol spotted two men matching the identification marks hiding in a nearby hamlet.
The other man was caught immediately.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of motor vehicle, theft and gross damage.
The police are grateful for the clues.
The Director of Research on the Russian leadership changes: Clear sideline
Russia's highest-ranking leadership changed on Friday after President Vladimir Putin fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44, of Estonian descent.
He's an ex-diplomat and he was Ivanov's second in command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the reversal of executive positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from taking power for themselves, independent of the president.
The fabric also suggests that Ivanov may have gotten into a fight with other senior executives or screwed up.
The fall of Ivanov
Ivanov, a Putin insider, will move to the special task force on environment and transport.
In a video released by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred and suggested that Peresko be replaced, Russia Today reported.
Mr. Kangaspuro says from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear loss of position.
Environment and transport are not very high on the order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has been a key member of the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the Soviet Union, in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but was succeeded by Dmitri Medvedev.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of transparency in the EU's financial markets.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's seat is that Putin is changing his inner circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields in their retreat in Syria .
They used civilians as human shields when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars and taken to Jarablus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters last week captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
But it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected from earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters were abducting civilians as they fled the city.
The Ministry of Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the publicity of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the publicity of documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior refused to release the list of participants in the events of the Minister of Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the Cabinet and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has seen a need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic appearance begins in Rio
As in years past, Bolt has been running out of time under the price tag.
He injured his ankle early in the season and missed the Jamaican Olympic trials.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better shape.
I've been training well and that's the key, Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press event included a few striptease dancers and reporters turned fans.
The noise around Bolt underscores the rise of the Jamaican star in an era when all-around sport has struggled with doping scandals and rising interest.
Bolt's previous Olympic defeat came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the preliminary round of the 200 meters in a time of 21.05.
Bolt, then 17, was a young prospect, slowed by injuries and a loose training posture.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at the 100 meters, where he broke the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite the final parade with a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the top of his career by a clock.
The world records set in Berlin at 9.58 metres and 19.19 metres are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his goal of breaking the 200-meter world record and breaking 19 seconds, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
The 100m's biggest challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the 100m at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
Last year in the final of the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt hasn't lost a single grand final in his tenure in Beijing, if he's ever been able to get on the field.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was cancelled by Bolt due to a fraudulent source.
Bolt's gonna be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's game, and the Rio Olympics are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the goal line for next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart from the rest.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself, this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Rio revelations: two athletes suspected of doping violations
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese drug dealer Chen Xiny's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian athlete Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping violations.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic trainer was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given us a doping sample with evidence of epo-hormone.
She placed fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estado, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample of Xiny's blood samples from Sunday's test showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have been other suspected doping incidents in Rio.
The BBC has reported that Bulgarian female sprinter Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample containing evidence of epo-hormone.
Kenya, meanwhile, has been sent to Rio to the home of the athletic trainer for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had impersonated an athlete during the test and had given a doping test to prove it.
According to media reports, the suspect is Kenyan sprinting coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the safety belt of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps will stop at nothing . Historic gold has come to the showroom .
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam the 200-meter medley in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same event in four consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan placed second in the mixing before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and the BBC's Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with the Evening Post.
The story about Helen Skelton (O.K.) on Monday is one of the most read stories on the Evening Post website this week.
Next to me is the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if there's a little fuss in the press or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
After all, television is a visual medium, he insists.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress, which is certainly at least sufficiently revealing - at least in the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
But there is no backward step.
It's important to look good, and small boobs are just a fun thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to tone down and maybe even shock, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
He says, "This isn't about me.
We're here to watch a sport, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the boom has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that puts the spotlight on how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big the sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what, man?
It's a thing of the past when it comes to the way the presenter dresses.
I'm a little amused if this has hit anyone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests on terrorism charges.
Rio police announced Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests during the security surveillance of the games.
The police made five other arrests in connection with the same incident and interrogated two persons before releasing them.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, the individuals arrested for terrorism are part of the same group whose members were arrested by police in July.
The suspects are believed to have links to the Islamic State group.
The arrested were known to have incited violence on social media.
In the past, the group has been involved in the campaign against the death penalty.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Olympics.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their opening match of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed it to the public.
Police allowed the public in after they had controlled the detonation of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police have carried out a controlled bombing mission.
Police have closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was allowed in after the police had controlled the detonation of the package.
The crowd did not arrive in the theater by the time the game started because the police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and only then did they allow the public into the hall.
The drink woke the Spanish team, who had started the race in a sleepy manner.
Spain, who started the tournament with two defeats, beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the last two games, Spain won silver.
Police have carried out a controlled bombing mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time the police had to blow up a suspicious find near the finish line of a road bike ride was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria opened their opening match of the Rio basketball tournament in front of an empty crowd.
Argentinian lady beat up the Cheating Siren - Finnish thought protest
The wind at the Cheating Sirens was a colorful day at the Rio de Janeiro competition.
The winds in the Cheater Mountain were pretty rough Thursday.
The Argentine lady wore the Wind-Treater Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted to the violation.
He was stuck in the crash, and the others ran away, said Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been useless according to Olympic rules.
"I should have fallen into the water to be repaid", said the Cheating Siren.
The Finn hung on his board until the end because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was 27th when he started.
In the overall standings, the 2012 London Olympics silver medalist is eighth.
The crash didn't do much for the skull.
Friday is a big day, with the race from 10 to 12.
Modified 0.39: Contrary to initial reports, the Cheating Siren did not protest.
7 weird things that science says will prolong your life
Science has explored everything possible between earth and sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of these are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health, prolonging his life.
On the other hand, sometimes things beyond a person's control can add years to his life.
These include the tendency to be overweight or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't always have to do the trick. Just get the milk carton.
Many studies have been conducted to uncover the secret of longevity.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest findings.
Science says that all of these things can add years to your life.
Drinking Beer and Coffee
Drinking coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death", especially in neurological or cardiac diseases.
In favor of alcohol, studies show that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one study found that people who drank wine lived longer than people who drank none at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can extend a person's life by as much as six years, says one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents the development of sinus infections.
In turn, they can contribute to the spread of other diseases in other parts of the human body.
A study in Norway found that laughter affected the length of a person's life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to survive the experiment than those who laughed less.
Sex, when it is associated with protection against STDs, is shown by many studies to be beneficial to health.
More than that, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
To add years to a person's life, he must also have an orgasm.
Exercise is a lifetime, there's no denying that.
But achieving longevity does not require absolute sobriety.
In fact, a study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to low-fat mortality.
Whether an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than the average man.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, doubt that longevity is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible for him to achieve such accolades as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behavior of people over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily is less likely to be a shopping parent.
This is because walking around in shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause premature death.
So, count the credit card from your hand - so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
A drunk driver with a bad temper slid into a truck.
A serious collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koske, Finland, on Friday evening.
The accident happened in Kosk, between Koskenti and Sorvastonti on Friday at 9pm.
The truck had been heading towards Forssa when the passenger car encountered had driven into the same lane, hitting the truck at the right angle.
The truck was left in the lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
A van slid into a ditch and then went over the ditch to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 driving a passenger car was crushed in her car.
The rescue team detached the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
She had a breath test of 2.02 per milliliters.
He's on suspicion of gross DUI.
The post office sent the candy bars to the wrong city.
The Salon K-Citymarket's range of unbleached candies was deficient because the post office had delivered part of the cargo to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernio, was buying candy at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately, the unloading forms are defective because the Post Office delivered our shipment to Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the shipment!
So unless there's a traffic jam in the lawn mower, the sign says,
The sign on the shop window is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include lawn mowing.
The Post will be offering lawn mowers until the end of August.
Elti thought the sign was mostly funny, and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update knocked me out.
The media has been calling all the time, and the attention this has attracted is incredible, Halti wonders.
By Friday night, the Haltia update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
The Elf got his own favorite to be caught in a bag of chocolates, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the transport services business of the Post Office, expressed his regret at the loss to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were lost yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we did not go to do the submission (Saloon) with three, but we took five stages only today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first news story was in the Evening News.
Mr. Elt didn't mind the sign, because he found all his own free-range confectionery in the pantry.
Lotta Backlund, who lost 30 pounds, posted a picture of her transformation.
A comedy producer has lost a ton of weight since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of her life-changing experience.
Lotta shared a couple of photos of her transformation on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness regimen, aiming for a normal weight.
The Backlund lot in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss career back in 2009.
He's made a complete lifestyle change and has quietly lost a little over 100 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
The Backlund before and after photographs have garnered a number of compliments from national conciliators.
You are amazing.
We're on the same path, motivation is strong!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
Your pictures give me tremendous strength and passion, when I'm in heaven myself on the same journey, told by another.
In the spring, Lotta lost the last of her weight on the Do It Now project.
At that time he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which at the time was about ten kilograms.
After three months of exercise, I lost five pounds.
The family of a woman murdered in the Lowice: memories of the victim for the police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa last week hopes that instead of flowers and addresses, the victim will be remembered by a donation to the police dog charity.
The Sipoon Veterinary Hospital has posted a Facebook post, in which it shares the victim's family's wish for donations for the police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoon Veterinary Hospital and had also completed her nursing internship there.
The vet's office remembers her in touching words.
Cheerful, smart, with a sense of humor and no fear of work.
My good friend.
We still can't fully comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go entirely to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of security dogs.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkyla.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Standard that the victim was a very animal-loving man.
He owned a number of animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a hen.
The 27-year-old suspect in the murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection.
The killer's tracking included a police dog named Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal ruled against Post for breach of the Equality Act
The Postal Service had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to inform the hired worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court ruled in its judgment.
The Court of Appeal ordered Post to pay the employee the majority of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the apprentice's salary which corresponded to the apprentice's share of the whole day's work.
The Court of Appeal held that the employee had been placed at a disadvantage by reason of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The worker had complied with the organisation decision of the PAU, the Postal and Logistics Union, prohibiting him from making inquiries.
During the postal strike last November, the PAU made a decision that postal workers would not be interviewed for hired workers who broke the strike.
The People's News first reported the incident.
Turkey must return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (PS) wrote in their reply to the Journalists' Union.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the UN Charter on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The Union of Journalists had earlier asked Sipil and Soini in a letter to express their concern about freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly stressed the importance of freedom of the press and expression in Turkey.
Putin replaced his administration with the head of the Estonian-style Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is replaced by Anton Vaino, the grandson of Soviet Communist leader Karl Vaino.
He is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution also includes a member of Russia's Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a close associate of Putin, will be transferred to the special task force on environment and transport, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other roles and suggested that Peresko be replaced, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB's espionage.
Many people considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
ManU 's giant bid for the game ban will not be seen at the opening of the Valioliiga
The world record holder in transfer fees will not be seen on the field as the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed his trip to England.
Manchester United giant Paul Pogba is out of action for the game as ManU opens their season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Pogba to Juventus, the Italian side, for €105 million, according to British media.
However, the FA has kept him out of the game, as Pogba has been burdened with a suspension from Juventus.
He got two warnings at the Italian Cup last season, and that's a one-game suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next game is in the second round of the league on August 19th, when ManU will face Southampton.
At Flow, the madness of greatness is a virtue.
The strict criteria of entertainment and ambitious visions have cemented Flow Festival's status as an internationally acclaimed event targeted by the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
The partygoers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the top artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area is decorated with, among other things, artificial turf and art installations.
"We've never had enough of just having a main stage and a beer tent", says artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which takes place this weekend in Helsinki's Summer Garden, has grown from a small street festival to an event with tens of thousands of visitors.
The success of the event is based on a simple question: What kind of event would the creators themselves like to attend?
It's kind of weird in event production to think like this.
The aim is often to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the authorities' orders, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 from last year's 70,000.
This year, the festival will again feature a number of interesting local and international artists.
The increase in the number of visits is a good thing, because there is a way to finance what is being done.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too big, because at some point the mass will be like a cattle train being driven along huge paths.
We don't want that.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over the past 13 years to include 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars, partly decorated with artifacts.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year's venue will be a 15,000-person tent.
Kallio admits that the event could be done in a simpler way.
I may be a bit of a bigot, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve the spirit of Flow.
If we lose it, this is no longer our business.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio is that even grand visions are now practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, its operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of around EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the public limited company operating Flow was about EUR 6 million.
It can be used to do "circular things", such as building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's guests have typically expressed themselves in distinctive attire.
In addition to the music scene, there is a trendy young adult community.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all else because of the content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit into Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
One of the top artists this year is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop, rap and soul.
Kallio says Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he'll be seen on tour in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggie's latest record is damn good, and he's done some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs were hidden in flower pots in Thailand 's tourist paradise . The tourists fled in terror .
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night local time.
The attack killed at least one local woman and injured more than 20.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bomb was planted on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
The blasts occurred as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who lives in Asia, tweeted a picture that spoke volumes about the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet properly, you can look it up here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People came running to me and said that a bomb had gone off outside the bar.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thanh.
At least one died.
The number of casualties is not yet known.
Soon afterward, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which is also popular with Finns.
As far as we know, no one died.
At the same time, another double bombing took place in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
And there was a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet detonated.
Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are dissatisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that there may also be criminal organizations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently been caught up in the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
This section of the newly formed reserve forces will go into battle first in a war situation .
In an acute war situation, the soldiers are ordered to combat duties only several months after taking the oath of allegiance, reports Central Finnish.
For example, according to the Defense Forces' training officer, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are fit to fight in the military service for 5.5 months.
According to the training commander, the first to be assigned are the reservists in the readiness forces.
No Marine or reservist is ordered to a mission without the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin training servicemen for immediate readiness units starting next year.
The units may be used in combat operations as required during the course of their training.
Pamela Tola got a huge settlement for the homeless .
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a bitter dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of the two-storey detached house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, causing a health-threatening microbial growth.
The couple had to sell the apartment as a scrap in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss for Tola and Waroma of up to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court, where they demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the plaintiff's court and the court of the court.
The court of appeals ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the couple's proceedings and settlement, totalling EUR 47 344.
The Court moderated the price reduction slightly because the buyers had already known at the time of the sale that some of the apartment was in need of repair.
However, the Court found that the defects were substantially more serious than had been alleged.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was in good repair and in good condition and that the details mentioned in the inspection report were not a problem.
The inspection report cited as risks and disadvantages ventilation and the inadequate management of rain and meltwater runoff along the cliff face.
However, the discussions did not reveal any urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that perhaps within a few years the rainwater from the rock would need to be controlled a little.
The transactions were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than previously thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which witnesses said was caused by both the rainwater from the rock and the capillary soil.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that air contaminated with microbes could also enter the interior through the porch.
The health risk-positive excess levels of yeast or yeast were found in the household cleaning room, basement stairwell, living room window drawer and basement laundry room.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The Court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the house had been altered without permission before the sale.
The terraces, for example, had been built, although the proper permits were not yet available.
But the gay issues were the heart of the courtroom.
According to the Court, the purchasers could have assumed, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living in and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
In the case of Tola and Waroma, the Court of First Instance did not consider that there was any particular reason for carrying out the usual wider inspection.
The buyers have not breached their duty to dispense, the court finds in its judgment.
Scary archive find: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - Finnish women also in the register
In a recent article in Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes that the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed documents of a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns, and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi masons.
The documents and registration cards are from the racial bureau that operated in Nazi Germany.
The Racial Bureau operated under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more so for women who were expected to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women were given gynecological tests to find out.
The Bureau of Race Research investigated the women's backgrounds, including church records.
The idea was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also required to be willing to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to provide the race bureau with handwritten biographies and good references from relatives.
The race bureau wanted to guarantee that the women were "child-loving", "saving", and "good National Socialists" who spoke German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either within or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, reports the website of the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidies to help people have children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" were forbidden by law, the museum's website states.
The sixth of the Traitor-Sire, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first day's sail for the Finns at the Rio Olympics, but was left as the tail end of the whole group in the second day's sail.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
The Wind Cheater Siren fought off the RS-X class of the day, 17th and 3rd.
In the overall standings, Cheating Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening race of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are 19th.
The Satulinna of Jari Bridge was recorded in a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so in a coma"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite artists in Finland for over 20 years.
From cruise ship bartender to 1995 tango king, Finland's best-selling solo artist and star of dance clubs and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to thrive and is currently on a wild rise.
The book about the life of the favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Naked, written by Mari Koppinen, was published today, Thursday.
In this book, Bridgehead tells the story of his life and career, for better or worse.
His career took a total upswing when he won the crown of the King of the Tango at the Seinäjoen Tango Market in 1995.
At the competition, Bridgehead sang tangos, but he had already planned a slightly different kind of music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for the bridge at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in the history of Finnish music.
The book says that the recording did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead recorded it in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so pissed!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately be thought to have been sung in a hunger-stroke.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't always have to be perfect and top notch.
The second incident related to his favorite songs, as described in the book, occurred nearly two decades later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with her then-partner and the case eventually ended up with the lyrics of the song "You Deserve Gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmä were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Bridgehead had imagined that he was making an album that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the break-up were not true, but it was based on a news story in the magazine 7 Days.
The newspaper story said that Jari's ex-lover had broken up with him because of his excessive partying and alcohol abuse, but Jari said that it was a complete and untrue lie.
Jari called the record company in anger about the book and refused to sing the song, but eventually did.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting to leave the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted to leave and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although opinion polls during the week of the vote predicted the opposite.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support for staying in the EU.
No reputable research institute or university supported the distinction, although a few individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign of the founder of Western politics, former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", was scrapped in the UK Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
From the economic slang
The Centre for Macroeconomics is conducting its latest monthly survey of the professional community's responses to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status by economists is that people don't understand economics.
Many people still believe that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, that is, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the realm of British.
Many people also feel that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it would promote export industries.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly irritated by the BBC's impartiality, which gave as much space to the few per cent of economists who supported the EU's separation as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in reporting the views of the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic giants on the consequences of the split.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, public debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were not given any consideration, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not feel they have a common interest.
While academics in big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, the message in small towns and rural areas was not effective.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming winning argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant clogs your hospital, an immigrant exploits you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
You can see immigrants in every health center waiting room.
How much easier would it be for a British to get medical care if there were none?
Every school has immigrant kids.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place at school if they were thrown out?
Every municipality has foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists failed to answer them, and if they did, their answers did not gain any visibility.
Economists have failed to explain why immigration is giving Britons more jobs, fewer health care bills, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU immigrants in particular - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen 's housing fund has been prepared for Brexit with cash .
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said that in Aberdeen, they prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan B, the pro-secession camp, was being prepared for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a tie.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have measurable liquid assets, but they may be needed now.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily, quoted real estate fund that the news touched on.
The old lady said the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open-ended real estate funds, Vanhanen says, of all the open-ended real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest cash in these funds was 10 percent or even below.
So the real estate funds prepared for Brexit with a very different strategy.
The funds closed trading
When the pro-secession camp won, Europe was in disarray.
However, the real estate market was relatively calm in the less than two weeks following the vote, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed everything.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, where he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they took the situation by storm and made headlines in the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared with 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowballs started to roll, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash it had accumulated, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close down the trade, but they changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worthwhile to panic-pull the money out.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation down, and most of them pulled the call.
Since then, the market has been fairly flat, and now the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks, says Old.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen's mainland European funds.
But there were a lot of inquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closures of real estate funds had received excessive attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK property.
The Aberdeen closure lasted six days, and the company sold off less than 10 of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it may hold onto its funds for the first half of 2017.
There is uncertainty at the moment and economic growth forecasts have been slashed, but the situation does not look 'worse' for Aberdeen.
The major questions now are about the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even opened up new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen notes.
The pound and dollar are at their weakest level in 30 years, and the market is down 15% on the pre-Brexit period.
A buyer of one dollar can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There's a lot of buyers willing, Old Man says.
Brexit has brought downside effects to London's housing market
At 2:00 a.m., things didn't look so bad.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investment at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's what you're thinking.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says the old man in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the dawn.
The news was broadcast on the normally silent television screens in the office, and the normally noisy crowd paused to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the showpieces were all red.
It was a morning I never thought I'd live, says the Old Man.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was mixed.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and so the situation was somewhat calm, Olden says.
The Brexit vote started a corrective movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Punta collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market was beginning to anticipate severe losses in the UK and particularly in London.
In London, office space was projected to suffer a 20% decline in the coming years.
Soon a number of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now the poison has subsided, but the air is still uncertain.
It is not, however, to be seen on the face of the old man who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He said it was too early to say much about what Brexit would bring.
So much remains to be seen: how the difference will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on developments in the London housing market has already been received.
The price data of CBRE, a real estate services company, cover about one third of the market.
They found that all London property prices fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the City of London, the number of office buildings affected by the mine rose by 6.1%, Olden lists.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly.
The monthly index was launched in 1987 and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the similarly large declines occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared rather quickly to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began with the U.S. housing market.
The old man feels that the comparison is not quite right, for now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The tunnel is another.
The real estate market has not seen the panic sales of that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
And the financing is normally available.
The repair move could have been coming anyway .
In fact, he is not surprised by the price adjustment movement - one that could have been in the offing without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other major cities around the world have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years now that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced, says Old Man.
So the fall started from a very high place.
London's prices have been climbing for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has London's population.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last property to go global, says Vanhanen.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutional and private investors are looking for real estate investment abroad.
London is known as a city, an easy target.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have led pension companies, for example, to seek revenue from new items.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhaas, the use of debt leverage is now much lower than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
♪ Spread it out, spread it out ♪
In London, prices have been flat last summer, Old Man tells us.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten its holdings in London, and last year it was a net seller.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says the old man.
He is afraid to say much, but he says there is little prospect of a rise.
The mood indicates that there is a downward or even motion ahead.
The old man has already seen several ups and downs, having been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that work is the way out.
If you're prepared to take risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you've diversified, you've diversified your risks, says the Old Man.
S-Group starts recording purchases more accurately than before
Soon, S-Group will know what you're eating, because the retail group said today that they're starting to collect more accurate data on their regular customers' purchases.
By the end of May, once the final amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will also start to collect it from the products purchased.
Group S is following Kesko in this respect, as the data on goods purchased with the plus card have been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes under licence.
The most effective channel is e-mail.
"Very few customers have refused to use product information", Riitala told Economist.
According to him, Kesko has no intention of reacting to the change in the registration of Group S.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into 10 groups based on the mere purchase of food.
The ranking is updated monthly.
The classification of the customers is also based on the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
The data on purchases at the point of production are collected only from the K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a permanent customer programme and no such programme is currently planned.
Finnish retailers have their own Single Bonus customer programme, which can be accessed at the Votilatalo, Sivo and Euromarkete.
We do not currently collect data at product or product group level, we will stick to the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and the day and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not reached the level of the K-group or the S-group, says Anu Ora, commercial director.
He said that the fixed customer programme was to be revised in the future, but that the Commission would give further details.
However, Ora does not promise that the registration of product information will be initiated.
First, the experiment.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data included occupation, education, residence, years of birth of children and previous personal data.
The persons belonging to the same economic activity and their roles are also registered.
The S-Card purchase records the date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of the purchase and the method of payment.
In addition, the S-bonus partners have received information from their cash registers.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismo, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, the data are recorded at the level of the product group for the time being.
The customers have long been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of customer ownership and partnering at SOK.
S-Group says they'll notify their clients of the change.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is stored in the registers, whether you want it or not.
The applicant may check the information stored on the S Group website.
For example, the cash registers cannot access the data, emphasizes Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is the newest dog to be confirmed by Tull - puppy will be the first explosion dog
The black Labrador cub is eagerly sniffing at five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It doesn't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila by playing with his favorite toy.
A can of gunpowder-scented shells was found in the drawer next to which Heila was sitting.
The powder gas is the first smell that Heila has been trained on, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and reasons for access to online shopping
Heila is the first dog trained by Tull to search for weapons and explosives and will be stationed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may take Heila and Sunto to other border crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks prompted action at customs and the monitoring has been strengthened since the attacks, says Mikko Grönberg, the customs chief inspector.
Another way to train a gun and explosives dog for customs duties is through the postal consignments that pass through Helsinki Airport.
The airport is also home to a number of international airports, including the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, the airport of Frankfurt am Main, and the airport of Frankfurt am Main.
In recent years, customs has made a finding at Helsinki Airport involving some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials, among online purchases, passenger luggage and air cargo.
Heila will be working at different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be checking all registered baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great use in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether further training of gun and explosive dogs will be provided in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School With a Church Name
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tully Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also trains with Heila with police and Defense Forces experts.
The police have extensive experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have extensive experience in explosives.
Customs, in conjunction with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always given further training as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have six drug dogs from Tull and a money and drug dog, Massi.
Labrador Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog to call at the airport include agility and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, since the dog is exposed to weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's house, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing gets home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Heila's getting subtle orders from the double-dealer.
The cameraman of the Evening News loses the camera's mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-like cover at the "turn" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's graduating from elementary school next year.
There are still a number of tests to be carried out in October to assess whether the training is adequate for the demanding job.
Heila can be seen on duty at Helsinki Airport in the second half of next year, if all goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to pet a dog in a work vest, Suntio reminds us.
The cost to customs of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
They are active for about seven or eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work periods last only from ten minutes to a few hours.
There's a lot of competition for working dogs in Customs.
Heila's been applying for the job of a customs officer.
Luckily for Suntie, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties at Tull.
The mini-state won its first Olympic medal . The people get a day off .
With a population of less than a million, Fiji's Olympic rugby is so highly regarded that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the case after the championship was settled.
The day after the team's homecoming, the day off.
The hero team is also being celebrated in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the final in the capital Suva, where a screen was installed in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish actor fainted after a gruesome performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard-fought fight at 175 kg.
The tocola has a special and lethal lifting property.
During or immediately after the heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 pounds from pushing and 145 pounds from grabbing.
His combined score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his job with his last 175 kilos, as well as his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose to the tune of a wild roar.
His body was shaking under the weight of the gun, until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish swimmer was happy to know that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired the Estonian striker Prosa from the Vetting League.
The Rovaniemi Football Association, a football club playing in the men's football league, has signed a contract with the Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with a lot of potential and a very small chance of coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over 10 players' agents.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, joins RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjoen, where the rovani meets the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's painting king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star is back in the spotlight: the teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, known as the "gentle Alex Dunphy" of the "Modern Family" sitcom, is once again showing off her formidable body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only revealed the actor's legs, but also his ass.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be considerably bolder.
The star has posed in pictures posted on social media in very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing extremely tight suits.
Winter, now on the verge of adulthood, has also recently published several photos of herself celebrating.
If you can't see it, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At this point, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on television for most of her life, and she grew up with the Kardashians.
He's learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was only 11.
The actor has upset some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where he'll be in ten years, with the recession already so bad, says one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, however, defend the actress and urge her to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You're an inspiration to many women, a radiant young woman.
Japanese prefer Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the windmill: in autumn it is possible to see the fairy-tale mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract Japanese tourists to start their excursions from the very beginning, says Visit Finland in a press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese tourism.
The lights of Revon are the hallmarks of our winter travels, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and the snowy landscape.
There is a great demand for winter trips to Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of trips in the autumn.
Few people know that the spring flowering season begins in early autumn and continues into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the edges, making the view twice as bright, says Anne Lind, marketing manager for Visit Finland.
Visit Finland's revitalization campaign is aimed primarily at wealthy, urban Japanese women aged 25-35, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
The tourist attraction in Finland is, among other things, through online advertising.
A survey carried out by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo shows that Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need more clear-cut, unique sights from Finland, and this is a region with huge potential, according to Lind.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much time in Finland as they did in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for tourism in Finland, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for silver in rugby, leading the FID championship to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed in Fiji's final challenge in Thursday night's final, when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji set a world record in the hammer, javelin, shot put, backstroke, sprint and breaststroke, winning their first Olympic gold.
With the loss came reasonable comfort from the silver medal - Britain's third of the day - and pride in their hard work in the inaugural Olympic rugby tournament, which saw them beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier in the day, a strong 7-5 victory over South Africa in the semi-final could have hampered their run to the final.
But despite this, in his condition, Fidi could have beaten a top-class team of 15 men.
Britain may - but probably will not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: FIDE's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England boss at Wimbledon.
The trip to Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
They only lost one here.
This back pain is painful, but the progress is staggering.
Fidi made a great start by rejecting the British blockade for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like chasing a moving bus, and the World Champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner to the goal.
With four minutes to go, Jerry Twain's second touchdown on the right field led to a field goal.
12-0 and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant punch stopped the man-mounted Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it was just a slowdown for Fid.
At the seventh minute, Jasa Bloodsucker scored in the right corner, and Great Britain was down 17 to 0.
Nakarawa scored again from the fresh start, and the clock was still more than a minute away... from the first half.
Then Vatemo Ravouvou leapt through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal, the score was 29-0 at halftime.
It looked as if Fidi had been born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's the way it is.
Great Britain made a series of changes at half-time that closed Fide's gap... for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fide's impressive innings.
Dan Norton scored for Great Britain with a touchdown in the left corner, narrowing the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the auditorium.
It was hard not to admire Fide's cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute goal was a frosting on Fid's cake that didn't need frosting.
The whistle was blown, the Fidies embraced, and Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Great Britain had beaten South Africa in a tight semi-final, with both scoring a goal - the British goal-kick to decide the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with a dazzling footwork and scored under the goal posts in the second half.
A great late punch from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the England 15-a-side rugby team, secured the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer led to a landslide victory for Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.
There's not gonna be a more emotional game in this world than gold, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard drives to the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, there were three voices on the boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams present throughout as the pair challenged for their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles event - the first women in British sports history to achieve such a feat.
Their reign was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also a record.
What we see, two great athletes, on the surface, joining with the sweetness of a swan, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
And behind every hour of the show is a group of helpful handlers who are gradually advancing the things that matter, and none of the handlers have been as important as the coach who, 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was a mess.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it's gonna spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were fortunate to be able to start their treatment in the off-season at the beginning of 2014, causing as little disruption as possible - if that's the term that can ever be used in situations like this.
I needed to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
The war itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thing that came to mind for the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning and had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, a veteran captain of the Royal Artillery regiment commanding Afghanistan, said: "I've been feeling a bit emotional this week, which may be a little over-reaction, but this means so much to me".
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin, too, have been working.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he deserves a lot of credit, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The couple set a rough rhythm that their competitors couldn't reach.
Even in the final 500 meters, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen was yelling, "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We got off to a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good fight and winning the race, and that's what we did.
Wait a couple of years before deciding what to do with his future.
Glover is attending the wedding next month, when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on him.
After London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better, she said.
Iceland replaces government overthrown by Panama leaks
Iceland is holding early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters angered by the Panama leaks have been demanding since the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers exposed tax evasion by several Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The date for the elections has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the public's recent anger will affect the outcome of the fall election.
In June, the presidential elections were marked by criticism of the ruling party, and an out-of-politics candidate, Gudni Johannesson, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic about Obama being the founder of ISIS.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest major speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in suggesting that incumbent President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the creation of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
"No one should ever be allowed to be commander in chief of the military who can sink to that level", Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the popular Muslim burkini swimsuit from swimming along beaches, reports Britain's Guardian newspaper.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have good manners and a secular swimsuit.
The decision also says that swimsuits that exaggerate religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two extremist groups linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest in his 80's.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu area was higher than the blue-water bathing water in the town of Tyykösjärv
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the blue-green algae has been observed on the shores of Lake Pyykös.
The Oulu Regional Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Regional Area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in the bathing waters of all beaches, with the exception of the beaches of the sea, were below the limits of the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in the seafood bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green deposition observed on the swimming beach of Lake Tyko does not yet render the water unfit for swimming, but under favorable conditions it can quickly turn into a blue-green flowering, with the surface of the water forming a blue-green mass in slabs.
The Environmental Action will monitor the situation with an intensified inspection.
If the bluebell population changes to a bluebell flower, this shall also be indicated separately on the information board of the swimming pool.
Check the results of the swimming pool samples here.
The R&D&I's Hakkaryan forestry reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest grant reduction is one of the tax changes in the Treasury's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the succession of the forestry estate.
The Ministry of Finance proposes four objectives for the reduction of forest yields: to promote the generation change of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest cover and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would deduct the net capital outcome of forestry.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote the generation change of forest land is good, said Juha Hakkarainen, forest director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
But the hackers will find something to criticize about the tax reform proposal.
The forestry contribution is calculated as the net capital gain of the forest owner.
It is the capital gains minus all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarinen, the impact of the tax reduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the income from the sale of the wood.
VM's proposal assumes that by deducting the net capital income of forestry, it is avoided that this would result in a loss of capital income of forestry which would be deducted in other taxation.
A person like that would get a tax break even if he didn't sell the wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complex.
The average forest owner is unable to grasp it, says the Hacker.
He also said that the model only affects a small percentage of forest owners.
The threshold for the tax deduction linked to the value of the forest yield is EUR 40 000.
The Hacker thinks it's been pulled too high.
As such, he says, it cuts 82 percent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction circle.
The model would affect about 10 percent of the forest ownership, he says.
The WM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of breeding in the order.
In forestry policy, the decline in forest yields has been delayed for decades, according to Hakkarinen.
The reason for this is the ageing of forest ownership.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful earthquake has caught the motorists in Himanga . Two cars have slipped into a ditch and collided .
A strange back-and-forth happened on the Himanga River on Friday afternoon.
According to the emergency department, two cars in a row crashed into a ditch, after which the one behind hit the one ahead.
According to the fire chief, Harry Puyhty, the crash was believed to have been caused by a powerful earthquake.
The rear-end car had two people inside, both of whom were taken to hospital for treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car in front was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers to Kalai.
A Finnish study may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku may help to develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the severity of the tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and the cells of the tissue grow normally in this environment.
Ivaska said that the cancer could be stopped from growing in the laboratory by restoring the surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue, in addition to cancer cells.
The findings are published in the August 4 issue of the respected journal of cell biology, Nature Communications.
The trial of the Muho family murder continues in the courtroom, the prosecutor demands the death sentence of the second perpetrator
The trial of the Muxo family homicide continues at court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family pet in Muhoks.
The other was sentenced to eight years and four months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The other is serving a 12-year sentence for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The convicted killer was also convicted of serious road safety offences as a juvenile and of operating a vehicle while a juvenile.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who had received the harsher sentence.
The prosecution is demanding a reduced sentence for a man convicted of murder as a juvenile to 12 years in prison.
They were in complete understanding at the time of the making.
According to the district court, 17-year-old teenagers killed a man who worked as a supervisor for the school's child welfare unit last July.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder, according to the plea agreement, attacked the supervisor sitting on the back of the living room sofa.
The director had gotten out of hand and had dragged the young man into his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum tube.
The director was also strangled with a wire, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
The psychiatric examination revealed that both of the convicts were in full consciousness at the time of the crime.
According to the court, the youths had been planning to flee the family home since at least the day before.
The world's longest-living vertebrate, the great white shark, only breeds at 156 years of age
A study published in the journal Science confirms that the ice shark is the world's longest living vertebrate.
In the North Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The ice shark's life span is increased by only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive the ice shark.
The scientists were able to determine the age of the stone by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residue.
From these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the jump to one side or the other can be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump as the economic wise man
Donald Trump's America does not need to change the world.
As much as a third of all federal tax revenue would be lost if the corporate tax reform pushed by Donald Trump were implemented.
Tax revenue would also fall, particularly with tax breaks benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he unveiled it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would be cut from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without it, we would be missing a very large sum of money, a billion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after the cut Trump proposed, 33.
The estate tax would be waived.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating business and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in the past must be re-imposed and the energy regulations must be abolished.
The health care reforms of Barack Obama must be reviewed.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the Evaluation of Operational Programmes (EAFRD).
Trump says "destructive" trade policies are the biggest cause of America's problems.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
The Commission has also proposed a new tax on imports from China, which would be 45 per cent and Mexico 35 per cent.
We offer you a new future.
"Americanism, not globalism, is our religion", Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect the cities, American ships will patrol the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to his custom, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by his aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program as leading the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released her own show early Friday, Finnish time.
The storm of the past - People's News
The sea is turbulent and deadly, but the actual storm is striking the streets of Madrid. A reckoning with the past can begin.
That sums up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, Travellers (2013), was a short-lived and satirical comedy, preceded by Skin in which I live (2011), the Spanish writer's career highlights.
In terms of level, Julieta (2016) falls somewhere in between those two works.
It is a conventional, seedy drama of love, relationships, and family, centered on the relationship between a mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is often seen as a long back story.
Life seems to be working out for a middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe until the last few minutes of the film.
In a backward and long letter, Juliet recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts with the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
The second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher in the TV series Time Between the Dustbines (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been dealt with in a way that may be considered a mess, but I would say time has been deliberately and literally wiped away.
From the often-singularity of Almodóvar's films to the humor of Juliet, there is a fair distance.
It is a well-acted, restrained, somewhat musical, rather melancholy film with elements of elegia.
Instead, the visual colourfulness typical of the Spanish director is retained, and so it begins to quietly strike the eye more as a pure piece of fashion than as a dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are plagued by illness, death, or other sudden losses, but the surface remains the same.
This is especially true of dress: in the case of a character, the dress changes from scene to scene, and so do the revealing earrings.
Almodóvar is precise on these matters, but the main point, the tuning of each scene, is not much improved.
When it's mechanically replicated, it's a little bit of a superficial and a little bit of a soulless effect.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three novels by Canadian author Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The novels have been published in the book Running: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filming.
The material would have been unmatched in emotionally intense drama, the larger the issues - especially the scandalous guilt - the film's themes address.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The main cast is Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti, and the other three are from the same film.
The premiere is August 12th.
The government is trying to hold elections .
The new cuts will not be made, the ministers are saying, so that the Finnish people do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts completed in the spring are made on the crude market.
There will be no more surgeries.
The four billion already decided on is enough.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to the Member States.
This is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as the social security cuts were decided on in the spring framework.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to national pension indices will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
The training cuts are continuing.
The town halls are haunting
Why do the ministers so tirelessly insist that these are the ones who will not be subjected to further surgery?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important heat meter of the election season, not the ballot box.
We have seen in the past that the result of municipal elections leading to a divergence of the parties in government spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup, however, says that the ruling party, the Finns, expects a landslide defeat, even though its result in the previous elections was a modest 12.3% compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns won 752 new deputies, many of whom will face the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life of a government of three parties of roughly the same size depends on the strength of the Finnish fundamentalists.
This has not lasted, and more than half of the party voters had had enough of government policy within the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's activities have also emerged.
The rhetoric of 'no new cuts' is, firstly, a cover-up of the fact that next year they will be made in a drastic way and, secondly, an attempt to soften the blow that awaits the Finnish people.
The major operations in 2018?
In a year, if the Owl government is still in power, it's probably not going to be the same.
The government has set itself the objective of reducing indebtedness in this election period, but the budget proposal by Petteri Orpo will add EUR 5.9 billion to the debt next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise their hands in the middle of the election season and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: the debt has not been reduced or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means that the previous ones will be cut even more heavily in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the spring, in the parliamentary elections, whatever happens will be accepted.
These measures did not reduce the debt
It is quite clear that the current measures are not helping to bring about a debt crisis, despite the efforts of the White Eagle to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by the Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen at the budgetary briefing prove this in no uncertain terms:
The forecasts for global growth have repeatedly proved to be academic, meaning that there is no attraction from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the 2008 crash, except temporarily during the early 2010s recovery.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade, from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more per year than in 2008.
The curve presented by the previous report shows that the general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% by the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief submitted by the Left Alliance was rejected as irresponsible.
The cost of maintaining unemployment next year is about six billion euros, which will be covered virtually entirely by taking on new debt.
This is the concept of the centre, the association and the Finnish people of what is responsible.
Question: The Commission wants to leave a lot of work to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of daycare, youth work and exercise for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - the National Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
The clear majority of the population also assigns responsibility for libraries, culture, public schools, building supervision, secondary education and waste management to a single municipality.
The responsibility of the countryside, on the other hand, is most clearly intended for the county, special care, vocational training, vocational colleges and institutional care for the disabled.
No part of the municipal responsibility for the organisation of the work is to be transferred to the State.
A drunk driver underage ran after police and escaped.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove off a police patrol on the Ilomantsin Road at 1:30 a.m. on Friday.
A patrol of police tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man went off to drive the police away at a reasonable speed.
The rear end continued to Sonkajan Beach, then on to Sorronahonti and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but a faster-paced policeman caught up with him.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per millilitres.
He also did not have a driver's license to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the quarry fell into the ditch.
The truck, which was carrying the stone, fell into a ditch at the Kneef Lake in Kavinti on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had gone off the road, curving to the left, and had fallen into a ditch on its side.
The rescue team lifted the injured driver from the fallen truck through a door overhead, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
The truck that fell spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which the rescue team sucked into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon at the Air River .
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkyla, southern Bavaria.
Police are looking for a woman about 5'6", thin, well-groomed, with white hair that extends below the chin.
For any sightings or clues to any missing persons, please call the Nordic Situation Centre on the hotline 0295440513.
The materials of the accident in the air . See the photo gallery of the Parafest disaster .
The floodwaters that swept over the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially viable and that the event can be held next year.
The last Parafest performer Kalle Salonen performed at the end of the night on Friday at the market square.
On Saturday, the program continues with performances at the Municipal Theater, beginning at 1 p.m.
The art center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 1 1 5 p.m.
The program will be organized as planned.
The downflow occurs in a cloud of clouds when rainwater and its weight trigger a downflow of air.
Changes in the shape of the water in the cloud bind heat, thus cooling the descending air and accelerating its velocity toward the ground.
According to the Meteorological Institute, there are several flash flows in Finland during the summer.
The path of the tidal currents is difficult to predict.
The current hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the site of the Parafest, just before 5 p.m. on Friday.
Three tents collapsed, with about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, he injured four people, all of them slightly.
One of the children was taken to the hospital with minor injuries.
Air pollution is aging Londoners
A study has shown that Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British investigation is being reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare company Caci is analyzing the most toxic particles in the air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, say, their peers living in rural areas.
The skin-aging particles are a very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that early ageing is a risk especially for Londoners who commute by foot near busy streets.
Londoners may try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing a variety of masks, but a more practical solution is to clean the skin regularly.
The tractor brakes failed to push the man in front of you .
He had moved rocks in his yard on a tractor.
As he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor spilled on him.
The man did not fall, but the tractor managed to push him enough that he was taken to Central Hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor could not dig any farther, as it hit the rocks in front.
A new lease of life for the coming season
The Riese River Liiga-Riento, which plays in the Volleyball Champions League, will start the series in October from a better starting point than men's memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The common thread is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the series' beginnings have been bleak for Rienn.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as Riennos head coach, praises the new team for being enterprising and united.
The third-seeded center, Fred Musoni, is entering his second season in Rienna.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 6'7" point guard.
Garchet is a passenger, the Brazilian is 6'5".
Through Josba, Kataja and the Joki Boys, to the U.S. national team.
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Cup since 2003.
Now in Tampere, the sixth race is underway, only missing out on 2013 when Canada was better in the North American races.
I was working in the market, playing with the local ladies, when I noticed the ad.
The U.S. was about to form a national team for the Salibandi.
I got interested, and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen went to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such thing as a "sally band" at the SM level.
They played the game at the university.
I played basketball at Kataja and later hockey at Joki Boys in the SM-liiga, Jumppenen remembers.
Jumppanen played for the university in the saliband SM-series in the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
And while he was playing, he was coaching the A-girls to the state championship.
The women's SM-series career peaked with silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series through 10 matches, with a balance of 169 matches, 51 + 34 = 85.
The last season of the SM is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
The Jönsulan salibandyseura Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and the Enolan-born Tatu Väänänen was selected for the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In the Helsinki League, 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's matches, where he has accumulated a total of 9 + 4 = 13.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a knee injury and is a regular member of the national team with 117 international matches.
The national team was also named after the winner of the Seinäjoen Pelivelveljetten, Mika Kohonen, who was seen in Finland's shirt for the last time at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy team is Petri Kettunen from Konti.
Beach volleyball star Essi Hasu closes the circle at Kouvola - SM gold missing from the trophy case
Essi Hasu is about to retire from beach volleyball, at least temporarily, after this season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be decided this weekend at the Kouvola Sports Park.
During the three days, the medal matches will be played in both the adult and junior categories.
The final tournament, organised by the Kouvola Volleyball Players' Association and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, will be contested by the top six teams in each ranking.
The local colour is represented by Essi Hasu, a native of Elimäen NMKY, who has been one of the top beach volleyball players in Finland for several years.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, looks forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible can get to the viewing room by the weekend.
I'm sure the ballpark is getting a great arena.
I haven't played in the adult series in Kouvola very often, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu is feeling.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's passion for sports and provided a good food for a fine hobby.
I have many memories of my childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine, playing for the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
The main thing is to think about the oversized jersey, the knee pads that roll around the ankles and the high-pitched ace cries and choreography after the score, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The group spirit created an environment where it was comfortable to play.
All of our families were heavily involved - the father of a teammate coached us, and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural counterweight to indoor ball as a junior.
The curved pool has been playing music since the 1990s.
The current activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior World Championships myself, thinking that one day I would be there playing.
Now this dream is coming true when Hasu plays this weekend with the beatnik Anniina Parkis in the SM finals.
The goal of the second-seeded pair in the tournament after Riik Lehtosen and Taru Lahti is clear.
The realistic goal is a medal.
We're still missing the SM gold from the prize box, and Hasu is throwing it mysteriously.
This weekend's performance at Kouvola may be the last time Hassu will be seen by an audience he knows.
At the beginning of September, we will face new challenges in the civil service.
I mean, I'm sure the international career is over after the Tournament of the Cattle.
Otherwise, the guardrails will be put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.
The current of the flood knocked down the tents at the event of the disabled in Joensuu, a great disaster was near
A flood washed down three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to hospital for further treatment.
According to the farmer, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the larger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened at 5:00 p.m. on Friday.
The fire chief Markus Viitaniemi, a daytime friend of the Karyalian who interviewed him, told the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
The paper says the rest of the story is at stake.

Solomon Koli Bravely Started a Farming Business
Agricultural entrepreneurship means taking risks, sweat and perseverance.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future for the countryside.
Just two years ago, together with his younger brother, Valtteri Kolli, he started the business as a continuation of their farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers from his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking on debt and increasing the order so that bread could be obtained from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything on the line.
If you're going to start something, I think you should do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard raft, and at first, the bank was not too keen.
However, I was very brave in my own way and I have been fully involved in the project, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not believe in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out for the better.
Salomon Kol, a meat-car farmer, is planning to invest in an even bigger shell.
The work has paid off, with Solomon's College being named one of the ten best in the Rural Future magazine's young food producer competition.
Right now, he's competing for a chance to win.
He can vote for the paper on its website until August 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive figure of 0,2 % was reported.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not made any comments on the comments of the interested parties.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
The Commission notes that the Commission's analysis of the situation in the Union during the review investigation period shows that the Commission's analysis of the situation in the Union during the review investigation period was not adequate.
Compared to the previous month, the following consumer goods prices increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7 %), transport (1,8 %), leisure and culture (6,3 %), restaurants and hotels (1,2 %), mixed goods and services (0,3 %).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine services (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as in the previous month.
Snapchat's "anime" factory is being criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says anime has served as inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its roughly 150 million daily users to modify reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, or a dog, or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, facial-deforming tools that produce over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any misdirected steps quickly end up in public records.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for allegedly promoting blackface masks or favouring lighter skin as a beauty trait.
So when Snapchat this week advertised a lens for some users that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and crooked cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people -- keltanaam or yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring controversies might be a sign of a bigger problem in the company with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company explained that the lens was meant to honor anime characters, not caricatures of Asians.
But for observers with experience in racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently opposed the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "offensive and uncomfortable to say the least".
He added that it was difficult to argue against the comparison, which has the crude Asian cartoon and the filter enhancements side by side.
It shows that the filter is not just yellow, but yellow when taken to extreme depletion.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's breaking through these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in a never-ending struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood to the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge, racially diverse youth audience may mean that they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image, it's much harder for "they" to go unnoticed than it used to be.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a letter to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that the race-related disputes reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, so they can make decisions like this", said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have people of different skin colors at work, but they're not in a position where they feel safe or can speak directly".
Other observers share his view, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its workforce, pointing to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company hired a recruiter some time ago to focus on underrepresented populations and to advance internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he is keeping his Snapchat account closed, adding: Is it true that they actually need more users like us to be able to say this is not OK
A congressional panel has ruled that military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence.
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials at the U.S. military's war zone headquarters had edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what was happening on the ground.
The annual case report of the subcommittee set up by the Republican chairman of the House Defense Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at headquarters who said that senior officials were tampering with their assessments of the American effort to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Operations Area in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence findings approved by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than the facts on the ground warranted, and were consistently more positive than the analysis produced by other elements of the intelligence community", the report's press release said.
"The events at Centcom are unacceptable... our warfighters are suffering when poor analysis is presented to high-level decision-makers", said Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif.
The failures of Centcom's leadership reach right to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems in the Headquarters' descriptions and analysis of the US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior administration officials in the Obama administration ordered the reports to be tampered with, it does describe how analysts felt as if Centcom leaders pressured them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press releases, statements and congressional testimony were significantly more positive than the events themselves", the report said.
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has also been involved in the operation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear", said Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence officers at the U.S. military's War Zone headquarters manipulated the headquarters' intelligence output to minimize the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by broader findings as the investigation continues.
The Inspector General of the Department of Defense has opened an additional, ongoing investigation into the Centcom intelligence.
The House Intelligence Committee's Democrats released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with the conclusions of some Republican task forces.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a futile isolated process for intelligence evaluation of ISIS and Iraqi security forces", said Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the committee's Democratic chairman, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process 'delayed the publication of intelligence products', 'weakened the mood among analysts' and 'did not allow enough room for different perspectives'.
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts into adjusting their conclusions to a "setting or political narrative".
The Daily Beast reports Tuesday the preliminary findings of a congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had opened an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that 'experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues'.
The study has implications other than just whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (as a growing number of defence officials now claim).
Last year's indictment questioned how much President Obama can trust the headquarters to provide honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a decade-long controversy when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of many analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker was also a key player in the insurgency over the Islamic State's intelligence.
According to officials, last year Hooker's group concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes on Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy, as it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters, however.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers viewed his testimony to the Senate as an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth straight women's field hockey tournament by hosting a semi-final with Great Britain.
The day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday in a 3-0 win over India.
Five goals in two games may sound like a memorable feat, but Bam, 27, said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same before.
"I have no idea", he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings.
But he knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Great Britain, who were still unbeaten after Thursday's 2-0 win over Japan.
Britain and the United States will face each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will decide who will place first and who will place second in their six-team group.
The first-placed team will avoid the strong Netherlands, the second-placed team, for a little longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
Regardless of how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have raised eyebrows with their surprise success here, four years after they finished last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at age 3 (his older twin brothers played at Drexel), joining the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
He was not selected for the 2008 Olympics because he did not make the final roster.
In 2012, nothing went right for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham of England was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the same workload in London as we do now.
We've made a complete reversal.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a close-range touchdown.
India had come into the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly strong and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took control.
He carried the ball long to the left of the field, then turned around the center and pulled the ball into the goal to lead the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth.
This draw was the first tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had conceded a goal in each of his first three victories.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good place now", Parnham said, "but it depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday".
The tranquility of the trampoline in the midst of the Olympic highlights
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are underway.
What is happening in Rio de Janeiro seems to be a continuous and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic flag itself were a flaming message sent from archer to swimmer and from gymnast to triathlete.
It is impossible to turn on the television, read the newspaper or listen to a conversation in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, an Olympic rookie and future heartthrob with a smile, could well be one of the most recognizable names in prime-time, supported by sponsorship deals and well-meaning TV ads - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for the Olympic gold medal in trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all the species equally.
Farther from the center, in partial shade, are the sports that are not universally accepted: air pistol, archery, volleyball, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I'd like to draw attention to the subdued charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolines have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, their presence has been so little noticed in the 16 years since then that many of those I interviewed did not realize that they were an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the men's medals, the Chinese and Canadians the women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals in London.
However, there is a certain understated charm to trampolines, in part because to the uneducated ear they sound more appropriate for clown school than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm no expert here. I'm just a fan of the flightless.
It has the potential for entertainment, as seen in the color of the endless cartoon booms, but it also has the affinity of gymnastics and swimming, two sports that are essentially combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning a jumping board.
The champions will jump from a giant trampoline to nearly 30 feet in height, performing a series of bouncing movements (turns, folds, and volts) before finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and time spent flying.
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
The medalists must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth across the field, in search of gold.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting line, but also, in the television news, another ridiculous frontier: the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it can even bring tears to the viewer.
But it's also the reason why watching the games can be a little tiring.
The trampoline will give you a rest from this.
The trampoline is heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor climbs to the new rise, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty involved, but there is no furious rush to the finish, no long jumps, just a dreamlike, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to a Zen state as you can get to the Olympics.
The women's qualifying and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon starting at 1 PM ET, with the men's race also on Saturday at 1 PM.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon programming beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic spirit, they provide a quiet, charming moment that is probably not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as male gymnasts in the United States suggested some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new, breathless fan base.
A generation showing its mind in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable states in Africa, a staunch ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Videos of the protests, believed to be from late last year or early this year, show security forces beating young people with sticks while forcing them to stand with their hands against a wall.
The UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.
'Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future', said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western nations value its stability.
The American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat the terrorist threat in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country is receiving as much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has been greatly improved, and the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Yet, while Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organizations have consistently spoken of government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissenters have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you stifle people and they have no choice but to show their opinion, this is what happens", said Seyoum Teshome, a university professor in central Ethiopia.
All the youth is showing their mind.
One generation will show its mind.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from the land use of the ruling coalition to the strangulation of power.
After last year's highly-criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now hold all the seats in Parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, where fighting along this tense and disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups like the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
After years of hiding, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, with the proliferation of cheaper smartphones and improved internet access.
Even if the government shut down Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via location-obfuscating web proxies.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for protests.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amhara, are getting along better.
The Oroms and Amhara are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amhara, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
"We are on the way to organizing under one umbrella", said the group's leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amhara and Swami think that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the Tigers, who make up about six percent of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, commerce, and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was especially adept at spotting early signs of discontent and using secret messengers to render opponents harmless.
"The current government does not have such a basic instinct", said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' shoes.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the tiger-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands of people voted in elections that analysts said appeared to be rigged and then looted by the government.
The ensuing violent attack killed many protesters, though fewer than in previous months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter railway, and for their remarkable progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government from within the country.
And now it's starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked tiger-owned businesses, and anti-tiger anger is becoming more prevalent on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a precarious position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for flights to neighboring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it was closing this base.
While the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the already unstable region to collapse.
"This", Abdi said, "is the real balance".
Donald Trump explains his Obama-founded Isis as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the controversy over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly tweeted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The discovery raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been scrambling to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position to explain remarks that he may not mean.
After the hint at the Wednesday night campaign rally, Trump made the same claim with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday interviews, where he implied that his intent was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a complete reversal of the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the allegation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his tone by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took it to his ear.
The latest storm of criticism comes as Trump has sought to refocus his campaign on the economy amid falling poll results.
Trump and Clinton fought over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject.
Returning to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after apparently facing widespread criticism for suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm being sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to make a political speech at the border and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans, he looks at how they work and then he explains one way or the other depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's very clever about his statements and knows that they're vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Instead of softening his tone for a large voting public, Trump has been more cavalier in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump is trailing Clinton by a significant margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally avoids apologizing for provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misinterpreting his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in a CNN interview Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in what he is saying", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton were creating an Islamic state.
And that's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a virtually unknown, a small organization that he called amateurs, completely wrong, and that's why this happened, because he pulled his troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans would argue that the Obama administration, with Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's Pennsylvania meetings, Trump continued his Twitter attack on the news media, which is ranting about his every word and is biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television experts who try to get him off, saying "They can't do it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as further evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a cheap, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have wireless, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the corner of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for him.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals bemoaned it as the latest loss in a mid-class city in the process of being rebuilt.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crumbling and Verb is now a soap shop".
But if New York is change, it's also reinventing.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same, and it's got the same unpretentious vibe.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001, and he was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance his new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso machine.
It even used the old Verb lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes a variety of cheese and chicken eggs, and capers and browned onions are included.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The coffee shop doesn't serve beer anymore, but they do make fresh juices.
In the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many of our former customers", he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and was a regular visitor to Verbe.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he would wander into the coffee shop.
He says that after Verbi closed down, he gave up coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verbi's coffee and culture", he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink, one of the new additions, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal visitor to Verbe since 2003.
He used to work there, always ordering the same thing.
"Every day at seven past fifteen, regularly like clockwork, I went in and they were making spicy bagel dough", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes he makes a variation of a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherry offered Verbe a special soap to use as an ingredient in their coffee, which was refrigerated.
"I think we can still take the offer", Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved of the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to display it somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
It's possible the cafe could expand into the next building.
For many customers, it's enough to get their old favorites at the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and he said he was upset when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home when he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I've been wanting to smell it", he said.
A Square Meal: The Paralyzing Food of the Summer
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt enjoyed the sophisticated cuisine of Fifth Avenue, such as the goose liver pastry, and the Maryland goose chard soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in a tomato sauce, potato soup, and plum chicken for dessert.
"It was a culinary gesture of solidarity with people who suffer", Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
There's a couple in Brooklyn Heights who are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told of life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper's on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some sort of culinary solidarity of their own, they meet the journalist at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpretentious lunch bar in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving of turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating during the night.
"The murals were very popular", Ziegelman said.
There was peanut butter, liver butter, beans butter.
They were made from a raw material and some cheap ingredient that was added to the actual raw material.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe was teasing.
"It must have felt like a load of lead in my stomach", he said.
In the years before the Depression, American tables, especially in rural areas, were like a "eat as much as you like" notebook.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and fresh pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation coped with the sudden loss of its status as a land of plenty.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes, such as crackers and boxes, became staples, and the box was "a powerful way to use food sources", Ziegelman said, because chefs could hide less appealing ingredients under a creamy sauce roll.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
For years, meat had been the centerpiece of American cuisine, but it had become a luxury product, rationed.
Special recipes were tried out where the calories and nutrients were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
In addition to researching the recipe book, Ziegelman prepared a meal of the era, which included roasted onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table", Coe said.
Ziegelman was right: "It was unreal".
Peanut butter is no good for fried onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Housing Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's diet more than ever before or since.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraging women to become "budget makers" and to take up the challenge of turning the messy pieces of matching spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly appealing are accounts of the government's response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" stance.
While publicly praising the simple, rural Iowa food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with garlic sauce", Coe said.
He was eating in the almost gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, not encouraged him to be an example from his own belly.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, the White House became a place that not only served some of the worst food in Washington, but also the worst food ever cooked.
Many of the Lamanite dietary practices were abandoned as soon as the land was back on its feet.
"The legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition", Ziegelman said, "and the way science is applied to cooking".
The couple said that in writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as her inability to throw food away.
"He was really afraid of wasting food", Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick".
There was a wind-up incident.
After the plates were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out the dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called the plum powder", Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a name that was visible.
There was no cream on the dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped their spoons into their sticky, brown list.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe's got one and two.
Sounds like a positive budget-maker, but he told his wife, "A little chopped german nuts might help".
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal fees in the hepatitis C patent battle against Merck.
The United States District Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover the legal costs it incurred in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. Inc.
In June Gilead was discharged from $200 million in penalties for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvon, following a U.S. judge's finding of Merck's misconduct involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to waive the damages it received in the case of the opposition.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can clearly cure over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over ownership of the laboratory work on which Gilead's active drug sofosbuvir is based.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken ISIS-controlled Manbij
US-backed forces have taken over the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the town after the last group of fighters hiding in the town left.
The troops had freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's ally, the Manbij military council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are starting to investigate it", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 percent of the federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse's income for that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released their 10-year tax returns.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting the benchmark for financial transparency", Clinton's campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false pretexts and reversing his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have invoked an audit by the IRS as a reason for refusing to release tax returns.
"Your turn", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his charitable giving, his business dealings, and numerous other ties, including to Russia.
Clinton has grappled with the problem in a video posted online Friday that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he brought up the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in decades: publish his tax returns", he told the audience.
Politico has reported that Trump has paid no or very little tax in two of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants as saying that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, that would ensure that those earning more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also in the middle of an audit by the IRS, and that Trump isn't afraid of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns since 2007.
The actual federal tax rate for the Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from their salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index-linked mutual fund, and the Clintons reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chilean condoms and electrical appliances help protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from migrating to human settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder at the animals.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago in conjunction with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its publicity by training volunteers in northern Tanzania villages to use the nonviolent four-step method to protect homes and hundreds without harming animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we've seen a shift in attitudes in these communities, where they're now much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming them", Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing at the invading elephant with a flashlight and blowing the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, you throw what's called a chili cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth and a lightbulb, and then the condom is closed so that only the ignition wire is visible.
When you light a condom, it explodes and sprays chili powder into the air.
One sniff is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last option is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli route number at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish heritage has resigned after a media storm revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli number, which the employee said was due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made a documentary about the Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann was trying to find a list of country codes provided by an Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from a hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote it.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through its own call centre.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up in the hotel lobby.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received there "shocked him".
The hotel receptionist said it was a deliberate decision by the Kempinski Hotel management.
The reason behind the decision caused the filmmaker even more shock.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the Israeli route number be removed", the employee is quoted as saying, according to Lanzmann.
The German ambassador to Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the case a "great injustice", reports the Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That is a great injustice in itself.
But even more shameful is that this is what happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We're waiting for the hotel to make the right decisions, the official said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply gave in to the alleged demands of the Arab customers.
"Shame", said another publication, noting that the hotel on the beautiful Kurfurstendamm Street is located near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges, calling the incident "negligence" and apologizing to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"The explicit order not to include Israel on the shortlist was never made", Kempinski's representative was quoted as saying, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
That adds up to the fact that the directional number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students demonstrating their minds
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to disperse the student crowd, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the protest to express their horror at the plans.
The governor of the state of São Paulo, Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, proposed that just under 100 public schools be closed and 300,000 students relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim president Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration came just days after protesters rallied in support of suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
RT business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases by 71 %
Since the lifting of sanctions, the volume of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year, says Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a high level of interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are continuing their existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade", Dzhagaryan said.
The Commission also noted that the Russian exporting producers have not been able to demonstrate that the measures are not in line with the Union interest.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian nationals, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 most visited countries in Russia for the first time.
"I think it's safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken", he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians are visiting Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
'I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have well-preserved monuments of the ancient Persian civilization,' he said.
Scottish rider Callum Skinner crashed into the finish line as the British captured the cycling gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner claimed his title in the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night as the three-man British team defended their 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish teammate Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the youngster as he scored the winning goal from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic medals.
And they repeated the feat after placing modestly sixth at the World Track Championships in London in March, although Hoy has since retired from racing.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoye's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man the British coaches held dear to see the potential in Scotland, which is now being realised.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoye four years ago, and Skinner, who set the Olympic time trial record, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the double for gold.
Hindes was just behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team to the front, and Skinner held on.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hinds driving at a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoy followed his position as an expert for the BBC, and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hinds as they stepped up the ladder.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: "The comparison is flattering".
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world championships.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After winning the 2012 London Marathon alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted his comments and no complaints have been made by British competitors.
This time, the overwhelming victory was not a problem.
Hindes said: 'It felt like being in London with so many British flags on the runway.
As a team, we've made a connection over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten cycling events in both Beijing and London.
If this is the trend of the last five months, we're looking at a successful five days in the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's performance, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoye's feat of winning three Olympic medals in one Olympics.
This would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have six gold medals and one silver.
It'd be like Hoyle.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
We'll win it with the guys.
Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the history of the four-horse, four-kilometer team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record holder, who won gold in London in 2012, is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will surely be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the deadline when the officials called him for a length measurement.
In the women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavi, set a world record by stopping the clock at 4:13:260.
Team Great Britain has learned to trust that its great cycling team will take the middle of the Olympics and win the whole set of medals.
After the truly exceptional and complete controls that were presented in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered ahead of the Rio Games.
There has been drama, not the least of which has been the departure of technical director Shane Sutton in April over sexism and harassment allegations, and the end of the racing career of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night of competition at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain's now legendary reputation rising to its peak at the perfect moment could once again hold true.
Portland's future of fusion in doubt because of the termination of the electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victoria aluminum smelter, along with hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain after the electricity company that supplies the plant with electricity revealed that one of the plant's owners is in the process of terminating the distribution contract, so all distribution contracts are expected to be cut.
The measure follows the decision by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the subsidies required to keep the plant in operation.
The 20 year fixed-term payment will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
Up to 2000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, if the factory is closed.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelting consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Portland Alcoan smelter is losing money and is under closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the plant's production price.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter at its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it was also waiting for the other three owners to conclude their contracts.
The majority of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, with smaller shares held by CITIC of China and Marubeni Corp of Japan.
AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity demand from the smelter will continue, it said.
The AGL also stated that the agreements were 'protection agreements' that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
'For this reason, AGL expects to generate a profit from the contracts in the financial year 2017', the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's earnings from the financial year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong prospects for the wholesale electricity futures market.
AGL said that it had already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in advance of the conclusion.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contracts 'does not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the smelter's electricity supply'.
The US company said that it had signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the industry.
Earlier this week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
The removal of both plants would represent a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
He said that for us as a power producer this would not be a good thing.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of Vogue in September.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mom-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, is on the cover of Vogue America's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and has modeled at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Watching this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the troubled Rob and Caitlyn, and including everyone's favorite entertainment style, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but ended up with a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It's a cliché plot line for almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV series (Seacrest says the lines "I guess you thought we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-switched puppy), but Kris had to get her other girls to somehow take advantage of this publicity.
That's because we've definitely moved into a new era of the Kardashians with September's Vogue.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the best-selling issue of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion estimated that 615 of last year's 832-page brochure contained advertising content).
The cover story is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more 'models' on the cover than 'models' who are 'models'.
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's induction.
But if Jenner, described by the magazine as the "success model" of her generation, happens to be the first in that category, she's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today's young people who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They're rightfully talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year's national model, Beyoncé, has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
In her reality TV history, Jenner's place in the fashion world will always be a shambles.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
This feeling was re-exposed on the cover of Jenner's Vogue.
But it's irrelevant to be dissatisfied.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you a cosmetic cream by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her kids, she's a reality TV star.
The Community's legal centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the legal centres of the Community each year as the sector prepares for the impact of additional cuts in funding for its already frontier activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunity to fight against unjust evictions and the like - are already turned away when they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services, which have already been extended to the Community's borders, are preparing for further cuts.
By June of next year, these legal centers are set to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland's community legal centers, said that thousands of people are already turned away each year, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres statistics.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
'Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are turned away from essential services every year', he said.
People who leave abusive relationships, who have unmanageable and crippling debts, families who are separated, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government is cutting funding by 30% in June 2017, which means thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders are forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandy of Queensland to immediately reverse these cuts so that people can get the help they need for their legal problems.
Last year, the Land government delivered on its pledge to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and its client communities, and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign is being sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened a worker with a gun in February while they were driving in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign programmer Vincent Bordin Wednesday in Charlotte state court.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that 'it was not going to happen'.
Captain Earl Phillip pulled out a pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap, Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the complaint said.
"You don't have to fire a gun to cause harm", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused outrage by telling a North Carolina audience that the "people of the Second Amendment" - which generally refers to gun owners and gun owners - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context and that he does not support violence.
The Borden suit is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent oversight and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional distress.
Trump Rep. Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
All attempts to reach Philip have failed.
WCCB, the local news affiliate in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consultancy, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division of the Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow is bringing revitalization and prosperity to the whole country, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was the attraction of the London 2012 Games, when we put a lot of effort into making sure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we're doing it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of trainers in the airport sector by a further EUR 10 million.
As in the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics, some people are coming to the conclusion that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be shamed in front of the world.
The suspicions were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have completed an infrastructure investment programme of £11 billion on time and within budget: from T5, voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years running, to T2, built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to build a third runway, supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be too.
It is time to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, companies that bypass ad-blocking programs are "a game of cat and mouse", said one of the companies that produce such programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their software filters to block ads again on social networking sites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it was changing the code around ads on its website to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's bypassed the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad blocking community and its perverts has been going on since ad blocking was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a powerful indication of how much sadness the industry has experienced over ad blockers.
According to a study by PageFair and Adobe last year, some 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, nearly four times the number who used them in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is pursuing ad blockers for desktop pages, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "ad-like" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to address the problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway, apparently suicide.
Victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway in the early hours of Thursday in what appears to be a suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed the "desperate act" of lying in the dark on the road, where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly attempting suicide, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have been identified, police said, urging them and all eyewitnesses to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in this situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was there any chance of avoiding the collision?
That's for the prosecution to decide, Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - both involving a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that motorists could not expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of charges of negligent homicide after he struck and killed a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police officer responding to the emergency call was driving in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was 'a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation', the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the hot, waterless surface and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere of Venus could have once been terrestrial.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation is due to its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have been spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had drier regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographic variation to support life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent dimmer sun.
"In the GISS model simulation, Venus' slow rotation exposes its daytime side to the sun for almost two months at a time", explained Anthony Del Genio, a GISS researcher, in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as a rain shade, shielding much of the surface from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the earth are actually a few degrees cooler than they are today.
The model produced a story of Venus's developmental stages similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely once habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with its deadly greenhouse gases - Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the publication Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his Avalanche coaching job .
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, citing a lack of leverage in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and mentioned that the team will begin the search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served my duty as the Colorado Avalanche's vice president of hockey operations and head coach with passion, enthusiasm and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I've been thinking a lot and a lot over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and the Vice President of Hockey Affairs must be fully aligned with the vision of the organisation.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not being met at present.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision", Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the league's Jack Adams Award winner for the best coach in his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Minnesota knocked Colorado out in the first round of the playoffs, and the team hasn't made the playoffs in the last two years.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a record of 39 wins, 39 losses, and 4 ties, and lost to the Wild by five points, missing out on the Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The strike for the salaries of North Sea oil workers will be postponed until all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the lead negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have been organised on an occasional basis at the North Sea drilling rigs run by Royal Dutch Shell.
The Wood Group, the Unite and the RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of trying to resolve the current dispute, read a joint statement.
We will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to get a fresh perspective on the problems.
According to the unions, their recent strike action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut the fees of North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressures.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
The company said that the additional cuts would give it the necessary flexibility to cope with the downward trend in the market.
Shell, meanwhile, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as the company lighten its operations following its giant merger with British energy firm BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with the leaders of the coalition earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of a generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
'We need an economy that works for the many, not just the few, both in the North Sea and across the country,' he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, compared with an average of about $7 billion over the previous five years.
Kepler is measuring the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiades
The latest Kepler mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete list of the rotational velocities of stars in the Pleiades.
The new information will help astronomers to understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds and how rotational times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can now learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for the Processing and Analysis of Caltech infrared data.
The Pleiades constellation is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching maturity.
They're at their peak now.
At their peak rotational speed, these maturing stars are blasting out large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow the stars down.
As the star ages, its rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The list of recent stellar rotational velocities suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with the larger ones making pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that the slowest spins are usually more massive, while the fastest spins are usually very light stars", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it's an ideal cosmic laboratory for estimating the properties of stars at their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades constellation provides an anchor for theoretical models of the rotation of stars that include both younger and older stars", Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down and, as it were, hang their "dancing shoes" on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational velocities of the Pleiades in three papers soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
