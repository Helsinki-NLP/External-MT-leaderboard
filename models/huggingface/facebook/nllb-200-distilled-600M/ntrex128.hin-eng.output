Welsh AMs are concerned about images like 'Mappets'.
Some members of the Assembly have been reluctant to suggest that their post should be renamed MWP (Welsh MP).
This is because the name of the Assembly is planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
All AMs involved in politics are concerned that this could make fun of them.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned about not linking it to the Twp and Pwp.
For readers living outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
One playmate said the whole group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said that its group was "independent" on the name change, but noted that the MWP could be mapped out by a small change in wording orally.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced in Welsh exactly as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legal draft on the name change, said: "The final decision of any commentator on what members of the Assembly are called will certainly be a matter for the members themselves".
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of public consultation on proposals that received substantial support for renaming the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the most support in public consultation was the MWP option.
Obviously, AM is suggesting many other options, but sitting official Elin Jones is having a hard time getting consensus, hoping to submit a draft law for change within a few weeks.
The legislation being prepared for the changes will also include other changes in the working methods in the Assembly, including the format of rules and committee system for the disqualification of AM.
When debating the lawmaking process, AMs will get the last vote on what they should be called.
The people of Macedonia are going to have a vote to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether or not to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was bid for a decades - old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province also named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour country's name refers to its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
A popular opponent of the name change, the Macedonian president, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zeev and voter supporters have argued that a name change is only a means of joining the EU and NATO.
The decline of churches in Harlem has led to a decline in the sound of St. Martin's bells.
"The elders I spoke to about history", said Mr. Adams, "say that before there were bars and churches on every street".
"Today, it's all coming to an end".
He said that reducing the bar is understandable.
He said, "People's society is being built differently today.
"Bars are no longer like the living room in the neighborhood where people go every day".
For churches, they worry that the money from selling property will not last as long as leaders expect, "and soon it will run out of money or later those leaders will return to exactly where they started".
He added that it is possible that the churches have been converted into apartment buildings with ownership rights that are inhabited by people of all kinds who will not help to safeguard the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
"The number of people who are buying houses in these buildings as ownership rights will continue to increase and so there will come a time when these churches will be closed completely, because it is unlikely that most of those who are coming in with ownership rights will become members of these churches", he said.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin's, both churches were built by white people from the religious community before Harlem's Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community was established.
The original white members of the Methodist religious community left in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who worshipped at the nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was taken over by a black religious community under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, a prominent place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but after Father Johnson's followers planned its reconstruction, the bell was rung here.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's successor, the pastor David Johnson, proudly called the bell "opening the doors of fortune to the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July described it as something like this: It is "a cultural heritage" and a precious historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng., an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first clock to be played by the black composer Dionysos A. Lind, who played a very large clock 18 years ago in Riverside Church.
Mr. Merrieweather said that no other person was put in his place at St. Martin.
What happened at St. Martin over the past few months has become a complex story of artisans and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the general leaders of the church and the rest by the religious provinces.
The vestry (where the worship goods are kept) became the property of the parish (priests of Ilake) made up of common leaders - in July the province expressed concern that the province would "seek to cover the costs for vestry, whether or not vestry is involved in the recruitment of craftsmen and contractors appointed in the province.
Some local priests complained of a lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark attack while diving to catch a shark
Officials say a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while he was snorkeling in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 am near Beacon Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hummel of KSWB-TV in San Diego said that on Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour, at the same time he heard a boy screaming for help and then he reached out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel said that at first he felt that the boy had sounded enthusiastic about catching a cockroach, but then he realized that he was shouting, 'Something is biting me!
Something is cutting me!'
Hummel said that when he saw the boy he found that the boy had burst his entire collarbone.
"I called everyone out of the water: there is a shark in the water!"
The teenager was admitted to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego where his condition is being assessed as critical.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Life - guard Captain Larry Gills told a media conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Gills further reported that the upper part of the victim 's torso is severely injured.
For investigative and security purposes, the authorities have blocked beach access from Ponto Beach, Caseblad to Swamis Beach, Assintas for 48 hours.
Gills reports that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to hire expert assistants with beauty products to include department store style boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
Despite the continued decline in sales of fashion and home goods, it is well on its way to joining the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, these large-scale beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the scheme is successful, the turnover will be increased in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing in TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that this will double its product offerings by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products from shops like Boots.
Supermarkets are also re-launching their boutique make-up products to make most products vegan - friendly - which will increase demand among small shoppers somewhat more rapidly.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will also check out the special feature at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is due to open in Selby Oak, Birmingham later this year.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e. supermarkets, in shifts where the daily quantity of food is sold is decreasing.
Mike Coop, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that people will be coming to the outlet more quickly, like department stores, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount providers Aldi and Lidl, who offer more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and since it introduced both chains two years ago, it has also opened several stores, suggesting that grocery sales have been boosted and the deal has become more profitable.
Previous efforts by supermarkets to bring beauty and pharmacy products back to market had failed.
Sainsbury's had been in business with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger had to be terminated due to the way the revenue from its supermarket pharmacies was split.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy stores to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Cellacio for £125 million, followed by a new strategy.
It said Lloyds will play a key role in the scheme by bringing together La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as several top luxury skincare brands in four stores.
Paul Mills - Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and colour of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also specially trained colleagues who will help us in advising.
We have built our brands into a more convenient location and to meet everyone's needs and attractive environments, which means we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones expressed his displeasure over Holly Willowby's departure from the £11m deal.
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones expressed displeasure when TV presenter Holly Biluby decided to part ways with Dragons Den star Peter Jones's £11m lifestyle brand business.
Bilubie has absolutely no time for his homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two businesses were being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow 's Goop brand.
The 37 - year - old morning presenter announced his split on Instagram.
Holly Bilubby separated herself from her charming lifestyle brand business with Dragons Den star Peter Jones at the last minute - to focus on her new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a stressful meeting at Jones's business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she was leaving her new deal - which is worth £1.5 million - Jones expressed resentment over it, meaning that Bilubby now does not have enough time to give up her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow 's brand Goop and was being considered to double from the estimated £11 million given by Willubi.
37-year-old Willubi announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly after Jones moved from Britain to move into one of her holiday homes.
A source reported: "Truly was once the top priority of Holi.
It was being considered as its long-term future, which would have made the brand so much more advanced in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to the start.
The warehouse at Marlowe headquarters is full of items to be sold".
Experts believe that the departure of Britain's richest star could cost the firm several million dollars as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewares and is also expected to delay its launch.
At the same time, it can also end a long friendship.
Biloubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Willubi started Truly in 2016 together with Cap and joined as Chairman in March, at the age of 52.
Holiday couples and Jones share 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Biloubi has now become M&S's brand ambassador and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"We would not like to discuss his business affairs", a source close to Jones reported last night.
Serious conversation 'and then we agreed'
He joked that the news media would continue to comment on him, that some would consider it a different job from the presidency and that they would be overly positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made such sacrifices?
Trump told his "News Anchor" voice.
"I have not given up any".
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, the first meeting marked a major step by Trump to make North Korea nuclear free.
But nuclear - free talks were stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Re Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for a "consistent response" from the US to its initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the US has continued to press for the continuation of the sanctions.
Trump's rally speech showed his very optimistic attitude.
We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea.
We were going to fight North Korea.
which would have killed millions of people.
Now our relationship has become very good.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing rocket tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remaining US troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual attitude in his talks on relations with Kim.
Pointing directly to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay in the presidency, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join the area, we'll have about 200 people to stop them".
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they did not need them for the event.
Despite the destruction of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, and a condition was also set for international aid.
Ms. Sumbau said, "In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly not asking for international help, so it became a bit more challenging".
Nevertheless, Save the Children visited Palau with a team, but it is not yet certain whether workers from other countries can come here to help.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the status of Palu, they were looking to see if international agencies would allow contributions to the relief effort.
Given the repeated situation in Indonesia, it seems that the country is not preparing for a natural disaster at all.
Although shelters have been built for tsunami victims in Ach, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
The tsunami warning siren in Palo has been reduced, however damaging the warning may be, it is likely to increase the loss of life.
Whether or not the best time to go for a walk is the time, it is challenging to cross many of Indonesia 's islands.
It is always complicated to arrange merchants and goods from natural disasters.
The victims of the earthquake are being transported to a hospital in Lombok for treatment which is far from Palau and takes at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very poor infrastructure a problem for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko 's administration was dispersed due to lack of funds as next year's reelection is due.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than 10,000 were left homeless as Christian and Muslim gangs fought each other in the streets using knives, bows, arrows and other dangerous weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, mysteriously bowed down and tied Chelsea
At Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute to save Liverpool from relegation from the Premier League.
At about 30 yards Sturridge caught up with Zerdane Shakiri, who was 1-0 behind Chelsea on goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a shot of Far Post.
His attempt went to the top right corner of the net with the height above the box.
The ball eventually fell out of the grip of Kapa Arijalbagala and went into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "It was just an attempt to get in the position to get in touch with the ball and get it as far away from players like Shaq as possible, so I tried to take as much time as possible for myself".
"I saw the spurs coming and I touched it once and didn't think much about it and just shot".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in halftime after the best player in Belgium, Aiden Hazard, scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball came close to the midfield and Liverpool reached the half, the Blues striker passed Mateo Kovasik in that game.
Kovashik delivered the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, he shot the ball beautifully, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard pulled out of the defence and shot off the net with his left foot from behind Liverpool's Allison Baker.
Liverpool will now face Napoli at 3pm on Wednesday in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face VideoTone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament has recently become the most famous monument, it was re-recorded in history.
Its expulsion would be the perfect justice for the destruction of many of England 's cultural and religious artifacts created by their radical Puritan followers, such as its Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing debate over the removal of the statues raised the full possibility that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
The emblem of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor built by Cromwell.
It may be wrong to think that Cromwell sacrificed himself in the last century for the works of his ancestor Thomas.
According to Sir William Hemo Thoroughoughoughbred, Cromwell's best representation is evidence of a 19th century idea and a piece of history of a statue that many still consider admirable.
"Cromwell is respected by many", Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "and perhaps that is why most people still know him today as the protector of Parliament against external pressures in the late 19th century when it came to monarchy.
Nevertheless, they are considered to be perfectly accurate representatives, which has historically been the subject of debate.
It is clear that our nation has been evolving since the conflict in the mid-17th century, and the Cromwell statue remains a private identity that reflects one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable.
A deadly pig attacked a Chinese farmer, killing the farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that only his surname "Yuan" has been identified as the person, his body was found with severe injuries, his body was found covered in blood near a pig barn in the market in Liupansui, Guizhou Province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Kinhai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig barn.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin who lived in nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin died and a pig 's lair was found open nearby.
He said that in the pig - den he saw a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guyang Evening News, his cousin, nicknamed V, said, "My cousin's legs were stained with blood and completely injured.
Security camera footage showed Yuan came to the market to feed his pigs at 4.40am on Thursday.
Her body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig attacking the person and killing him was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was kept locked up so that it could not attack anyone, although the police collected evidence after reviewing the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, even before this, rare cases of attacks on people by pigs have been recorded.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband at their farm causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was attacked and killed by his pigs, and a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but can be "dangerous" when they taste blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite their teeth and are very inquisitive... they don't hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remainder of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakened by moving into cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds of 85 mph were recorded in Rosa at 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, a Category 1 hurricane, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a mass of moisture is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much tropical moisture will begin to flow into the northern regions of the southwestern United States.
On Monday, some parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rain due to Rosa.
After that, the moisture from the pot will combine with tropical moisture in the coming days to bring heavy rain to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris runoff and landslides in the desert.
The extreme tropical humidity will cause rainfall to drop by 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Most of the southwestern parts, especially Arizona, are expected to experience 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The nature of the rainfall can cause excessive flooding in poor conditions.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be advised to stay out of low-lying deserts.
Heavy rainfall can make the valleys dangerous rivers and clouds will blow and dust will blow in the local areas.
The coming monsoon will cause heavy rainfall locally in parts of the southern California coast.
Over half an inch of rain is likely to be collected, which can lead to some debris and slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first wet season rainfall in the area.
Some slight tropical rainfall will begin to fall in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rain will be pouring over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
The month of October may be a fast-changing month for temperatures across the U.S. as the Arctic weather gets colder, but tropical areas remain quite hot.
Sometimes this short distance causes strange changes in temperature.
The strange temperature changes in the central U.S. on Sunday are a prime example.
Temperature variations between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa are about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the weather will start to warm and the heat will increase due to the heat.
Most areas of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to experience warmer weather from October, with a wide 80s in some areas from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate that there is a good chance that the Eastern U.S. temperatures will be above average for the first six months of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on Thursday watched the Supreme Court hearing of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who allegedly sexually abused Brett Cavanaugh, a woman named Christine Blacey Ford, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the hearing was seen on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political stalemate was also observed, with broadcasters blocking Friday's regular program Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI agent Jeff Flake after a week of investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh tried to get him drunk and undressed at a high school party.
Cavanough defended himself saying that he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people viewed Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was calculating average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not immediately available.
Also, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting the number of people he sees in offices.
From this perspective, it is equal to the number of spectators for a playoff football game or Academy Award.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News channel, which the presenter has been a big supporter of Kavanaugh's appointment, has been ahead of all channels, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it came in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
There was a lot of interest in the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
A post-term statement issued by the Liberal Republican office said he would speak for Kavanaugh, who appeared on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, screaming to protest the hearing of the rallying judicial committee at the time.
When they were being insulted, they stood up for a few minutes, and it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Let me, I'm standing right here in front of you.
"Do you think they are telling the country the right thing?
She was asked, "Were you brought to power to make a lot of women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and said that he would be able to give his full statement at the committee hearing.
While the Judiciary Committee was pushing forward Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote to the entire Senate, the cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live after hours.
But, Flack said, they will do so with full understanding that the FBI will look into the charges against the nominees next week, which are being urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake discussed this with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake loved power because it was clear that approving Cavanough without a vote would not get the Republicans to vote.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanough.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of politicizing Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics to stop playing with the future of Britain by making "politics a game" in the EU and focus on national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29th September 2018.
On the front page of the newspaper, right next to his interview, was his interview with former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on himself due to the so-called Brexit checker plan, his statement was that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other which is completely meaningless.
Wade Sims shot: Police arrested a suspect in the death of an LSU player, Dayton Simpson
Police have detained a suspect for shooting and killing Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Wade LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge Police Department reports that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been taken into custody and sent to prison for second-degree murder.
The video of the encounter between Sims and Simpson was released by the authorities, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the encounter.
Police have recovered glasses from the scene and have reported that the WAFB report linked to CBS found the DNA belonging to Simpson.
After Simpson was questioned, the police reported that he shot Wade deadly to death.
The lawyer's report said that he was set to receive $350,000 for this.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released an initial report on Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the area's people who assisted in the investigation for detention.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alaleva thanked the law in place in the area for its "work and justice seeking".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6 feet 6 inches tall, raised in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne lives, and also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team has been "dispersed" and "very sad" by Wade's death.
"The question of who will take his place will always remain", Wade said.
The volcanic ash was found in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocépital volcano has been found in the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano, observing activity at the volcano's mouth, and reported that 183 gas and ash eruptions have been recorded in 24 hours.
The centre was keeping a close eye on several shocks and vibrations.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated car windshields in neighborhoods like Exochimilco, Mexico City.
In September 2017, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico, since geophysicists have noticed increasing activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists from Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six Barcelona residents were detained after a clash of pro-independence protesters with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of opponents joined protests on the first anniversary of the Catalan vote on segregation.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powder paint on riot police, which turned the street dust black, causing a problem for commuters.
The police used their rods to control the clash and later even made a handshake.
Pro-independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no apology" for hours while union protesters chanted "Spain to remain".
According to local press reports, 14 people who were injured due to the demonstration were treated.
The referendum on October 1, which is considered illegal in Madrid, has been increasing tensions in independent-minded areas for a year, but Catalonia's separatist-minded people were celebrating it.
Voters chose a very good way to get independence, although there were few who strongly opposed the vote against isolation.
Catalan officials said that about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to the polling stations in the area amid clashes.
Freedom - supporting groups stayed there overnight on Friday to assist the National Police in stopping the demonstration.
The demonstration was postponed, but he had to make a different decision.
Electrician Narcisse Terminus, 68, who arrived with his wife to participate in the separatist protests, said he saw no possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
Our best year was last year.
I saw my parents expressing their happiness by voting, but now it seems that we are stuck, he said.
Despite a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain influence with many of their prominent leaders, whether in exposing themselves or waiting for a barrier to their role in organising the polls and continuing to declare independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to help the police, said the clash between the politicians of both sides had been stopped.
He said, "It's become too stressful.
On Saturday Orol Junqueiras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial jails since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"To contest the European elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the return we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
London Derry: Car attackers arrested

In some places the crossing may have been attacked by a car.
Menga defeated Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's win.
According to the manager of the Ibrox club, the fast-moving Livingston shocked the Rangers, forcing Steven Gerard to take responsibility for only his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga 's strike made the difference that was equated by Gary Holt 's side move to the Hibs in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side is one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the Leaders Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston has been winning the six-game division consecutively by replacing head coach Holt with Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed showing the visitor his game.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before the score, and their excellent game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was left behind by the goal attempt, then Alan Lithgow slipped and tried his best to stay straight to finish the goal in Craig Hulkett's header.
The hosts had the opportunity to play against Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor in trouble on set pieces.
And this is how he got the important goal.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingston opened, DeKlan Gallegher and Robinson set up the manga, which scored a touchdown and a score from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left behind,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on Kelly being saved.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor on his feet and Lithgow took full control of the game by flicking from the other Livingston.
Crosses continued to come and go in Livingston Box, while two penalty claims were made following Hulkett's challenge, one involving bringing in Glenn Middleton and the other involving the handball.
The analysis of Livingston's 'extraordinary goal'
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont was inducted into the Tony McCarthy Arena
Livingston's exceptional performance and results.
For anyone, they were the best, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His style of play and personality have changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but the most credible attribution goes to Holt's way of re-imagining the team since his arrival.
He had many great players.
Captain Hulkett was a great player, he served well, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall behind him.
However, the Rangers lacked learning.
The kind of good performance he has done many times under Gerard was below his standard.
His final ball was short - he was only able to cut to his home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdoğan was welcomed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles were scattered but no benefit was achieved.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations with NATO allies.
They were caught up in controversies over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan spoke about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside Turkey, the city is one of the most densely populated areas of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, speaking of security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters - some of them Kurdish - also chanted slogans against Erdogan, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-way protests saw a split between those welcoming the visitor, some calling him a German Turk hero and others insulting him as a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: A bicycle rider died after being hit by a car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 BST in the southeastern suburbs of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and brought him to the emergency room, but the person died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago in a hit and run on Children's Street about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said that the authorities were working to identify the person and inform his family.
Such incidents are occurring due to the bending of the road and the diversion of buses and drivers are advised to avoid such areas.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured due to the riot
The Jail Office said six prison officials were injured due to the chaos in the high security men's prison.
A disturbance occurred at around 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officials have been called in to fix the mess, the mess is in a wing that has eight prisoners.
Minor facial injuries were sustained by the rights activists at the scene who were treated.
A Prison Service spokesperson reported: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to repair the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons at all, and it is obvious that those responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and may be arrested.
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by a prisoner, after which the prison governor was treated in hospital.
In addition, riot officials were summoned to jail in October last year to correct a serious disorder, during which an employee was attacked from a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to cause severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
The threat to the tropics has remained high after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is highly likely that this is what the remaining capacity of the storm could be for the coming week, leaving the desert southwest at risk of heavy flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service announced that there were already high-water flooding fears in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah in western Arizona.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to make Rosa clear through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression since 1950!"
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ boundary".
The recent National Hurricane Center Model has predicted that the Mogollon Rim in Arizona may receive 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a chance of up to 6 inches.
In the Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, rainfall is likely to be 1 to 2 inches and possibly up to 4 inches.
Outside areas at high risk of flooding, Rosa rainfall can prove a boon because the area is droughty.
Although flooding remains a serious concern, drought conditions in the Southwest are still present and are likely to benefit greatly from the rainfall.
According to the U.S. Draft Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to a report by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Hurricane Rosa had a maximum sustained wind speed of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is now heading north at 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific, which is causing its strength to decline.
Thus, it is expected that the force of the tropical storm could cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is likely in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
According to the report of Weather.com, it is expected that from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, it may rain from 3 to 6 inches, and it is also likely to rain 10 inches.
It then becomes a tropical storm that will move northward into Arizona on Tuesday morning before reaching the border with Mexico, then southward into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat to Roosa or its remnants lies in California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where heavy rainfall is likely", reports the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these rains could cause rapid flooding and debris flows in the deserts, threatening the people - wealth and causing landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four people arrested for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor was found in Somerset with a wound, stabbed to death and has been detained for conspiracy to murder three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital for treatment where his condition is being reported as "correct".
Avon and Somerset Police reported that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from the Redstock area.
The authorities have also appealed to the people to contact if any person has any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump called the quarrel of Kwanaugh the anger of the Democratic Party
At a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said, "Justice Kavanaugh is a man who has been rejected by the Democratic Party's ruthless and insulting strategy".
Trump says the trouble Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared Congress of the charge that she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh as a teenager by Christine Blessy Ford, while Kavanaugh has strongly and emotionally denied the allegation.
Ford also testified about the charge during the hearing.
"The people of the United States saw the virtues and courage of being the best man in Kavanaugh that day", the President said on Saturday.
"Voting Justice Kavanaugh means voting for someone who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, who can uphold the law and do justice with a real record of public service", he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kvanaugh.
There are only five weeks left of the most important election in our lives.
I am not involved in this, but I am actually involved", he said.
"That is why I am fighting for all the candidates who are truly worthy".
Trump said the Democrats are on a campaign to "opposite and impede".
A senior GOP associate told CNN that the first Senate vote counting for Kwanaugh's nomination is scheduled to begin on Friday.
Hundreds of people died in the earthquake, tsunami, and death toll in Indonesia are rising.
On Saturday, officials said that when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high tide began to rise in the sea, killing at least 384 people.
On Friday, a festival was being held on the beach in the city of Palo, where hundreds of people gathered, and when the six meter (18 ft) high waves rose after dark, it caused a disaster, killing many people and destroying everything around them.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami risked yesterday, people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately and got caught up", said Sutopo Purwo Nugaroh, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only killed people, but also dragged cars, logs and houses to the ground", said Nugroho. "The tsunami travelled at an open sea speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the beach", said Nugroho.
He said that some people climbed trees to protect themselves from the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palau.
Photos posted by the Disaster Agency from the airplane showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were turned and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the post - shock continued on the rocks in the coastal town.
2.4 million people in the region experienced the continuous earthquake.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy capacity of the massive earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times greater than the capacity of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said that the geography of a city on a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho explained the damage in detail, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said that the debris of the collapsed buildings had trapped the bodies of some people and injured 540 people while 29 people have not been identified.
The area of Dongla, 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palau, near the epicentre of the quake, is expected to suffer heavy casualties and damage, Ngroho said.
The communication system in Dongla was "completely damaged", Ngrogo reported.
In a statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people are living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It said, "It is a tragic event at first, but it can be even more terrible".
On Saturday, the agency criticized why the tsunami was not announced earlier, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already gone.
A person made some videos amateurishly and posted on social media that showed a person standing on the top floor of a building being heard by people on the street below and a terrible warning could be heard.
Within minutes, huge amounts of water began to flow out of the center, dragging buildings and cars along.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power failure in Palau and cutting off communication lines making it difficult for the authorities to link rescue efforts together.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials have started sending cargo planes, officials said that people still need to be evacuated and food and other needs are met.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
This is terrible.
Shri Dosheba said that World Vision staff based in Donggala have made every effort to secure the city of Palo, the staff have been building shelters with turrets in their office courtyard, they have seen the disaster with their own eyes.
He said, "We talked to them and they saw many houses being destroyed.
This is terrible.
Aid groups began to seriously bring in disaster relief supplies, some complained that outside aid personnel with special expertise were being denied access to the pallu.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign funds, supplies and staff assistance can only be obtained when the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
But, this has not been done yet.
"The disaster is still at the provincial level", said Auliya Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"Once the government says that it is a national disaster, we can only involve international aid personnel in the rescue but this has not happened yet".
Even after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family members of those who had not been identified in Palau were hoping that their loved ones would be miraculously found, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was found trapped in the sewer.
Rescue team rescued a woman from the rubble on Sunday, with her child stranded in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gandan Subando trained two Asian Games paragliders to track down missing people, who had been dedicated to this task in Indonesia since the beginning of this month.
Mr. Mandagi was also among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel with his students.
As a senior in the para-glide field, I am also emotionally depressed.
Mr. Gendon said that the para-gliding community started its work after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, they had sent messages via WhatsApp to the Palu contestants participating in the Beach Festival.
However, only grey marks appear on their messages, not blue marks.
He said, "I think that means that the messages could not reach people".

Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to this.
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this one.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: "Officially his name will remain Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the name for some time and will use it for his eighth album titled Moniker, released in June.
This change is being made to his presence on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yindi.
The show's creator said that he has removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had "refused to join the show for emotional reasons".
In addition to shortening his current professional name, West had already stated that the word had religious significance for him.
Speaking to the radio host Big Boy about the title of his album earlier this year, West said, "I believe that the word 'ye' is used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you.'
So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It's taken from the word kanye, which means one, which is one - it represents our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album shows who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who changed their name.
Scene Combs also has several names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Diddie or Diddie, but this year they have changed their name to Love and Brother Love when announcing the name.
An old friend of West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
The AMLO of Mexico vowed not to use military force against civilians.
On the 50th anniversary of the country's deadly retaliation against students, Mexican President-Candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that military force would never be used against civilians again.
At the Teltec Plaza on Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised that "military force will never be used to pressure the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in the Plaza, killing more than 300 people, as leftist student protests spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexico's youth, grant students a scholarship every month and open more and more free public universities.
He said that youth are becoming involved in crime because of unemployment and low opportunities to get an education.
The U.S. should double the funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Li, a downsizing investor and AI entrepreneur for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field.
AI has commented after many U.S. government actions, he also said that the U.S. lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: It aims to reach number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget will be a great start, " Lee said, "looking at all the other countries separately, the U.S. is far behind on this, and we are working toward the next success of AI".
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the fund could double the likelihood that AI's next big achievement will be in the US.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovaction Ventures, is an investor in Face++, one of China's best AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that left the highest ranked American Othello player far behind, and he was later appointed to the executive position at Microsoft Research and the president position at Google's China branch.
Lee outlined the technical capabilities of the previous U.S. government, including the robotic challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government to identify the next visionary.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often face considerable difficulties in obtaining government assistance.
"It's not China removing academic leaders, it's corporate", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university dignitaries to work on AI.
Lee said that by changing the immigration policy, the US can be helped in its AI efforts.
He said, "I think that getting permission to do PhD in AI through green card should be done by yourself.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
Li said, "The National Natural Science Foundation of China is funding academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are funding U.S. researchers, but the quality of education in China is not very good.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Furthermore, this month DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next which talked about investment of 2 billion dollars.
For NSF, this investment is now over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation was enacted in the U.S. that would ignore the demand for a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence for months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece over the boycott of its EU and NATO membership bids.
There is also a province in Greece called Macedonia, which claims its northern neighbor is named after its territory, which has become two names for the same claim and is already included in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it, saying that the name change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not go to the referendum and boycott the campaign, he doubted that the minimum required for this vote would be 50 percent votes.
The ballot paper will have the following question: 'Do you approve the agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?'
Prime Minister Zoran Zeev and supporters of the name change say that Macedonia needs to become a member of bodies like the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I am here to vote for the future of the country, the future for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely in the shadow of the EU because it means safe lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijeva, 79, who lives in Skopje.
While legally not pushing for it, most members of parliament say they will act according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two - third majority is required for a change of name in Parliament.
The State Election Commission says that no irregularities were reported as of 1 pm.
However, in 2016 when the last parliamentary election was held, only 16 per cent of the votes were cast, compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters casting their votes.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said 62 - year - old voter Gozo Tanewski, who lives in Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zeev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dusko, went to Macedonia to vote for the country's name change, so that the name of the country in Stromika, Macedonia, would join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kvardarkov, 54, of Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of Parliament and was setting up chairs in front of the tents of those who would oppose the vote.
"We should have NATO and EU membership, but we want to join NATO by lifting our heads, not by an agreement", Kavarkov said.
Our country is poor but we also have our own self-respect.
If they don't want us to subscribe to Macedonia, it doesn't matter, we can join other countries like China and Russia to become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zev has said that NATO membership will provide a very important investment for Macedonia, with unemployment rate above 20 per cent.
After his vote, Zhev said, "I think a lot of votes will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO".
He said that the result of "yes" would "confirm our future".
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the necessary voting.
A second survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 percent of votes are required for a successful vote.
If the vote fails, the Western government's policy, which was formed in May last year, will suffer the first serious blow.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City forced the whole Brighton to defend to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played a strong defense against Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City on Saturday.
Ironically, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was passed in the early stages of the midfield.
On his way to the open field, he defended against three Brighton players.
After that Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a defender before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward in the box used his first touch to return the ball to Aguero, Aguero beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan using his left boot and the ball passed through his right side and went into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters, "Aguero has some leg problems that are troubling him".
We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early lead in the Premier League.
In the 29th minute he scored.
In that game Aguero got the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball from the left side of Leroy Sen.
Sen made a few touchdowns before sending away the good-playing Sterling.
Just before the game slipped out of hand, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League group play will now be played against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 pm in Sinsim, Rhine-Neckar-Arena, Germany.
Shaser wants to beat him by playing the Rockies.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no reason to push for another start.
But, always competitive, Scazzer expects to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the Rockies still have a playoff chance, winning a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies earned a wild-card spot by winning 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to clinch the First Division title.
"We may not be playing well, but we can at least play to know that Denver's atmosphere with the crowd and second team will probably be the highest level game I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play that game?"
The Nationals have yet to comment on the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that Shaser could be included in such a situation.
Shaser, who is playing for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to Brett Kavanaugh as referring to his situation around the Supreme Court.
"All the work we have done will be on the line in November.
We are only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
He said, "This is a big election - I am not involved in it, but I am indeed involved, because I am fighting for all the great candidates. "
Trump added, "You can look at this very terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now.
Furthermore, they are trying to seize power by other necessary means, which you know is pointless and useless.
They don't care who is unhappy or who is capable of it, they just want power and control, but we won't let that happen.
He said the campaign of the Democrats is "to oppose and hinder".
"Also, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you have seen the anger of the Democrats and also how meaningful and evil they are.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by referring to the name of Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who was highly appreciated by the audience.
Remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
What?
No, no, I'm waiting for the one whose body language was really bad -- such bad body language I've never seen.
Working is no longer broad church.
It is not acceptable to those who speak their minds.
When the activists who were promoting my local party voted for me, it was a big surprise to me.
After all, I am the newest of the Labour MPs who have become very insignificant - we cannot say all we have in mind.
This is where my MP colleague, John Ryan, was also present because he too had raised his voice for socialism.
In my case, the censor motion condemned me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, there were explicitly similar problems in Europe that Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders on.
"We want all the things included in the meeting to be beneficial", the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday.
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I have seen that the Friday night GC meetings are very much the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today are not consensual and the politics of "kind and kind people" are actually forgotten, as was the case here.
It is clear that if there are differences in views within the Labour Party, they are not tolerated and for each opinion it is decided whether the party is acceptable to the leadership.
It started right after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I had thought would have my political views started expecting me to turn my back on my words and work in positions I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - I get seen on social media with bad words, sharp comments, criticism of the Centre's politics and I'm told I'm not worthy of the Labour Party.
Besides, it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are politically connected.
I know how business people work and I am dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but do not shy away from raising their voices.
There are many frustrating aspects of the current political era, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party needed to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer broad church and the change in every "disbelief" proposal or party selection rule is very small.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to keep quiet, not to talk too much, and then I would be "accredited".
But I didn't come into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was involved in labour as a school student, I was urged to oppose the Thatcher government, told to leave my school's wider classroom altogether, and demanded better public services for those who needed them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and no area disagrees about my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that as the country is moving towards Brexit which is damaging to homes, businesses and our public services, I do not feel the need to waste my time and energy in showing my sincerity to the Labour Party.
But, in fact, I have a message that is not for the Nottingham moment, it is for my supporters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no risk of choice or political campaigning can interfere with my work, I am only interested in what is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten ear reaches the top
Two late attempts may have some effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr Tenant deserved to win this great entertaining match of the premiership.
Now they are only top of the table of ten undefeated sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he got the best opportunity he could, which led to him moving the home team forward and giving coach Peter Murchi the chance to be happy.
"We've thoroughly tested our game and we're still undefeated, so it makes me happy".
"The credit goes to Ayr", said Robin Christy of Mellorose, "who made the most of his opportunity".
Grant Anderson 's 14th minute effort forced Frazier Klimot to face Ayr, but Warriors gave Scottish player Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Bagen recovered the very difficult effort.
With the penalty just before halftime, Klymo raised the lead, scored a goal and then tried to tie the match 17-5 for the lead at break time.
But Melrose improved in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was turned into a goal by Baggott, which reduced Livy's five points.
After that, Ruridis Knott suffered a serious injury that forced him to hold the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the game started, Ayr went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowall, who was turned by Clime into a goal.
At the time, Ireland captain Blair McPherson had received a yellow card, and then due to the excessive pressure at the end of the game, Mellorose gave an extra man Bruce Calvin an attempt that failed to win.
However, the host team was left behind and when Straun Hutchinson received a yellow card from the penalty line-out due to facing the climax of the Bill Ball, McPherson scored a touchdown, pushing Ayr backwards.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off the flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the home side, Klimmo turned it into a round, as they could have done at the resumption of the game.
The game's stars are still looking for new careers in the restaurant industry.
The game's star Ford Keiran is still looking for ways to move into the hospitality industry, having recently been chosen to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56 - year - old Jack Jarvis is associated with the popular BBC show, where he works as a writer and has long been a sideman of comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it seems they are planning what to do with Kearnen after Craigslist.
Based on the official record list, he is a director of Adriftmorne Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kearnen wanted to join a "big restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have our right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Military - naval personnel are patrolling the naval headquarters of La Paz on a large scale.
Ocean-Blue flags are being flown on government buildings.
The motto of the naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is: "We have the right to the sea".
It is our duty to recover it.
After losing to Chile in the 19th century's terrible land struggle, the coastal region of Bolivia is still desperate to regain its land - they want to wave their flag once again in the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope to regain their Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia is now full of excitement, there is a sense of unity and peace, and a positive outcome is about to be achieved", said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calajilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the decision from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been negotiating for decades - which has been forced by negotiations to Chile to return Bolivia's land to the sea.
Bolivia's best president, Evo Morales - who is about to face a controversial contest in next year's re-election - also expressed his positivity in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he said, "We are very close to regaining the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's best interest - and if it is, there will be plenty of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no right to reward the province of Chile, and has decided that the possible outcome of the negotiations will not be determined.
Paz Zeret, a Chilean expert at the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the final talks, which suggested the case was not complicated.
Furthermore, apart from the conditions of Bolivia, it seems that over the last four years it may return to its former state.
The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia, Jairett said.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement has destroyed Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but this time it will be very difficult to negotiate after the decision is made.
Since 1962, ambassadors of both countries have not been living in each other 's country.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, representative in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was unusually speedy.
He said that Monday will be a great opportunity for Bolivia to open new relations with Chile and "to end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefits".
Calazila has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicising the maritime issue.
He said that Bolivia will never back down for its right of access to the Pacific Ocean.
The decision is an opportunity to know what we needed to do in the past.
North Korea has said that nuclear testing will not stop until it has confidence in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong Ho has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bombs until Washington has confidence.
On Saturday, Rey addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He asked the United States to fulfill the pledges made during the Singapore Summit between the leaders of other countries.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feels that he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korean Kim Jong - un made his pledges in Singapore.
Re said this was a "pipe dream" that would lead the North to give up on sanctions and U.S. objections to declare an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the consensus of the important disarmament campaign already underway without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But it is entirely questionable that Pyongyang is serious about ending the inspection of the atomic bomb because they do not want to jeopardize the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which will be held at the will of both Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show showed a variety of newly designed headwear for the nearby High Street.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Tom Brown have created a series of top-notch headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that appeared at the famous Paris Fashion Week of particular style.
The best useful hats are made to survive this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to showcase in the show.
The best hats Valentino made were large enough to be decorated with a wide winged rim that hung around the model's head.
Another accessory with a very large side included a bezel-designed waterman hat, a wizard hat, and a pineapple-designed hat - but they are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Tom Brown also showed special-designed masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were amazed at the many colorful masks and saw things like a hainy lecturer rather than a haunted cowherd.
One creation saw all kinds of scuba diving equipment including snowbells and glasses, while the other creation saw a melting ice cream cone design.
Also, if you've seen more fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion enthusiasts expect this great collection to soon reach the great stores around you.
The very large size hat will be available with a boom - designed heel, with a two - foot wide straw hat with a breeze that will be available to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The best-performing hat was labeled a cult that looked pretty, with a second creation posted on social media, Catwalk - showing a model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag, trimmed with Rafia fringes and fitted with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jaquimus' La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMA: "I hope that for the coming summer season, big hats and beach bags will be coming to the shops soon - because designers have been so impressed that it will be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories".
John Edward: Foreigners need to have language skills.
Private schools in Scotland have a track record of excellent education, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver excellent test results, strengthening individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated to The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) under their leadership, which is working to provide the best possible service to its pupils and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and places benefit foreign nationals.
As an education sector that can build and implement school curricula, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be chosen in schools as an alternative to popular and desired subject matter.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you become better for them.
If you speak to him in his language, he will be very pleased.
When we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries, we think we can trust English more.
Recently, this year's test results show that the languages with the highest pass rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68% of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of pupils achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of pupils achieved the highest grade A in German, 69 per cent of pupils in French and 63 per cent of pupils in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are cooperating in foreign languages to provide children and young people with the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being incorporated as an alternative subject in private school curricula and other things like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that employers struggled to recruit staff for vacant positions, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming mandatory for young people to have more language skills to prepare them for their future careers.
These skills are essential for working anywhere in the world because of the high potential employment opportunities that language requires.
Whatever career path is chosen, if people have learned a second language, such skills will surely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreigners, being a multilingual person will give you a head start in the competition.
In 2013, a survey of more than 4,000 British adults by YouGov found that 75 percent of the population could not speak a foreign language fluently enough and that only French was the subject that 15 percent of the population could speak and was the only language to reach the double-digit percentage.
This is why it is now necessary to invest in teaching children languages.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find the right job.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are oriented towards 2020 and considered most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest your child has in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find staff who are experts in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need to succeed, so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be denied that language learning in the country is essential for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should be truly accepted as international communication skills.
The choice, diversity and excellence of young people in Scotland will continue to be offered by private schools.
I must do well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron started Sunday in San Diego as part of the Lakers.
Now the waiting hour for Lebron James fans is about to end as he is about to play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the preseason opener to play against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But the minutes they will play are yet to be decided.
The Lakers reported through the official website that they will play at least one minute and no more than 48 minutes.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudeau tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers ' six-game pre-season schedule.
He said, "At this stage of my career, I don 't need to be prepared for precision games.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump held a rally for the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Next week Trump has scheduled five more rallies including Tennessee and Mississippi as well as other favorable locations.
With his election to a vacancy on the Supreme Court to block votes scheduled for appointment, Trump's goal is to seek support for the upcoming midterm election as there is a risk of Republicans falling out of Congress' control at the time of the November vote count.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7pm ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump may address this week's hearing for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been held back for a week during the FIT investigation due to allegations of sexual misconduct on Kavanaugh.
But the main goal of this stressful rallying scene is to help Republicans face the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign that the five rallies next week are intended to fuel enthusiasm among volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and increase their blocked majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.
According to Reuters, the spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said that congressional control has become so important to his agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season will be very busy.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling could bring the attention of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to help candidate Patrick Morris, who is behind in the West Virginia Republican Senate poll.
According to Reuters, political scientist Simon Heather of West Virginia University said, "If the president is trying to get Morris an edge in the election, it is not a good sign for him".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show a willingness to compete to maintain their expectations of top position in Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will decide what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The cycle of time is a completely new concept for players, but when and who to trust cannot be predicted in competitions like this.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
As he walked through the day, Jordan Speeth said, "He had a six point lead which has now become four, so I think we need to step up our pace a little bit.
Europe certainly took advantage and took 12 points in the game to four points ahead.
According to Spyeth, the American feels that they have a few more chances left and a lot to encourage, not only from Spyeth's form but also from Justin Thomas's form, who played together all day and both scored three out of four points from their game.
Spyth is deadly to everyone from T to Green and is also the best in the game.
The crowd cheered with enthusiasm as he and Thomas went down two points after two, making a significant push to complete four all-squares.
His put was what got his team into 15th position with the same scream, a sort that tells you that you don't take the American team out of it.
Speeth said, "You really just have to play well and make sure that the win is yours".
That is what all players who have been out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only two players with more points than Spyth and Thomas in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are making new history in the Ryder Cup.
The pair, with different styles but better than Europe, scored four points out of four and led the way.
On Saturday afternoon, "Mollywood" is the only couple who did not shoot a buggy, but they stayed away from the buggy until before 9 am on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
On Sunday, the way to get that run and that run was in this overwhelming crowd and this overwhelming crowd was as if they were beating players, and there is no player who could turn the potential victory of the European team into a defeat, it seemed like the sunset of the Le Golf National would be earlier than Fleetwood or Molinary.
It would be nice if both of them were on different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of Europeans has been discussed for a long time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, who was created with his partner Alex Noren at the time.
One boxer in front of nine dogs and two doubles, Spaniard and Swede made the hole before they had never been able to get here.
However, there was no one present on Sunday who could help you get to your hole.
Foreball and Foressum were great at seeing because the interaction between the pairing was quite good, they advised that they did not need to consult and they are well acquainted with how to change the strategy.
Europe played well as a team and took a significant lead on the final day, but this forums session also showed that Team USA has the ability to compete in a way that is questionable, especially on the Stateside.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take advantage of this on the final day of the Ryder Cup, following a 10-6 draw against the United States on Saturday.
The best pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over Tiger Woods, who were struggling with two wins to take their match far ahead of the Le Golf National by four points.
In retaliation for his trophy defeat two years ago at Hazeltine, Thomas Beazorn was overtaken by a misfire by the American side in the European side of the Morning Forball, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the Forums, winning two games, but they could not avoid defeat.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy win.
Fleetwood are the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari started off with "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Forball, he again beat the best players Woods and American rookie Bryce Deschambo by 5 and 4 points, performing better than ever.
Wood, who had a two-match lead on Saturday, showed his best performance but has now lost 19 of his 29 Forball and Forsam matches and seven Roos.
The rest of the morning forball team returned to the forums with Justin Rose and his partner Henrik Stenson, defeating world ranked first and third players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopeka 2-1.
However, Europe had no break on Pleasant, Breezy Day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners on Saturday, key players Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas, set the benchmark for the Americans by two points.
He won the Forball with a spectacular 2-1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter and sent Pauls and Rory McClary back to the starting two holes, 4-3.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team returned from a single match with four points, although the need for the Furic side kept everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the Sunday counter-attack, after two days of second-best, is going to be different from their old game.
North Korea said that saying 'there is no way' would only make disarmament a part that cannot be trusted.
The North Korean foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations has continued sanctions that were based on its distrust of the United States and showed no way to allow the country to abandon its nuclear bomb inspection on its own merits under such circumstances.
Lee Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly that last year North Korea tried several ways that were "importantly benevolent", such as stopping nuclear bomb and missile testing, demolishing the test site, and promising not to continue the work on nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "However, we have not received any response from the US for this.
"Without any reliance on the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such situations there is no way we can begin unilateral disarmament".
While Re reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington's "step by step" approach to disarmament under which North Korea will gradually benefit, his statement makes it perfectly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left alone by one side as Pyongyang has done before.
At the summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader, which first took place in Singapore on June 12, Lee cited a statement jointly made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, when Kim pledged to work toward "the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons production.
Washington has also opposed calls to lift strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US has first emphasized disarmament and increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective by force, and at the same time, it has also objected to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" said Lee.
"The curfew can bend us, such a perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that the constant ban is making us less confident.
Rey did not discuss the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, saying the US leader had spoken out about the UN's strengths last week.
Instead, the Minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party to this disarmament problem is South Korea and not the US, then the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a standoff".
Nevertheless, Re's speech was very different from last year's speech when he told the UN National Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korean rockets after President Trump, who was dubbed the "Rocket Man" on the Suicide Mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courage to raise for disarmament but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no deadline for it, "If it takes two years, three years, or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The Security Council's sanctions should remain in place until we realize without any failure that we are completing a final and verified disarmament".
The Security Council has extended sanctions on North Korea in 2006 with full agreement to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then informed that he would be heading back to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, with North Korea denouncing him for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
At a monthly meeting this month, North Korea pledged to destroy the missile site and if the United States takes appropriate measures, it will destroy the nuclear complex as well.
He said that Kim had promised him "conforming measures", they were seeking security guarantees that Trump would take a resolution in Singapore and they would move towards a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for a comfortable job.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get more and more relaxation while competing with the growing macho culture through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters' study.
The teacher who teaches students at the number one university in the world often has no choice when it comes to the most common things about what to do to relax.
Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Charles Kaizler, has created a course he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the effect of sleep deprivation during teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
He told The Telegraph, "I had a girl come to me at the end of the year and she said, 'Why do I always say that I have to go to the next class next year?'
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
This year, for the first time, students will learn about the importance of good sleep habits in reading and athletic performance, and will also improve their overall health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said students don't get enough sleep every week for which the university decided to launch the course.
The hours - long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormery room where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to explain what effect caffeine and light will have on the sleep deprivation on athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
Professor Zesler said, "We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they should know about it - just as smoking knows about its health effects.
He said that the culture of feeling proud of 'wake up all night reading' still exists, modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough and good sleep is like a secret weapon for students, which helps them to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. It also prevents weight loss because lack of sleep keeps their brain thinking about hunger and making them feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Prof. Jessler build the course, completing his last year's class at Harvard during the past year.
He said that the course brought awareness and inspiration for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that all postgraduate students will be deemed to have completed this course before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Jessler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before bedtime, as well as deciding when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too much circadian stress on them and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 's 1-0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
The strikes by Dolly Menga caused the Rangers to run into trouble in another match, with the responsibility of Livingston 's 1-0 win being placed on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
The Ebro side were looking for their first win after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team urged Gerard as manager for a second loss in 18 games to knock out Landbrooks Premiership leader Hertz by eight points.
The MEGA strikes for seven minutes before halftime and after that the Rangers line-up shorts never got a chance to level the game.
However, the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place in the standings, Livingston has moved up to third place and is only behind the Hibernians due to goal difference.
In addition, the game may be even more troublesome for Rangers since Lineman Calum Spence's head injury has been treated after the object is clearly thrown at the other end.
Eight changes to Gerard 's side allowed the previous Ayr to reach the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same Levi 11 that took a point of injuries last week and the way he drilled well caused the opposition team to get into trouble every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, he should have given him only two minutes, but the midfielder took his big chance.
When Keegan Jacobs in the Deep kicked a free kick, the kick went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow on the back post could only make the stab wide.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they were more confident in their game than they were in their hope.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been penalized for the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless had collided, but referee Steven Thompson had rejected Columbian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibro goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties with strikes by Lasana Colliby's header and Twey O'Vee Azaria.
However, Livi's opener could have gone against the run of the game in the 34th minute, but no one can deny that he alone is entitled to the graft.
Even then, the best player in the Rangers Deep could not beat Jacob.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson had kept the manga quiet to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped the Collibel for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect as soon as he was sloted by the winger in Morelos, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line with a good run.
But Livingstone showed the visitors the kind of game they could really enjoy, he swept the long ball with a litho and a halcyon after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have increased his lead, but before being cornered by Litgovo, McGregor prevented Jacobs from studing up well.
The Rangers called on Glenn Middleton as an alternate, he made another late claim for the penalty because he was involved with the Jacobs, but Thompson did not let him succeed again.
Elmanack: Inventor of the Geyser counter
Now a page of our Sunday Morning calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiser was born in Germany.
Geyser invented a device later known as the Geyser counter for detecting and measuring radioactivity.
Geiger is a mainstay of counter science, it has become a mainstay of pop culture, as well as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which first starred scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
Once you turn on these earphones, you can certainly hear the effects of hidden atoms in minerals due to radioactivity".
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely popping up right now!"
Hans Geiser died in 1945, aged about 63.
But his invention has kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine can detect damaged immune cells.
The new cancer vaccine can detect and eliminate damaged immune cells.
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify damaged cells during treatment.
This method can be used in a laboratory to extract and replace a patient's immune cells.
Then, they can be shown to have a common protein for many cancers and then removed and re-implanted.
A trial for the vaccine is seeing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was vaccinated, which looked at her damaged immune system cells, and then found that her ovarian cancer, which had been around for more than 18 months, had gone away.
This method can be used to remove and replace a patient's immune cells in a laboratory to "see" a common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then to remove and reapply the cells.
"Our results suggest that this vaccine is very promising", said Jay Berzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof. Berzowski said that HER2 causes the development of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
To extract the immune cells of patients and to direct them to detect cancer cells is useful in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Following his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA Hat denounced Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't work out.
After Kanye West's excellent performance, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would form his government in 2020, she denounced him in the studio during Saturday Night Live.
After her third song, Ghost Town, in which she wore the Make America Great Cap, she denounced the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"So, I often talk to white people and they say, 'What makes you like Trump, they're racist?'
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's sketch, in which the Hollywood star mocked the case of Brett Kavanaugh, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already investigating allegations of sexual assault made against her by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It was not disclosed whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that she was threatened with going to the backstage with her headwear.
"They threatened me backstage.
He said, 'You don't go there wearing that hat.'
They threatened me!
He also said that I was stuck in the wrong place, according to the Washington Examiner.
"Do you want to see the wrong place?" West said. Also, he said, "They're going to make a play for my Superman Cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Love. 
In his comments, he mentioned the audience at least twice and was perceived as embarrassing by the SNL cast, a separate report told the publication: "The whole studio was completely silent".
West was called in due to a delay in arrival of singer Ariana Grande, who had died a few days earlier, as well as former Ariana Grande's boyfriended rapper Mac Miller.
West surprised many by performing the song I Love It, dressed as a perrier bottle.
West again met Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: Thank you for raising your voice for the public".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just there "what she told me and what is absolutely amazing".
"But I did not choose a person who would benefit (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I believe promotes a false idea for my community or misrepresents my community.
He's free.
That is why we exist", he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, adding that he was just "formally going to be known as Kanye West".
They are not the first artists to change their name, but Diddie and Puffy had done so before, with their old names being Puff Diddie and P Diddie respectively.
With him, the rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly known as Snoop Lion and the late Prince of Music also changed his name to Symbol and after that the artist was already known as Prince.
A knife-wielding assassination attempt was made at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder, suspected of stabbing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defence is expected to be presented to the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The Game of Thrones star, Keith Harington, has questioned toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his swordfighting role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such roles on screen often inspires many young boys and they feel that such hard work is necessary to gain respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was feeling 'something is wrong' and asked how to eliminate the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Keith married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, who believes she feels 'strong enough' to talk about the issue.
He said, "Personally, I think very strongly that right now, are we doing something wrong with masculinity?
Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems they see on screen?'
Kit thinks television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, and he thanked the very masculine character for that.
He added: 'What happens and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, makes young boys believe that they must do certain things to be a man?
I think it's really become one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
For it is obvious that something is wrong with the young men 's thoughts.'
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series returns at the end of next summer, he will not be participating in any of its prequels or sequels, and he also said that he has 'made a lot of programs with battlefields and horse riding'.
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's new series True West, which tells the story of a film producer whose brother is a bandit.
Recently, the actor said that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
"This show has given me my life partner, so I believe this show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here".
Rose has played Yeggit, the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married in Leslie, Scotland, with family consent.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, new cases in China have increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
Health officials have reported that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given recent changes, most new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officials said that the number of people suffering from HIV through this medium had fallen to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission by sex by the LGBT community in China is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but the LGBT community is reported to be highly discriminated against.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women due to the country's conservative values.
Due to the many infections of the disease, these relationships have insufficient protection from sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, promising everyone that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that his staff had leaked GOP senator data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and "a plot device".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters called the charges unfortunate on Saturday, saying that one of his employees posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by a "ultra-right wing" scholar and website.
Waters tweeted, "Lies, lies and too much hate".
The information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information, which was seen online on Thursday posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, came as Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak of information from three senators was questioning Kavanaugh.
Hill says that conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have identified IP addresses that identify the source of the person posting, and that the source was linked to Waters' office and that a Waters employee had released the information.
Waters said, "This accusation is completely unfounded, false and utterly false.
"No one of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security is being compromised by these false and false allegations - was in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This accusation is unfounded, completely false and utterly false.
Waters soon posted online for a cleanup of criticism, including the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger.
"It shows that his temperament is not as a member of Congress should be.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not do so in anger.
They should not become rebels.
They should not question the person who has accused.
They should be calm and patient.
It seemed that Fletcher Waters' response was being compared to the condemnation of the Democrats in Kavanaugh, which critics accused of being very angry at during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also shared his thoughts on Twitter for defeating Waters in the midterm elections.
He tweeted, "If this is true, it is a big deal".
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement units to these allegations of fraud.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are informed, and that they are legally held accountable for all the actions they have committed that are very bad and dangerous to any and all of my employees", he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - The spy act by Rowan Atkinson was not considered very effective.
From a British perspective, the importance of Brexit is still seen traditionally in any new film and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise that began with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be self - exaggerating on how we certainly take nonsense to talk about the nation's new export opportunity?
Johnny English, who has a pop-oriented and rubber-faced personality at any rate, has his license to recreate the bassoons - which is far more famous than anything else - than his name alone, a widespread comic creation for areas where non-English speakers live.
They are certainly the Daft Secret agent who managed to show off Mr Bean's Dash Clousoe a little bit more than anything despite his quirky appearance in Smooth Glamour and a dollop for the chap who contributed a single note to the fire theme tune charity at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
They are basically travelers and International Man of Mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclays TV commercials was forgotten except for Wake's Chaos.
In this new JE outing, you only see one or two good scenes.
I loved Johnny English, which showed him going into a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and wrapping a rotor blade on his helmet.
Making physical comedy on screen is a gift to Atkinson, but the laughs were very low and a strange half-life, especially as "best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves with full confidence as a comedy component.
Laughter sounds like a comedy not for adults but for children, and the strange misunderstandings of Johnny English are not at all tolerable to me, and I prefer Bean to Atkinson's silent film.
The always relevant thing is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
Britain's most secretive spy network has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, with the network identifying all UK operatives who could affect the agent's work - a tragic event for Kevin Aldone.
This is the final resort for the brilliant and very troubled Prime Minister, who is already struggling with a number of political and unpopularity problems: this Quasi-Theresa-Me character can be played well by Emma Thompson, but the script is not very strong to work on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every employee who has made a deal with a spy will have to bring someone who has retired.
This meant that Johnny English, now a schoolmaster at a Push Institute, would have to fight himself, but he would have to work outside the record on what an undercover operative should be like: he had some good comedy, and he had to teach English at a rock-type academy school by a spy.
English has been sent back to the Emergency White Hall for briefing and Ben Miller's reprise has been combined with his very old gallbladder - sore sideburns.
Now that Boff is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is as a jockey-stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has not been able to freeze.
So, in His Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin make some very big mistakes when they face Olga Cruelenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ofelia Bulatova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of being confronted by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to have a solution to Britain's computer crises: the villain Jason Volta played Jake Lacey.
English and Bugg begin their odyssey of the Furious High-Jink: they set fire to a French restaurant while working as waiters; they smuggle through an expensive Volta boat; and English activates complete chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to use the interior of Volta's house.
The film is certainly shot everywhere for that last sequence, but it is still neat and entertaining, with lots of fun for children throughout the film.
Pretty much a medium.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English films, I couldn't figure out whether or not Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that was truly his talent.
Labour has denied that it plans to work for the British people only four days a week, but the money will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a democratic plan where UK residents are only required to work four days a week - but pay for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company owners to give a share of the savings from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee three days of leave a week - but they will still be able to get the same salary.
Sources say that such an idea will be 'big' with the party's economic agenda and it is planned to benefit the country's workers.
The Trades Union Congress is promoting a four day shift a week to help workers take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take four days of work week, which is in line with the overall industrial strategy of the Party as well as the Party's vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers.'
While the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, Labour will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not the policy of the Party and is not being considered by the Party.'
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell said that he firmly intended to restore power to utility firms from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteurs'.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back as the Labour government can 'cut' based on alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plan to create an inclusive ownership fund to incorporate employees into the boards of the company and to assign 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanagh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanagh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelle asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if there was any chance the FBI would find something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more white than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanagh on the way to the hearing.
After that, when the charges came out, I called them, asked, 'Did you do this?'
They were sure, firm, clear".
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be a stone 's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavana and it would have required an explosive charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blaisey Ford.
"And whatever they named, he could not verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual concert featuring many of the most influential stars to perform, and equally influential is its mission; to end the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the program to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the global poverty project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get free tickets for the event: to help the concertgoers become volunteers to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty, to complete "activities" in a number of ways such as emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways.
But how successful has Global Citizens been in the next 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to persuade people to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "clique activism" - people feeling that they are really making a difference by signing online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing forward efforts towards various goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion set to affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements generated by its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that the SafeFund has so far directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers, which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, promising to "help children grow to their full potential".
During a live concert in London in April 2018, Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ulman told the crowd, "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history".
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional intervention.
In response to a frequently asked question on their website, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monay are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to "unblock" Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Citing the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zincke revealed that Washington could "recourse to the U.S. Navy if necessary" to block Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zincke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - specifically, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
He reportedly said that "I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern region of Europe, Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinka was addressing attendees at an event organized by a nonprofit group, the Consumers Energy Alliance, which calls itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran to the fact that they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as a "move-by-move" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "The economic option for Iran and Russia is, at least, to take advantage of and replace fuel".
Statements are coming that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, which has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity from 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers".
The American stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dietter Kemf, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I get very upset when a big state interferes with our energy supply.
The Massachusetts senator said Elizabeth Warren would "seriously consider" running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During the Town Hall in Holyock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and connect our broken government and that includes having a woman at the top".
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
"They are taking this county in the wrong direction", Warren said, assessing President Donald Trump during the town hall.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy", he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court candidate have been vocal in criticizing Brett Kavanagh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to get the FBI checked out before the vote".
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most Warren constituents do not think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, eighteen percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said a senator should not run for office.
Thirty - three percent supported running in this way.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Devlal Patrick's bid, with 38 percent supporting potential participation in the election race and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed for potential 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD of Palin at a rally by Donald Trump.
Track Pauline, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in a domestic violence incident.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she told the audience, "I feel sorry for the way my son is feeling after he returns, for the other families who feel the effects of PTSD and know the wounds our soldiers come back with".
Pauline called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They return with a little change, they return with a tough attitude, they return wondering if it is honor for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, have sacrificed for the country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang-run or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a Justice-Friendly Summary in Washington on Friday in support of a refugee challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff 's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said that her companions "and the sons of members of her violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, generating large numbers of applicants for American refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Reisen said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a block violates that principle", said Justice-Mitra.
The attorney further argued in the brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry would harm the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give shelter to victims of domestic abuse and mass violence in June.
In its policy announcement on June 11, Sessions said, "Asylum is available for those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear of persecution or membership of a particular social group because of their race, religion, nationality or membership".
Refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people around the world face every day.
The rescue efforts in Palau have been heightened as the number of deaths in the search for survivors has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It sounds extremely stressful", said 35-year-old mother Reza Kusuma, comforting a fever-stricken child in the evacuation center of Tahas-Nas Palou.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their desolate homes, picking up sunken goods, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals were flooded in the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some wounded, including Dwy Harris, who were facing broken back and shoulders, rested outside the Palau Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the constant strong earthquake shaking.
Tears filled his eyes as he felt the violent earthquake shaking in his fifth floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed in the ruins of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "threatening" through "advertising"
A week after a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper by the government Chinese newspaper, citing the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections - referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, which China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters was a new stage in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which had backed Trump's Republican Party, earlier.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, the top exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branssted expressed his opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, writing that China "is now doubling the amount of bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press".
"In its propaganda, by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and free journalism", Branssted wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the Beijing street newsstand, you will find limited discontent voices and no true reflection of the disagreements that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic curve", he wrote.
He said that "one of China's leading newspapers avoided making excuses for publishing his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
With Kavanagh's defeat, Republicans are isolating women voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
As Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanagh, who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, is supporting and defending him, the analyst has warned that he will see a response during the upcoming medieval elections, especially from women.
The sentiment around it is very strong, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
You can't go back to those things", Grant Reehr, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reehr said he doubts that last-minute pressure by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither the next day nor November", said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with Kavanagh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters protesting in the Senate floor chanted "November is Coming!" Mick reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to drop off the charts", said Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, to the news site.
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it can be more, especially among suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't vote often when they don't like the president".
In a detailed description of Ford's allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had already said that if Republicans move forward with confirmation, it is likely to be contested.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, "It's become a confusing mess for the GOP".
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the bench seating of Kavanagh, it's also about how Republicans have handled it and how they have treated them", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an organization that helps Democrats in the election, told the News Channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in light of the testimony of Ford and Cavanagh, most of whom seem to favor Cavanagh.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony to be certain or likely, while 35 percent said they believed in certain or likely Kavanagh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Kavanagh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford and at least one other individual, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanagh beat her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he joined a party while attending Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet, as opposed to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access what information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the intent behind Inrupt is to gain "world dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data stores" or PODs.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and business tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change, where all their business models will be completely wiped out overnight.
"We do not ask permission from them".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee Net has been an influential voice in the neutrality debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vaughn: WW1 Victoria Cross Clerk was celebrated
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during the First World War celebrated 100 years in his home town.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vaughn won the award in the attack on 29 September 1918 at Belenglis and Lehighcourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two ships at a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughn, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the scroll was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion "among a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield" at the Canal de Saint-Quentin.
Later he moved to the firing line and with "great bravery", led the military line and drove three troops before taking up field guns alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vaughn was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said that his grandfather's achievements "had some that I know I can never match, but we are very proud of".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughn also made their debut after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he was "very honoured to play a role in the parade" and said "the support provided by many people is demonstrating the heroism of a real hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Belater 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you stayed up all night watching the blasted Belater 206 but missed the main event.
San Jose Bill had 13 contests, including six on the main card and was being shown live all night on UK Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gagard Moussaci and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the UK was shocked to see the coverage turn into a peppa pig.
Some were particularly disappointed after staying up until the early morning hours for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
Asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellater, said, "This material was not suitable for 6am under government regulations, so they had to switch to children's programming".
"Peppa the Pig", yes.
Scott Cocker, President of Bellater, said they are going to work on their schedule to engage UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about Replay, I think we might be able to find a solution", said Cocker.
"But it will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change happened, there was a lot of text flowing and not all of it was compatible.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five matches instead of six, as we usually do, and when we tried to deliver more to the fans, it got a little bit too much.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daly felt 'lack of sexuality'
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that his sexuality made him obsessed with being inferior to everyone - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn't realize until he was in secondary school that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she talks about gay rights to give others "hope".
She also said that when she became a father she was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The long - running show's regular presenter, Kirsty Young has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a socially conscious person at Laverne's first event, Daley said she felt "lower" than anyone else because "liking boys and girls was socially unacceptable".
She said: "Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are real things that have given me the strength and the power to be able to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "special", he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said that he spoke openly because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than her, but she said age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age", he said - he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - "it was hard to find a peer who went through the ups and downs of such a young age".
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "total outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are many things more than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not admit that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was if he had London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't be sitting in the front row, Dad".
He said: "I took their hand when they were breathing and held them until their breath ceased and they died, and I came to know that they were not defeated".
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of my hometown crowd at the Olympic Games - was the best feeling", she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Proud by Heather Small - which was echoed with him during the preparation for the Olympics and which still makes his roundabouts stand.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to prevent it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the 12th time for a record, Mickelson was sidelined for Saturday's Foerballs and Foersham by captain Jim Furyk.
Rather than becoming a center of attraction, as he often remains for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day living among the cheerleaders and working in the hope of improving the flaws of his playing style.
Never driving straight at the peak of his career, the 48 - year - old was not a perfect fit for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where long - active non - active drivers are regularly punished by false shots.
And whereas the course is not so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American players who start four points down in 12 singles starts strong, Mickelson's game can prove to be quite important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role, patted my back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He is funny, he is sarcastic, he is responsive, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special", he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives more than just playing".
Captain Thomas Byrne of Europe knows that the great edge may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from his experience that a large lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup singles can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his debut in a 1997 match at Valdera, where a side under Seve Ballestiros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win, with the lowest margin, had just reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valdera; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valdera, we just won", Byrne said, thinking after seeing the class of 2018 lead 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that it is not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn 't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus is to stay.
I always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players in the world are on the other side".
Bjorn went on to say about how his players performed on the tough golf course: "I will never be able to outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow, personal demonstrations will come forward, and that is a different matter.
It's great to go out there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out there in person, your ability as a golfer is tested.
This is the message you need to convey to the players to show their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he has to do his best".
Unlike Björn, opposite Jim Furyk would have been eager to do better for his players personally than he did as a partner, with the exception of Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas, who scored three of the four points.
Before facing defeat for Europe's "miracle in Medina", as part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furyk himself has been on both ends of the great reversal of the last days".
"I remember every word of it", he said when asked how Captain Ben Cran Shaw handled his players on his last day in 1999.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to get off to a fast start like you did in Brooklyn, like you did in Medina.
When this speed is one-way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set our lineup up and engaged people like this, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do something else miraculous tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counterattack with Rory McClureau in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I grouped them in this order because I think it covers them all", Björn said of his solo selections.
The new German warship was again postponed.
New warships of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the period-affected Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly increasing costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", the flagship of the all-new Baden-Württemberg-class battleships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be delivered as a replacement for the time-dependent Bremen-class battleships.
It is understood that they will provide an array of powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continuous delay means that state-of-the-art warships - which could provide Germany with an opportunity to power projects abroad - will be out of date by the time they enter service, Di Zinn commented.
The Durdant F125 battleship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Bloem and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Few people knew the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited several significant "software and hardware defects" that rendered warships useless when deployed on war missions.
The software shortcomings were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half the manpower of the older Bremen-class battleships.
Furthermore, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonne "Rhineland - Pfalz" is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the value tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have risen from an initial €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problem of new warships, which have become particularly important in light of recent warnings, is stifling Germany 's naval strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was indeed "deploying out of ships".
The official said that the issue has become more serious over time, as the old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were made available.
He said that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research being conducted at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use natural landscapes in their prey for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland, will follow the common and soprano pipistrels as well as the brown long-eared and dormant Dobenton bats in the Inverway Gardens of Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
All recording experts sound analysis to determine the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
The natural habitat will then be mapped and reported to illustrate their behaviour on a detailed scenario scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of natural habitat management activities such as the creation of grassland and how to maintain the woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect bird nesting and damage natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also pose a threat.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to point out flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists who regularly survey, inspect and sometimes rescue bird nesting sites.
The organisation has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Three Estates of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the best place for him.
"Here in Thrive we have a good area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there is still much unknown about bats, so what we do here and in other properties will help us understand what they need to breed".
They emphasize the importance of bat checks before maintenance within properties as it is possible that the destruction of the maternity ward unintentionally could destroy 400 females and infants, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their nest.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and we still don't know how many of our species are growing", he said.
Ronaldo denied the rape claims while lawyers sued the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" saying people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer is going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus Forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in a live Instagram video after reporting the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today is fake news", the five - time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to make themselves known by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but that's part of their job.
I am a happy person and everything is fine", the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for those charges, according to Reuters, which he called "suspiciously invalid reporting in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that players "will seek compensation for moral damages in an amount consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" disappointed him.
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was mutual consent for this.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and even took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "panic by retaliation" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34 - year - old says that she is now trying to break the agreement as her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and signed a €100 million deal with Italian giant Jue this summer.
Brexit: UK will 'regret forever' for losing its manufacturer
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "regret forever" if it lost its position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU it would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnsstone near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event of no deal Brexit, the delay in border crossing could affect jobs.
The Barnstone Plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Barnstone, said, "I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory".
Other UK carmakers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreeing on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the supply chain risk in the event of no deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with made-to-order car parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry, which could lead to delays and spare parts shortages.
The company said that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory of more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be discontinued.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Chechers plan for future relations with the European Union is "purely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that I think can not only enjoy success at the moment, but also what is necessary to get this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota but other manufacturers have provided evidence that we should be able to fully continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to jobs being lost.
Peter Sauvalleries, who has worked at Barnstone for 24 years and is the union coordinator at the plant, said that his members are extremely concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go away, they never come back to the bed afterwards.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union".
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for "another week" as Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanagh's struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump's aide and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and threatening Mueller's freedom, the news has warmed the Washington market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiring to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refuted the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" the removal of Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanagh and the woman accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weeklong FBI investigation into claims against Kavanagh, delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date for this is not set, it may be this week, I can see that the subject matter of all other cases pending with the Supreme Court can be pushed back another week.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not due to the TV reporters' interest in "glory", although he said: "I do not disagree with the fact that they are magnificent".
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any other president", he said, not citing evidence, "we have seen those numbers".
The briefing will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me".
We're trying hard to do that, and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, he's going to take the place of the press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated a cheeky and often unique presence in front of the press, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS Scotland writes to EU workers about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and wishing them to remain in the post-Brexit world.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months into the process of withdrawing the UK from the EU.
The Scottish Government is committed to covering the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its deprived public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, moving towards decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also moving forward with its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know that this must have been a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from the European Union and beyond bring together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee Mike Organ reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who suffered a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came ashore and just fell there", said Reed.
The instructors and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on the stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdrombie has emerged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details on the type/limit of injury are available as of yet" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He scored a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18.
High stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a high stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This move will undo the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
A high stamp duty rate on purchases of property in the UK from foreign buyers is being prepared - additional cash to be used to help the homeless will be announced today by Theresa May.
The move is seen as an attempt to derail the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, which has attracted young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target higher earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms not paying taxes in the UK, with additional funds to boost the government's campaign to deal with those who fall asleep in unusual circumstances.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including two houses started two years ago and rental purchases, can be a maximum of three per cent.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first time buyers to get their feet on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts with the intention of helping more young people build their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of boosting property prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to leave a quota on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr. Corbin has announced a compelling series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and an end to "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more power to the councils for building new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our fragmented housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-UK residents as it is for foreign-based companies to buy a home as it is for hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is far from being realized, and the desire for gold in extreme circumstances is very real".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
Scott, 42, is repeating the challenge of reviving the North East club, currently in third place in League One, and three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father from childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in managing the club".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canio.
The former Aloha Athletic boss says he felt no panic following established names at such a big club who had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's initiative.
"For me, success can be predicted by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League".
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'll probably see myself as a success here if I can get the club there".
After spending 15 months as assistant boss of Dumberton and on the coaching staff of Hearts, Ross' managerial career has spanned just three years.
He then helped Alloa to recover from a third tier relegation, and replaced Saint-Myrén with a championship title winners' relegation next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
In the case of Aloa's inauguration, he said, "It was probably a real crossroads".
"I really believed that management was more fit for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I did the right thing, earned the right money, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and it makes me feel most comfortable in my entire adult life".

The best time for a pint is Saturday at 5.30 pm, the survey found.
The summer heat has boosted Britain 's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but the restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiles the statistics, said: "In July, the sunshine and England's expected participation in the World Cup mean that a similar pattern followed in the month of June last year, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants faced even more difficulties.
The decline in restaurant trade in June was 1.8 per cent and the decline in July was worse.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol performed stronger with more likes than the restaurants.
Food-powered pubs also suffered from sun damage, though not dramatically like restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks in all pubs and bars for the month increased by 6.6%, while the sales of food decreased by 3%.'
Paul Newman, Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since late April.
The impact of the weather and major social or sporting events makes it the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a year-on-year drop of 4.8 percent in sales, especially due to current cost pressures, will be painful.
The long summer season could not be a bad time for food operators and time will tell if the higher moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide much needed relief".
Total sales in pubs and restaurants including new openers in July were up 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slow pace in brand roll-out.
Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups performing industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - some of them younger than 11 - has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some of whom are younger than 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean "main" account to show their parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who suddenly looked at her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager was urging others to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It is very disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Elith Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elith Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland 's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty called the move a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from their extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
"Eliath has a great deal of respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community", said Betty, "and we are confident that bringing athletics to Scotland will benefit them greatly".
"I am looking forward to being the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland", said Doyle.
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the American and now regular BBC pundit who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta were unable to walk after a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell whether I will recover and to what extent I can be.
It was a tremendous task, but I learned to fully recover, walk again and exercise agility today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Comparison of mothers to cows by breast pump advertising caused a difference in opinion among online people
A breast pump company split opinions online by an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to milk from cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company Elvie released a new humorous music video-inspired ad that gives mothers freedom to express themselves.
In a grassed cow barn, four real mothers dance to a song that includes some of the following: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't thongs, these are my breasts".
The chorus continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Them Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies".
Whatever the case, the ad, which has been posted on the firm's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it lightly portrays the "terror" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
They need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk just like we do, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of giving birth", one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits intuitively inside the nursing bra.
Another comment: "Of course, it is painful for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their children?"
Another added: "What an irrelevant advertisement".
Others defended the ad, one of whom said that she found the song "humorous".
"I think this is a great idea.
I would have had this, too, if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that it is a great product".
Another commented: "This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and experience "gay".
This is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they were dancing with carefully pumping their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the LV pump is well hidden, has no wires or tubes and fits directly into a nursing bra carefully, giving women the freedom to walk around, hold their children and even go outside without pumping.
Ana Balerin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product, deserving of a blast and a fantastic launch.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, displaying a sense of freedom in an entertaining and relevant way that will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time that the LvPump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two using the product appeared to catwalk for designer Marta Jakuboski.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border.
Trapped migrant children were spying on even when there was relatively no change in monthly border crossing, partly because the rigid curvature and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hire children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had hired undocumented migrants and they feared that they would risk their own ability to stay in the country by claiming any child.
The threat was further compounded in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, presented evidence to Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors house live in the country illegally and the maximum number of them are criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals", Mr. Albanes said.
Demanding early preparation of the children, the authorities introduced new rules requiring children to appear in court within a month of their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the staff who took refuge.
Many people appear via video conference call rather than present their case in person to a immigrant judge for legal standing.
Those who are deemed unfit to be released are immediately expelled.
The longer the children remain in captivity, the more likely they are to remain bathed or depressed, which can be demonstrated in violent impulses or attempts to escape, according to the protection staff and the system's reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said that cases are taken to a higher facility like Tornillo, where the sign that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
He also said that taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to friends would only increase the shock they are already struggling with.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'lem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country is now in its eighth year of war.
Ma'allam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally living on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly".
"They should withdraw from the war zone immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Maullam stressed that the war in Syria is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this "extraordinary war until we both clear all terrorist groups and all Syrian areas of "alien presence".
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, primarily training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the war - ravaged country.
On the refugee issue, Maullam said the conditions were right for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of needlessness", which prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They were politicizing a completely human issue".
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be received for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provides an opportunity to press further on political dialogue, the United States politician says.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people lived.
However, Ma'allam said the agreement had a "clear deadline" and also hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaeda affiliated with Nusra Front, who would be "deleted".
United States Representative Staffan Di Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution to soon pave the way for Syria and elections.
Ma'allam set certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which states that the panel's work should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warn against interference.
Why will Trump win a second term?
With that argument, Mr Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberal or elite individuals are expecting any impeachment and scandal to end his term prematurely.

Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has averaged over 1.7 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers, with the nightly news featuring the mainstream.

The disorder had a value in entertainment.
And, of course, beyond TV and stuff, stories coming out of Washington could shape the future of Roe V. Wade, the unification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged viewers could risk being unheard.
And yet, it's beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself watching a six-hour panel of experts debate, using Woodward's "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", the implications of Paul Manafort's $15,000 bomb jacket (a thick cloth with a hat) and Stormy Daniel's epic description of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario like that again.

The race for the Election House was flooded with external money in a strong middle position.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash on the 17th, credited with rebuilding the Congress chamber, leading to two incumbents running for the same seat.
Which recently opened the door for the suburban Pittsburgh district's Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamp was also in the race for a second term, Republican Kath Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which is interspersed with the new 17th.
Following this ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutional fraud in favor of Republicans by the old districts, the maps or maps were recreated.
The economic impact of the campaign was touched by the empty handed battle between the major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) in the new 17th race.
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania 's 18th Congressional District.
That is why the seat had been held by Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits provoked the democrats a little more.
The US punishes El Salvador for supporting China, then backs down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a passionate meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Heather North said in a statement that "on the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", State Department officials decided to recall US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was fined, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and financial aid.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow the same rally or mass as last year, which was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end considering any sanctions or fines for El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative spots into the conference.
And three Americans from Washington quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh message or punishment.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three US officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and also talks on condition of anonymity.
History of study
The next case could be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on possible resistance to Mr Trump's justice, of which there is now ample evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also changes the direction of his investigation, according to the report, if Mr. Trump's campaign is to make alliances with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body, when he prepares himself to go to the voters again and perhaps to a jury of his colleagues.
I mean a lot of ifs and ifs and I don't mean to suggest that the downfall of Mr Trump or his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.

We failed, which resulted in us missing the opportunity to stop so many years of genocide.
The mechanism of historical centers around such divisive points and the unimaginable march of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenthin, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what will we do?
Rosentine has been in this mess ever since, since this paper reported it last year, he suggested keeping a secret record of the president and considering his ineligibility for office.
Mr. Rosentine said that The Times account is not accurate.
"If the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kwangoe is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite the evidentiary allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we react?
And beyond that, will we vote for Congress in the midterm, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I think that because of the lesson I learned in Prague, we will not fail.

Graham Doran's Rangers are optimistic even after the intense Vienna clash.
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, winning the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dudan from making his first appearance in the season to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because the Villarians were good", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get it, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results in their last game with the crowd or the crowd behind us, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made to the club itself, last year was certainly difficult but now there is a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully, we can now move on from our last session and be successful".

Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it with their family members.
More than half of the individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate", said Holly Cinder, Vice President of Life Insurance Business across the country.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to care if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you suggestions on how to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a healthcare proxy so you can hire a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider the right of an attorney to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer their questions about medications and allergies?
Provide that information in a written plan so that you are prepared.

A man fired several rounds into the air in Lafracomb.
A man was shot several times with a wind rifle while he was walking home at night.
The 40-year-old victim, Lafracomb, was in the Oxford Grove area of Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials describe the shooting of BST at around 02:30 am as an "accidental event".
The victim could not see his assailant.
His wounds were not so deep that the police appealed to him to become a witness.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further.
When communications were shut down, rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongla Regency, the northern region of Palau, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Dongala, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, on the shores of a narrow bay.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a beach resort in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, extending over 300 kilometres (180 mi).
Regency has an estimated population of 299 below the administrative province, up from 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morovaly on the opposite shores of Mahak Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, the tsunami has struck Palau and Dongala several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire seismically and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the western coast of Ak province, Indonesia, in North Sumatra caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, half of them in Ak.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes also hit the western shores of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude tsunami hit Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that exploded off the southern coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake near the city of Padang affected the region which is the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Mentawai Island off the coast of Sumatra affected the area, causing dozens of villages to be destroyed and about 300 people killed in a tsunami in the area up to 10 meters.
2016: A deep-water earthquake in AK struck Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and disaster as it brought people to remember the devastation or disaster of the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from collapsing buildings or buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok devastated everything, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, eastern Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for assaulting.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman acquainted with a person tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he would take the phone away from her.
According to KTUU's report, Palin was sent back to the Maut-Su Pretrial facility and also fined an unsecured bond of $500.
The network reported that he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for the plea.
Palin faced three Class A felonies, which could carry a sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor with a one - day jail term and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had punched her in the face.
After linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after earthquakes struck on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the coming days, the mortality rate was rising and electricity and communication networks were not working.
The earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, a north eastern region of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There were videos circulating on social media showing the impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered in the city of Palo for the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect in the NYC attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a rare death sentence for Saffulo Saypov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment given in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saypov, 30, allegedly used a home depot-chartered truck to attack pedestrians and cyclists on a roadway down the westbound highway in Manhattan in October.
According to the intent to seek the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Cypov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" injured them physically".
Both countries potentially impose the death penalty according to court documents.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury framed Sipov for 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors, especially in organized crime cases and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the invasion required "sufficient planning and prior deliberation", explaining the manner in which Sipov carried it out in a "hatredful, cruel and vicious" manner.
"Saffulo Habibulavić Saipov injured and damaged the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves Enlar Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Eliezer, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagunco", the opinion is stated in the notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death penalty case in the Southern District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Brain was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
John Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, had no grief or remorse for days and months after the invasion.
Police said he told investigators that he liked everything he did.
Saypov told the authorities that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS videos of crime on his phone.
Police said he also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He requested not to be guilty of the crime of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that our decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only postpone the psychological trauma of these events to include everyone", Patton said.
Saypov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farrah should be made the incumbent for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz swore to 'gather an army of people' during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Ukip leader asked politicians to 'understand the environment' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that she should negotiate with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that if Mr Faraz had been Brexit Secretary, Britain would have been 'outside' by now.
But the challenges faced by Mrs May in addressing her highly divided rank have been underscored by pro-Rimen Tories to combine a different protest against Brexit in the city.
Prime Minister Brexit, Reminiscence and the EU are struggling to keep track of his checkered compromise plan during the attacks.
The allies insisted that she would try to reach a compromise with Brussels rather than backlash - and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said that to leave means to leave the rally in Solihill, where he wants to 'throw the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' she said.
The MP or MP from Wellingborough said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the Checkers out.'
Setting up its opposition in the European Union, he said: 'We do not need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone rejected all suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins was also present in March saying: 'I am just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our activists who actually blockade the streets and elect us first.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Mrs. Ma, he said: The Prime Minister maintains his jobs when he does not break his promise.
Shri Faraz said that rally leaders should be 'realized' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
He said that this is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we are here to tell them 'we will not let you run away by doing this.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit by understanding the environment.
'We are organizing the army of the people of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remeners march from Birmingham before rallying for two hours in the city centre.
A group of activists pointed to Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis pretends to be talking about security issues with the party app at the opening of the conference.
'It is these people who tell us that they may have the right IT system and all the technology for Canada, unresisted border and unreserved free trade in Ireland.

There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a 'hard line' on the president's operations
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, Massachusetts Democrats or Democrats spoke about their future during a town hall in western Massachusetts.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren is running for re-election in the GOP state of prestigious Geoff DeHalle Number, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was speculation about her being able to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoak was Trump 's 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since taking office.
One of the attendees asked if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go and fix our broken government and include women first".
LSU was arrested in the death of Sim.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11:00 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sim, 20, was shot dead near the campus of the University of the South on Friday morning.
"Police Chief Murphy G. Paul told 247 Sport on Saturday that "Wed Sim died from a gunshot wound to the head".
Wade went on to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
When Simpson was questioned, he admitted to killing Wade Sim with a gun there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the Police Department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
A 6-by-6-foot junior who grew up with Betten's disease, Sim played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton eliminated the world title after the team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment on it became clear that Valterie Botas was eligible to play a major role in Saturday's Louis Hamilton Mercedes team order race.
From the pole, Botas made a good start and knocked out Hamilton as he made his place in the first two laps and invited Vettel to obstruct his team's drivers.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton in the back of the pack, something that should be decisive.
The Mercedes was a lap behind and came out from behind the wheel but Hamilton pulled out after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly defending the third corner leaving without risk after a double-movement.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and by his 21st birthday was seventh on reaching the end of the first lap.
He then moved on to a large part of the race, focusing on changing his tyres, and quickly overtook Kimi Rakonen in fourth place.
He finally got into the pit on lap 44 but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight laps when Reckonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valterie did a great job all weekend and is a truly great gentleman.
The team did well, getting one - two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad mood.
President Donald Trump on Saturday faked Senator Dean Feinstein at his request, failing to leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford's statement directly to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying that people are "meaningful and bad and dishonest".
"One of the very good things that could happen in the past few days in the Senate, when you see angry, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people", he said.
"When you see the release and the leak and then they say, "Hey, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied it had been leaked from the office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he said".
But the president did not find his refusal justified, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "I tell you, it was really very bad mood.
He may not have done so, but I have rarely seen such a bad temper before".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said the Democrats were using the charges on their behalf.
"They are determined to withdraw power by any necessary means.
You see their meanings, their dirt and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they run after to get power or power or control", the Ombudsman reported the President's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday to make up for the loss of the Elite League on Friday against Belfast Giants.
The Giants initially gained a two - round lead through attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beaulier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crown took the home side level before reinstalling Dyer before the Giants' lead.
Francois Boschard tied it for the dummy before Lucas Lundwalt Nelson secured the win by two goals.
It was the third elite defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's man, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning their last three games, this was the fourth meeting of the season on the sidelines.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Candle McFaul, with David Rutherford helping Beaulier to double the lead in the next four minutes.
In the busy early period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before matching up with Cooney's at 15:16 for Matt Merquadrat.
Doyer ensures that the Giants make the lead in the first break until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side is reclassified and Boschard once again takes them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nelson lead the Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and he secured victory in his team's fifth halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who had lost their last five games so far, are now set to play their next game on Friday at home ground Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controllers were hit to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero or hero since he died ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could land safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake triggered a tsunami on Sulawesi island on Friday.
The aftermath of the shock continued to devastate the area and many people were trapped in the rubble in the city of Palo.
But while his associates were running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Egang refused to leave his post at the busy controlled post at Mutiara Sisi Al Jaffari Airport, Palau Airport.
He was stationed there to ensure that the flight 6321 of the Batic Air, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower, when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirtret said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Climton to take them to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached the flank.
"Our hearts were broken by their departure", she said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll from the destruction of the country could reach thousands, the shorting agency says access to Dongla, Sigi and Botonsh is limited.
"The death rate may still increase because many bodies may still be crushed in debris or rubble, or in many places that cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Nughroho.
Waves rising to six meters destroyed the palace, causing a mass burial on Sunday.
The army and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Reza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances came with bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets were looted everywhere".
International Red Cross head Jan Galfand told CNN: "Indonesia is racing to help Red Cross organisms, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In Indonesia, the first earthquake in Lobonc earlier this year killed about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nugini now reports that a man has been missing since the Lagun plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Makronesia now says one man is missing after 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air New Guinea said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it is working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for incomplete information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane sank while attempting to land at the airport of Def Island, local boats helped to rescue other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which it occurred is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say that both planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jane said the plane had fallen very low.
"This is a very good thing", Jane said.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of deep water by an emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew were panicking and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that the sailors working nearby to improve the strait also helped rescue by using a wind boat to bring people ashore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of PNG-registered airline over the past two decades but no one was involved in Air New Guinea.
The analyst described the time of night when the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors resumed their case on Saturday to retrial a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
She told the jury how she used cellphone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she obtained location data from multiple cell phones, which shows that the deadly evening was with Tallis Chambers, denying her previous claims, The Clarion-Laser reported.
When the data shows that he was with his friend Michelle Sanford when he said he was with his cell phone at the time, the police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville".
The second discrepancy was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chamber's death, Tallis removed all texts or messages, calls or contact information from the Chamber from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is ready to begin its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected to go to the jury for the hearing of the case that day.
High breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based High Breed claimed that hip-hop has drifted from its roots to address political messages and social issues.
They wanted to move away from their roots and reawaken popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fugees and Common saw a recent revival in Britain through artists like Alaka and Loki.
The other black person?!
NY Nanny sues the couple after firing after a "racial" text.
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased targeting after a mother complains that she is "the other black person" who texted her.
Couples deny that they are racist, suing for "abduction".
Lynsey Placebo-Flaxman, mother of two, expresses her frustration with newborn caregiver Gisele Morris, who was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"No other black person", Mrs. Placebo Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Placebo-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that her estranged nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Uber after paying for her one day's work.
Now, Morris demands a dismissal from the couple and compensation of $350 a day for six months, but the Live-in gig hired her to start work without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do any of that", he said in a post on Friday, explaining, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple claimed to be racist, stating that they could not trust him after insulting him, it was justified to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people", the husband, Joe Plazko, told the Post.
But can you give your children to someone you have ever insulted, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let it go".
Like the "abduction" case, Placebo said that his wife had only two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going after someone like that?
It is not right to do this", the investment banker said.
While the legal trial is still ongoing, the couple has been quickly blamed on social media, silencing them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddyston publishers fear that the reader will not associate it with their own thoughts and opinions, the new paper reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkins, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It is difficult to imagine anyone holding their own when reading it for the first time before it is published.
It's amazing to know about Pendington's success".
Recounting his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, was optimistic about the rejection of his work, he said that after his death there were both "joy and grief" on the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of her family", she says that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a calm man and was not arrogant at all", she said.
"But because Pendington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a kid who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it.
I think that's how they saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his imagination and composition, he always credited it to Paddington".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors was in vain.
"Nade was regularly saying that it was really bad, that he didn't expect that", Mrs. Adnan-Laproux said.
"Then Nad called me and told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine doctors had given him to beat his heart was gradually ending up leaving his system.
She would have died a short time ago and it would have been over.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all about to end.
I could not scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to take care of them all".
Mrs. Adnan-Laproux, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, eventually boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"No one knows", he said.
"I bowed my head and wept all the time.
It was hard to express, but I saw the extreme feeling of compassion for Ned on the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Postcards of victims to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Callie Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages that people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew her for her smile.
They always said that her smile could shine everywhere".
Although he had quit his job before he died and was living in a "very dark room".
In 2014, Tyler's brother who was looking for his missing brother or sister at the time, aged 11, committed suicide.
"I was constantly worried that there would be a cumulative impact", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis created cards to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark shortly after her mother died.
"She didn't say anything that made her feel sad or sad or anything else", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we will make some changes in her behavior.
He was so sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he couldn't see them".
She said that her death was a great shock to her, but she had to get out of it: "It tore the family apart from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight back".

When the FBI began investigating, Kavanaugh's future was in doubt.
"I thought, if I could really find something he was looking for - a limited time and limited scope of investigation - maybe we could bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee among the alleged biased gridlock was "breaking up".
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance was due to time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, the Republicans perform very poorly, so they will be severely weakened in their efforts to win what they wanted in the High Court on the ground.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, promotes him to support Mr. Kuan Gua, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate will have a vote, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kuangua could have received at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, Vice President, had to end by and confirm in the Supreme Court.
North Korean fugitives 'fallen' by Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea declined when John-won came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the Ministry of Integration of the South, Park Baiyong-Siyog said that 1,127 people have left their duty last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
The strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and tax evasion were the main factors, he said.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
A large number of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum number of Chinese fled was China, whose border with North Korea is the longest and the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas is easy to cross.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back to their countries.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on blocked nuclear negotiations.
It was activated in June following a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed on the terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yang-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to unilaterally harm ourselves first", Mr. Roy said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "funny", saying he was not qualified for the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "funny" and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't think of a woman who could even do such a performance, they call it 'funny,' Pelosi said Thursday in his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blessy Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He clearly punished the Democrats on the committee, proving false allegations of "strange and coordinated character secrecy" by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he thinks Kavanaugh's witnesses have proven that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court, as it shows that he is acting against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi expressed suspicion that when asked if Kavanaugh becomes permanent and if Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, she would still blame Kavanaugh.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but he can work right now because he's invited", Pelosi said.
Kavanagua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rules against the affordable care of Act or Ro V Wade, as he is known for his conservative justice.
In his certification submission, Kavanagua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"In his confirmation hearing, Kavanagua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
And women need to move it.
It is a religious insult, months and years of anger goes out and she cannot stop herself from crying.
Mrs. Stemin told me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry".
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She said, "A woman who helped me a lot was an officer who said that she cries when she gets angry, too, but she developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she'll say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry".
And then she kept talking.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed to flow out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my earliest memories of a job, a male headquarters, is when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, finding an old woman holding my neck from behind - a sharp manager I had always been a little scared of - who had dragged me down the stairs.
He said, "Never cry in front of anyone".
"They don't know how angry you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to meet them".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressional woman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught making a relationship other than marriage in a boat or a name called Monkey Business and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was extremely disappointed, decided to run for president herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have time to raise funds and so she vowed not to participate in the race until she had raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave the men $1,000 would give him only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she could not control her emotions - gratitude for those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds, and frustration with even targeted voters rather than representatives and anger at sexism - she fell to her knees.
"You must have thought I would have a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to her.
"You may have thought that Clenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my grave?
"She cried"?""
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvos of the US-China trade war were slowing down and while the war is still far from over, the rifts between countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was issued earlier this year by imposing a major sugar export tax on solar panels, steel and aluminum.
With new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (£150 billion), the most significant increase this week is effectively taxing more than half of all goods imported from China into the US.
Beijing has responded in its own way every time, most recently by slapping tariffs of five to 10 percent of the $60 billion in US goods.
China has promised to match America shot-to-shot and the world's second largest economy is likely to collapse soon.
Getting Washington back means to hollow out demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing can move forward, the US trade war can positively support China in the long run while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that either initiate economic tailspin in the country is actually even more dangerous than what the audience has seen before", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center of the new America Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Ma'ullam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made against terrorism", he said.
The Government continues to resettle in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'lum said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six straight times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When the Danish captain Thomas Jørn's teens reach the 14.5 points needed to beat the Americans, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at the 3rd 16th hole by accepting a match from Francisco Molinari.
Italian golfer Mollinari won all his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Speith was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjon Oleson of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Dawson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Lane Polter, who had probably played his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win the tournament every time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm so glad I could help", Gracia said emotionally after winning Europe.
He torch his partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Wood 2 - 1 in single play on Sunday.
"I am extremely proud to have defeated Tiger Wood, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicholas.
The US team struggled all weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finneau, who played golf with full caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furke said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I am proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played a great game.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and I'll move forward with Thomas.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You should greet them.
We played better".
Red tide update: Pinellas, Manete and Sarasota have low concentrations
News reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission show a general decline in red tide concentrations for part of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, conditions of pasteur bloom were reported in areas of Pinellas, Manete, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting decreasing concentrations.
The Red Tide extends about 130 miles along the coastline from the northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Patches can be found about 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but on fewer sites than last week.
Red Tide can also be seen in Pasco County.
Last week moderate concentrations were reported in or offshore Pinellas County, minimum concentrations in Hillsborough County, higher concentrations from the background in Manette County, higher concentrations from the background in off-shore Sarasota County, moderate concentrations from the background in Charlotte County, higher concentrations from the background in the off-shore area of Lee County and lower concentrations in Collier County.
Breathing outbreaks are reported continuously in Penilus, Manete, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory outbreak counties were reported in northwest Florida last week.
