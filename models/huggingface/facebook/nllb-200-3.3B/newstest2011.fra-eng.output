The SSC doesn't know Voldemort or any pastry shop in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the mayor of the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, to see if they knew the argot that was born in the last years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who ruled in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political creme of Prague put in place during the previous era of mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected members did not understand the familiar terms very well.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I'm a young man in Prague politics", said Lukas Kaucky, the culture-elected candidate in the "godfather" vocabulary test.
And as for the veteran politician, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
Like the meaning of "golf hole".
"That's the only word you suggest I use".
Otherwise, I don't use the slang.
From the vocabulary, which the daily Aktualne.cz published in June this year before the pre-election congress of the ODS, the editorial team chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the patisserie", "beef nerve", "treason against the capital" and "spoil".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then didn't pick up the phone.
The fifth candidate, Petr Dolinek, flatly refused the test.
"I am not concerned at all with such things and how representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I will not give my opinion".
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other in our programmes", he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend, that this is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" didn't say anything to Kauk, and the only expression he guessed in the test was "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", said Kaucky, adding immediately, "but I know it from the papers".
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course", he joked.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he means "go to the bakery".
"It is, I think, to go to a company", Plachy is ready to guess that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In the same tone Brezina reminds us that he gets his knowledge from newspapers rather than from any vocabulary he might use.
According to the test takers there is no lexicon of arguments in social democracy.
"I have consulted with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have anything of the sort".
"We say names instead, sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols", says Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that", admits Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the Party members or at least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the sponsoring of the party, is nicknamed "the little playboy".
The only nicknames that Social Democrats are willing to use within the party are nicknames.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda much, but Akutel.cz daily has registered another nickname for this Prague president.
The Court of Justice has also held that the law of the Member State concerned is not applicable to the case of a national of another Member State.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women who are declared witches have common traits.
They are part of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are single and have no children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man has very rarely this destiny".
"Young women in good health are not judged either because they are working and giving birth", says a sister who works in the capital of the West African country of Burkina Faso, in a special institution for more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He's published a pamphlet that should help curb the witch hunts.
There's a hiccup in the case.
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso cannot read", warned the newspaper Die Standard of the drawbacks of written instruction.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they sprayed on her.
The BBC server transmitted this information.
The criminals claim it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointing caught fire when the woman touched it.
The oil was ignited, it was said, when the team tried to "banish the evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all educational levels.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The soul-eaters have always been a danger".
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce the witch hunts, Gambia has seen the President himself involved in them as recently as last year.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a large witch hunt which, it seems, may have participated in his death and tried by black magic to kill the President as well".
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue and brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the President's personal guard, men and women chosen at random from Gambian villages", Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm, the prisoners were made to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
International pressure led to the release of about a thousand people.
The tenant of Bakal: The heat is on, he signed a higher rent.
A large elderly man walked out the door of the customer centre of the RPG Byty company of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter's and his son's, who is currently serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay 4100 crowns for a 2+1 apartment of the second category from next year.
"And there's no hot water and the heating runs on solid fuel", points to the new contract from his son the man who has the signing power.
"But I signed anyway", he said, angry and half resigned.
The citizens' association of apartments BytyOKD.cz which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published explaining the method to follow to claim.
But the man responds to this by a hand gesture.
"One says this, the other says that", he frowns.
The Ostrava region is becoming the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 am.
Right next to the door is a security guard from a security company with a device to call customers.
A special "Hire 2011" button is on the touch screen.
One tap and a piece of paper with a number on it comes out of the machine.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number already starts to light up on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a split second, it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrive to inquire about the rent, but the new rent doesn't seem to apply to the people in the waiting room.
Most people came to deal with the usual problems of the day - claims for repairs, insurance incidents and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people in more than 44000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with the new lease contracts in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special ticket office for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still a trial", the cashier answers after a moment of hesitation, when the customer introduces himself as a journalist.
The de-mining and former miners' apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local issue.
The Social Democrats' deputy speaker of parliament Lubomir Zaoralek from the Ostrava region made a rather strong statement before the elections and it is now filling the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change a fucking board in the bathroom", the man said.
However, according to the employees, it is mainly pensioners who come to make sure that they will receive a refund on the new rent if they sign now as promised by RPG in a special offer.
It's a half-rent rebate for other tenants who sign their new lease before December 15th.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is not really overwhelmed by questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent", says the clerk at the counter.
Yet RPG is still offering individual rent interviews on its website and in its storefronts when needed.
If the two parties cannot agree on the rent, an independent tribunal will decide.
'This is not about threats but only about informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,' RPG says on its website.
"No one here will go to court" thought one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the customer center agreed with her.
"I have 13,000 crowns in pension and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court", he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We will see".
"Mr Zaoralek in the media asked that no one sign and so people wait", she said.
The rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund", recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest 4 billion in apartments with the rent, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered chairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information shown in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31200 apartments, i.e. more than 90 percent of the RPG apartments.'
"And it will always be at most 7.50 CZK per m2 per month", the screen says.
The 38 percent increase is for only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a very low amount of 19.66 CZK per m2", adds RPG.
Next year, the rent will be the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical increase but a gradual one over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increases (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings on heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices of the architects.
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch. Design company.
No one would have expected it to also house a mini-kindergarten with everything needed - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural design firm Arch Design, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has been designing its mini-enterprise nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, mostly of childbearing age and it was important to her that the women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
Along with parttime employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to employees by Arch Design as part of its social programme.
This gives builders and architects the opportunity to combine demanding work with care for children.
The idea for this nursery school was conceived by Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-nursery is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
With the financial allocations (CZK 2.8 million) they were able to buy equipment and apparatus and after two years to provide qualified staff and start-up.
After the use of the financing allowance (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to run the mini-nursery school on its own funds.
The project took a year to prepare and it was the Economy rating company that helped to apply for funding.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, with a nurse and a kindergarten teacher on duty all day. Children can attend kindergarten without age limit, but most are over three years old.
As it is a "mini-kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who change.
The school is flexible in its functioning according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchical position.
Although the programme is individual care and education, the mini-kindergarten is similar to the pre-school programme.
The children do not just play but also receive quality education - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that the children can use.
The presence of young children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can monitor their child at any time and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children at a school far from the parents' place of work.
So parents are using their work time in the most productive way.
It is no wonder that a natural relationship of loyalty develops between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.is thus listed among the companies that offer a preferential bonus for the recruitment of new employees and which are family-friendly and through this programme strengthens the marketing of HR.
The house of bones still fascinates after 100 years.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase a dinosaur spine, and the balconies open fish mouths.
This is the case of the Casa Battlo in Barcelona, designed by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house was given the nickname "Bone House" by the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade resembling scales and curves everywhere - these are all the epic features of Antoni Gaudí's Art Nouveau.
The front facade of the house has its dreamlike lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
A closer look reveals the precise geometry, rhythm and order of the work.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit up in such a way that the impression of brilliance of the colors is enhanced.
The winding and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood is used in the form of waves for window frames, balustrades, door decorations, and for the eyes and slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district in the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of a house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house with multiple dwellings was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the façade also worked other artists and designers.
The joint work on the plans for the Casa Battlo house began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the hot house right after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the house that squeaks".
They say that on top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi designed a unique central heating system for the house, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the building directives of that time and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, the members of the city council were not pleased that the pillars of the building were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's appeal, Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a common living room and on the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story house is divided by a staircase that leads up to an independent roof terrace.
All the right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common area can be completely connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the upper class can communicate comfortably or else limit the private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction received in addition to new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, with the blue and white glass tiles that decorate the inner courtyard and the chandeliers.
The two-color scheme gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo, which was inscribed in 2005 on the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits because they found that it was a profitable business and they expanded the visits to the common areas and the attic including the roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders get 20 percent off.
The sum is still above the entrance fee to the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a companion among the building's inhabitants and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bedside table: women have different criteria than men.
Not a flashy frame, but rather the quality of the bed surface, so the mattress and the bed frame provide a real base for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement each other harmoniously to please a particular user.
During the selection several factors are decisive:the weight, height, age, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the door frame are to be placed is also important.
Typical example?
For example, in a country house where there is no continuous sleeping, latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" slowly.
They are also heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
They need to be turned over frequently.
If they also do not have sufficient ventilation channels in the core and if they are also on a solid board, they retain moisture.
Habit is also a factor in the choice.
A person who spends his time abroad where very thick mattresses with a soft coating are frequently used will hardly feel comfortable on a low, hard surface.
"That's how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can't sleep there".
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a soothing layer of lazy foam".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes or have a nervous system disorder, which makes it difficult for them to receive information from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Adamczikova, a specialist in upholstered furniture.
That is why the lazy foam mattress has been so popular with hockey players and other customers for some years.
"Today everything is working well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex and also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing presses you and you don't turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against the spores.
To choose a mattress for your height, add the length of the feet, which is about 21/34 cm.
So a man and a woman who are both 6'2" tall need a bed that is 6'2" tall.
The minimum width for each bed for a two-seater should be 90 cm, or 180 cm in all.
For single beds, single beds for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It's convenient for visitors.
'However, there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should place your hands comfortably with your elbows slightly bent.' Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Mattress-Builders and Decorators, who has been working for several years on the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches this in specialised schools.
For a double bed each person needs his own bedside and mattress, so be careful when buying to choose the mattress height.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the bed frame at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
The minimum height of foam mattresses should be 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, and the minimum height of the form and airing layer should be 3 cm.
"When you touch or sit on the mattress, you must not feel the springs", warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of mattress.
The summer bed, when the mattress and the bed frame are joined like Siamese sisters, has no place in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are very badly worn; they must not be washed, which is commonly done nowadays.
And since during the night we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
So experts refuse to advertise a 25-year life span for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all to his but.
And here is a tip from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, do not use a mattress cover, hygiene or washing, but use a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture coatings with zipper for the whole assembly, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for the large models (and for only one person) becomes a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
You have a hard board in your bed instead of a bed frame?
I never will!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no such) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with bag springs (German Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position flange mattresses with 14/18 flanges, latex or sandwich mattresses (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut) are ideal, but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more than 28 flanges and above, where the flanges are folded in the lower part of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate the stiffness.
For multi-position mattresses, do not use a spring mattress as it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the rigidity adjustment of the blades, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special bonding of the lamellae that allows the lamellae to be pressed or tilted so that the sleeper's shoulder "integrates" well.
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back", this is a very important thing.
This is already being considered by mattress manufacturers who have begun to use a shoulder-softening area for the "male" mattresses.
But they also think about women - they offer them a softer surface in the hips again.
For the most demanding customer there are winged or padded caps with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and the tension decreases.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and inflated) on a good mattress and mattress, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder pad of the headboard or the softened area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones made of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
The petroleum-based raw materials from which polyurethane is produced are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio label for the mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products", explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coverings, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can add microcapsules that develop scents of the forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the birch plant extract for the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cooling" the man, the coatings "warm" the woman.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
What are your current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of the cold molds gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has taken the top spot.
Saving for mattresses and bedspreads is not easy.
Special promotions from manufacturers or producers may occasionally be available for two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn into the cover for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can get the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness began with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
It started as a matter for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to the start of enormous load factors.
Temperature melts in the heat and hardens in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimum pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal for sleeping disorders and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or similar type.
Tracking devices are increasingly being requested by parents who wish to monitor their children.
Fear for their child has more and more people thinking about monitoring their child through a GPS.
The system, originally designed to track cars, can also be used to track people's movements and help in some cases, such as the case of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently the size of a matchbox but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has moved many people and they have started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy", says Petr Pilin from the company MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit there may be instances of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of someone who is unaware, but I have not yet encountered such instances".
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons", Pilin adds.
He said that children should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bockova points out that if a child does not want to wear such a thing, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to purposely getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control.'
"Cell phones, which can cut themselves off like these tracking devices, have already made parents wait a long time", says Bockova.
She said that the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
"If it's a planned kidnapping, the perpetrator will make sure the child doesn't have an electronic device that can locate him".
"Actually, it's the phone".
"As soon as tracking devices are developed, they (criminals) will also go looking for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign".
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in the case of unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
'The apparatus may be so configured that it is in regular operation after a specified period.'
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains".
'The more expensive devices also have a tiltmeter that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is found lying motionless,' says Cech.
He believes that smartphones equipped with a navigation system can offer a similar service after formatting it with a special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that they are either a device similar to those that are worn on pendants the size of a matchbox or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the Macro Weil company, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device".
"Or he will find out after a while, which will give the police a little more time", he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or a pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of positioning systems using GPS (commonly used in car navigation) and a feature in a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has enough blasting cord to circle the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought 274 miles of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Department of Defense purchased 224 kilometers of it.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the strings is two to four years at most.
The army bought some detonator cords from the STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as a reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cord MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of the reserve to be held by the army's pyrotechnicians, with whom the Ministry of National Security and Emergency Situations has been in contact, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an annual exercise in explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At that distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the Army reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, at least 2 m of detonating cord is sufficient, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, soldiers from the rapid response brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that the shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy such a large quantity of detonating cord from us".
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing".
"For us the army is a good customer that we as merchants strive to satisfy", says STV Group's Commercial Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of detonating cord means that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports that the detonating cord has a lifetime of only four years, and that the police and military pyrotechnicians have a lifetime of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it can go up to four years", says one of the two who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
After the shelf life is over, each round must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a quantity discount for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km", says the spokesman Pejsek who interprets the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to allow more flexible use of more modern and more reliable types of detonating cord.
The defence ministry is now having great difficulty in neutralising tens of tonnes of munitions from the Warsaw Pact era when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to move across the Rhine.
The Czech army, which MF DNES has contacted, is expected to be able to neutralize hundreds of kilometres of old detonating ropes, which it is now buying "for cheap", in a few years.
To this day I benefit from the contacts I have made through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the prize for the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of last year's Individual Entrepreneur competition was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His journey to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun was a traveler.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacked a quality accommodation facility at a reasonable price.
With his savings from what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
This was a courageous move, since he was still a student in his 30th year of graduate school.
"The quality of accommodation in our area and the price made me want to do something", says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profits in the building, which he converted into a 54-bed guesthouse.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of these was until very recently the four star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another one of the same quality arrived.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise have shown up", the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the win in the entrepreneur of the year competition has served well", Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me, and I must say, it was very pleasant", he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to all who strive to do something.
It's not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be seen is good.
He says that he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"I started to have regular business contacts with those I met through the contest.
He said the fame of the success had an impact on the employees as well.
And he's about 70.
"What I see in them is loyalty and pride in having committed themselves to something that has been generally recognized".
"This is not, and far from, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
"Only my name is being pushed forward", Lucas Pytloun modestly said.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's sense of purpose Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The person who came to Slovansky Dum to collect the prize for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodafone last year was Karel Zdarsky, the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury awarded him for his efforts to turn a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million kroner.
'I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but also my colleagues and has increased our confidence to fight the competition,' says the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after, they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company became known even to the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers really start to know the Farmet brand better but also the foreign partners who started to realise that they were working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its home country", says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year was not just a year of victory in Farmet.
The valuation of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for selling engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We obviously didn't escape this situation".
"Turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off workers", explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they have managed the situation correctly and have maintained profitable results even if they were lower than they were before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We built a training and research centre with the endowments, strengthened the company's presence in international exhibitions and won top awards at national exhibitions", says Zdarsky.
All the evidence points to the crisis being behind them.
Business numbers are up and with them the number of employees.
"I wish the new winner this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere", says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is now part of the business clan for the fourth time.
Some of the absurd regulations have been removed.
The unfortunate winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the requirement to bring documents into the offices that civil servants can get online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social services administration required a paper extract from the trade register, whereas the official could obtain it with a few clicks of the mouse.
The investigation changes that.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the extract from the trade register for the control of insurance payments", said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs have to comply with in the Czech Republic and to delete those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
Last year 3,000 voters demonstrated, this year at least 4,000 have voted.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and,this, more and more.
"We may be the number one tax filing nation in the world", says Karel Havlicek of the Czech Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
The situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all compared with the rest of the world.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for enterprise, 8 places higher than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first launched in 2006 and continues every year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September each year, the last time before the competition closes.
The organiser of the competition then chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that receives the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last inquiry last year, there were about 100 or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees which had lost their meaning.
The comments are sent by the employers but also by the trade unions and the teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees, is the obligation for motorway and highway maintenance vehicles to pay tolls, or for contractors with twenty employees to repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November on the Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Czech Republic, and Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts a bridle on the entrepreneurs' legs and for this my aim is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the business,' declared Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to repeal absurd decrees is not a blow in the water.
In 2007, what people didn't like was the requirement for entrepreneurs to declare three days before to the office for the individual enterprise at the place where the enterprise is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This requirement was removed with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a business trip for a foreign employee for 30 days, was abolished with the text of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is fine until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year - the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Environmental, humanitarian, training and sports projects are assessed.
The new feature of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been running for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support reasonable and fair enterprise.
"We want to support companies that monitor the environmental impact of their business and are socially responsible", says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator Vodaphone, which is the sponsor and promoter of the contest, as well as the contest for the Rebel of the Year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 Firm competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that are not successful with a single long-term objective for the company have registered.
The adventures of each of them are rich in inspiration and an independent article would be worth editing.
Although the object of their enterprise is different from each other, their support and planning activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns disabled people and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Czech software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of its employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund for 17 years, which sponsors disabled children.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70% of the workforce, has been awarded the title of the responsible firm for the Central Bohemian region and has been awarded third place in the region in the firm of the year competition organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won by introducing flexible working hours and even reducing the average working week to 35 hours, without a corresponding reduction in wages.
The jury awarded the prize to the company because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports local businesses in the surrounding area and is concerned about the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment", explains Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit in the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages them to work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation which helps the local Romani community", says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
At the very bottom is a Karlovy Vary region washing and cleaning company, which also participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, upskilling and recreation", says Joseph Strapac of the bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists in Vodafone's Firm of the Year competition who had completed the questionnaire attached to the registration document and had sent it back to the organiser by 15 August were automatically entered in the category of Responsible Company.
The organiser removed wrong or incomplete answers from the questionnaire.
"If the representatives of the competing firms did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the competition for the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the 'main' competition for Vodafone's firm of the year".
"Independent entries are not possible as this is a subcategory of the main Firm of the Year competition", explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
Detectives have handcuffed local contractor and real estate developer G. Lubos.
The applicant sought to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a claim for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific applicant.
The latter was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for insider's crime in the framework of a public tender and competition". Antonie Zelena, the head of the Plzen Prosecutor's Office, told Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
How he could influence a public competition is a matter of speculation, given the paucity of official information.
Asked about Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Land Fund, Lubomira Cerna, said that the police actually arrested a man in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a customer and not an employee", she said.
The public tender according to Cerna has the real name "Call for Proposals for Land Transfer Rights under the Land Act" and is set up when several candidates for rights are presented.
"These persons are offering, in the context of the call, a higher value of their restitution rights which must be settled before the land value is announced".
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the purchasers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has proposed the highest rights", explained the Fund spokesman.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the call and, as he himself was also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to the candidates on the ground not to participate in the competition.
And he probably paid for it by retiring.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Fonds des Terres).
He was involved in the case of former FdT leader Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for having edited land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been issued.
Mr Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public roads, specifically at the place where the access road to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the city hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is much higher.
The city council was forced to accept because otherwise it would risk jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional 100 crowns per month for accommodation.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to withdraw from their wallets up to 100 kronen a month more than now.
Electricity goes up 4.6 percent, gas up almost 2 percent, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity consumption for apartment households is expected to be around 100 kroner more per year than at present.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices in view of the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energies, particularly photovoltaic cells.
Gas increases moderately, but of course at the time when people need it most for heating and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So there is also an additional 100 crowns.
Although electricity and gas prices are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating prices differs from town to town.
The larger municipalities are the ones that plan the price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 krona more per month for central heating from January onwards, while families in Liberec will pay over 1000 krona per year.
For the people of Prague, a 9 percent increase in water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city raises infrastructure rents.
If the rent is not changed, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
For example, rental prices will rise significantly in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase the number of apartments by up to 100%.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be taken to court by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could rise next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fern, beer is out of fashion and acts very slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and, exceptionally, the best brand of whiskey are stolen from the parents.
These are the drinks that most often bring into the hands of the doctor those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old.
Children who are treated in hospital for a recurrence are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to those in the children's wards of hospitals.
"Beers and wines are out of fashion because it takes time to get drunk".
'The trend is really towards strong alcohols,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the children's department at the hospital in Horovice in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to sneak a bottle of Pop in the cupboard, it's sometimes whiskey but it's fern and vodka that prevail".
"The vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and not smell it", explains the Head of Department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for the Motol hospital, also agrees with him.
"It's usually rum or fern".
"It's all the rage today, especially in elementary schools".
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought from home", added Jurinova.
According to the Head of Department Pélican, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 years old in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice last year, he was at Motol where he practiced for ten years in pediatrics, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the surrounding area completely drunk.
"A girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in her blood plus a mixture of ecstasy", the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Exhibition Park in Holesovice at a party".
"What is interesting is that it did not seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours", said the department head in astonishment.
It is precisely the selflessness of parents or their unusual tolerance of their offspring's drinking that is the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
However, experts say that children are not considered to be addicts in the strict sense.
"The term alcoholic means chronic alcohol dependence for several years with all the associated phenomena, but not found in children".
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is more a matter of a significantly unfavourable socio-family background", explained the Head of Department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or by the police, are not counted.
Besides the cases of children sitting down and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, it arouses three seasonal waves that we can expect, according to Pélikan: Witches' Day, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after a bad grade or they celebrate the start of the holidays".
"Of course I have experienced on the day of the witches an admission of 7 children drunk at one time", emphasized Pélikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in drug rehab under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffered from "wood-fever" the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency are relieved by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have a great night and then a nice wake-up and nothing hurts".
"They are just amazed at where they are", adds Pélikan, knowing that from time to time this spoils the good mood of the patients at least with the bill to pay for their care.
The cost of ambulance transport and hospital admission in an intensive care unit can be tens of thousands of kroner.
"On occasion, I have applied this as a means of education by telling these children how much their drinking has cost them and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay for one night", added Pélikan.
However, he argues that health insurance companies, in their regressive management, which should recover from parents the costs of care, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two L-159 aircraft out of five in all, for which the Ministry of Defense has exchanged Casa C-295M transport planes, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have, however, been abroad for training or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 which were until now in service in the Czech Army and were in flying condition.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of the Vodochody planes is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-seaters planned for the exchange were taken from long-standing aircraft stockpiles without causing additional costs or investment for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The two-seater L-159 T1 was exchanged in the state", said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater as the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two-seaters.
The Army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second due for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft are being purchased by EADS and will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries".
"It is therefore up to the individual to determine how to achieve this", said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defence department argued that the exchange ensures the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech Army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and only used 24 of them, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely have legal implications.
The European Commission has, however, brought a case against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected through a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the last one is due to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index finger than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men with a longer index finger than an annular finger have a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British magazine Cancer.
It may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that relative finger length is a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60", proclaimed study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be screened for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she and her colleagues in Great Britain followed over 1500 prostate cancer patients and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right index finger shorter than the ring finger.
They were found to have the same risk of prostate cancer as the 19 percent of men with the same finger length.
For those with the index finger longer than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 percent; for men under 60 years of age, the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of the study but does not think the link between finger length and cancer is "fully established".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 highways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered with snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, the deblayeurs have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 highway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffered the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Central Club (UAMK) told the news
At the 91st kilometer a truck was hit, at the 93rd two heavy goods vehicles collided, the accident injured people.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometre towards Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at kilometer 190 or go through Brno and then enter at kilometer 182 at Kyvalka.
A line of cars several kilometers long formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there's an accident and it's just on the way to Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
There are car lines in Prosek, for example, and Sterboholska Street is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams are delayed on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the crisis staff of Prague has to meet again.
The railways and the airport also have problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to cancel seven express routes because of the snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems.
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday at 11:00 in the night until 5:00 in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already passable but with increased vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impassable, on the Brno road there are snowfalls in places and on the Blansko road chains are mandatory to pass certain communication roads in the higher places.
The Vyskov region was among the worst affected areas.
So far the routes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them up, we may need to send snow plows and snow shovels.
We can't estimate when they'll be rolling.
On the road to Hodonin, caution is required in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads which are, for the sake of nature protection, maintained only by spraying inert products, there is still a 5 cm layer of snow, warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and 10 centimetres of snow fell; the most fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow cover in the Czech Republic is gradually disappearing.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only by the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a super-accurate cannon
Its projectiles are laser-guided with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly destructive explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target but also at any point along their ballistic trajectory.
So it can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
He's also not protected from above, and when a deadly rain of steel splinters falls on him, it can knock him out of action as well.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier basically uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends a laser beam to it that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise aiming point, according to which he corrects his aiming point and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 yards".
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires at a distance of 1,400 feet [500 m] plus or minus five feet [1,200 m] and three feet [1,200 m]", Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will move to Astro Park from their current workplace in the office building at Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, in July next year the 400-man and women's workplace, which was previously located on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be moved to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term the group would be able to bring together 100 other jobs which are still scattered in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the Astro Park open-air offices were more suited to the way the staff worked.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The general manager, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a key location for us with a remarkable infrastructure".
He claims that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company to the region's interior has caused joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The head of economic affairs for the Frankfurt Municipality, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a 'global player' had been won.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is a good fit for the city and its establishment is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality very early of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this enterprise", Mr Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the building in the Place Marienbader.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
The aim is to ensure that such an exceptional site does not remain unoccupied for too long.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative".
Ten years ago, the building on the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, which was used until now by the Fujitsu company and the "small vertical" next door, and the rest of the buildings on the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project for the spa resort.
A new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall, a joint project between the municipality and a private developer. This attracted a lot of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the surfaces that used to be part of the car park, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory company Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based specialist group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley real estate fund.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group considers itself the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it provides computers and servers for businesses and also provides essential services.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other branches on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
The 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrical Industries.
The server was kicked out by Amazon - Threats against Mr Assange
Wikileaks is having more and more problems.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed from its servers the site that specializes in revealing confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressures that have been brought about by the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks website is under attack with ever-increasing force.
The cyber-activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely in Britain, according to newspaper reports.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server".
"Freedom of expression in the land of freedom", said the cyber-activists behind the revelations via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before that, the cyber company Amazon had removed the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to gain access to the documents.
Wikileaks continues to reveal via Twitter: "Great, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe".
When freedom of speech is a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks from its servers after an investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's associates.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Land Protection had threatened the Amazon site with a boycott, British newspaper The Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this action earlier in view of Wikileaks' previous publications of classified information", the senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"WikiLeaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and reckless manner, and in doing so is endangering our national security and endangering lives around the world", according to a statement from the Independent Senators.
"No responsible corporation, whether U.S. or foreign, should help Wikileaks release the contents of stolen documents".
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to reports in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber activist has consistently called Sweden's prosecution of him a plot orchestrated by his detractors.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange".
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, said Hrafnsson.
Which is also why the WikiLeaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the man responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister's adviser Stephen Harper said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy has broken out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently disclosed order to diplomats to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we should care about the opinion of an individual who owns a website", says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website".
The US government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counterterrorism Center, has been named to be in charge of combating the leaks.
Mr Travers is tasked with implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary by the WikiLeaks leak of diplomatic cables.
The White House is also keen to examine the ways in which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it will provide security for dissidents and activists if they are threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have made every effort to contact them", said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary".
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are made at the best times of the year.
The three-day training course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where'd all the ice come from?
The ice cream truck and the ice machine.
The glacier, or rather old-fashioned ice cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display with a spatula, puts it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cannot help but look at "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbetter manufacturer founded the ice cream university in 2003 to ensure that ice cream from its machines everywhere meets high Italian ideals.
The three-day course for future glaciers was a great success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice cream are also offered over several days, and practical sessions are held in the private ice cream parlor.
In the midst of the midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on the ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, an art education teacher from California, is a big fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to get something unique out of this nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
The key is not only the good flavour, but also the silky softness and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a heck of a dose of romance".
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar, and stabilizers, into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program, and then cools it immediately to four degrees.
Then he opens a tap on the machine and a white pasteurized cream comes out, the basis of all kinds of ice cream.
The trainer is then faced with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of the times.
The person who only mentions ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as guar-seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will eat nothing but ice pellets.
Some variations in the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery section of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and paste.
"all the vendors will try to sell you dozens of flavored ingredients".
"You should just try it, though".
Or in the recipes for fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
The white base mass, when added to eggs, turns into a yellow cream and, when added to cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all the participants in the class have to move on to using the ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
The various kinds of fruit ice cream are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, it is not necessarily better.
Nut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts when it is composed largely of nuts.
The very popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a well-balanced mixture can properly describe the taste of an ice cream", says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use peach purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
You need extra sugar for the lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the charts make the calculations easier.
Ice-making is not as physically demanding as it once was.
It is not just the automatic mass-producing machine that helps.
There is also a machine in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it greasy and brought down to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automation, slight failures are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo is spraying himself with pureed fruit from head to toe, and thus splashing his classmates when the control of the colossal mixer bowl slips from his grasp.
Mr. Luciano said that "such an incident is likely to occur in every classroom: it is only a matter of time".
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has flooded the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have been well informed", said Mr Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
It is reported that the chairman of the EFSA panel on genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are contracted by the ILSI lobby group.
The latter is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of the EFSA test prescriptions for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to Mr Then's criticisms.
The rules drawn up correspond, in paragraphs, to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in substance, is said to be controlled by the authorities in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has reported a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta without conditions or transition period, and in doing so, she changed her mind.
Recently, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal links between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicion both from the German Federal Environment Agency and from MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not accept that there is any conflict of interest.
One opinion is that all reliable data is used, including industry data, as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working for EFSA are not prevented from making contact with this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi), based in the United States.
The body considers itself a neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobbyist.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and without any testing of the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know, for example, what the effects of genetically modified maize are in the field", says Mr Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If you don't look for risks, how can you find them?" Mr Then asks in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
This is why there are still very few researchers who are not linked to companies.
The companies felt that the critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck says that "industry controls security research".
The stone trail
Uli Gsell got some, about 400 kilos in all.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing outside the Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manif.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: By September, the excavators had come and begun demolishing much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was not the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the construction work being stopped.
Broken into 6,000 or 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse paving slab poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor from Ostfildern.
He got hold of a few fragments.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He enthusiastically declares: "A modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly".
He claims that when he was cutting it with a saw, he smelled the cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with that piece yet.
Rocks have time.
So is Uli Gsell.
The tracks of Stuttgart stones lead to a former munitions depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man is a dealer in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill", he said from his office in a hut that was once a guard post.
He said he was insulted and threatened when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that there was nothing he could do to oppose the demolition.
And if it does, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
Around 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallel-epiped weighing on average 80 kilos, whose value ranges between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in the hope of returning it when a reconstruction is made.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half of the trees are still in the forest, and the rest have long been sold.
Garden owners, landscapers, and private owners.
They came from all over and took everything that could fit in the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart stones of scandal have long since been transformed into Mäuerle or the limitations of the grass-bender.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special", Mr. Rongen said.
"there was this political component".
He gets in his four-wheel drive, drives around his vast, 20-acre empire.
He studied law but dropped out, and later studied biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a lover of stones.
He has 40,000 tons in storage.
He's been hoarding treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the world's greatest antiquarian.
He's holding back.
Sandstones are carefully carved and placed on the snow.
"They were once part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden".
"Elbsandstein is yellow and warm", he says enthusiastically.
"My favourite stone".
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a pile of finger: red sandstone, formerly part of the station Karlsruhe.
And so on and so forth.
"Joli and travertine".
The parallelliped was once part of the grandstand at the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the police station, the reddish granite from St. Blasien's Cathedral, the tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a work, what a struggle, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that in the past the stones were hand-carved and moved by simple winches and ox-drawn carts, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be torn apart".
He did not become rich, much less wealthy.
But today the quarry employs 14 people, and there are also stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower, and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding", says the recycler.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved there, too.
Competition of talents to win the highest potential
The counter is bustling.
16 college students are scrambling to buy salmon buns, tomato sauce and white-meal.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk professionally about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen firm.
Today, many companies are not afraid to go head-to-head in the competition to find the best minds and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as far as possible from the amphitheaters before they arrive on the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities don't publish statements about their students' performance, we try to spot outstanding talents in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automobile group showcases its talents.
A young woman from the personnel department shares pens, candies and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the timetable of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the paths to the group's premises.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
He believes that there are mutual benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience".
"As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into their own as collaborators".
According to Mr. Sella, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we are trying to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was more on the professional project", says Mr Selle.
The competition for the new graduates will be much more fierce.
In some sectors, companies can no longer recruit by selecting from a pool of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly qualified workforce.
The graduates from engineering courses are in a particularly good position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40 000 engineering posts remained unfilled in October.
And according to the VDI's forecasts, the engineer vacancy will continue to grow.
Roman Dykta is on a talent hunt for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
He organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will be sending eight promising students next year to tour the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG's branches and learn about the company.
The person who is to participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the cruise race".
"For us, a cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the numbers seem to be in.
"We have kept in touch with all those who took part in a similar action last year".
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and wish to apply to our company soon", he says.
Apart from the direct on-campus training, small and medium-sized enterprises are doing the usual thing by participating in trade fairs where they are brainwashing people.
"We try to reach graduates by attending trade fairs".
"For example, at the solar technology fair", says Ms Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs some 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe is aware of the problem of succession.
Currently, 35 vacancies are open on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacancies at the moment".
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time", he says.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The teachers say that the student has the possibility of completing vocational training or writing his final project at home".
Expensive advertising campaigns are being launched by solar specialists.
That is why the company tries to advertise its products by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this", says Ms Stübe, the head of the staff.
Money is no longer the main factor in finding a job.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other factors.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute produces an annual ranking of German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their satisfaction with their job and its context, and also looks at the employees' conditions.
The head of personnel, Ms Stübe, hopes that this placement will help to raise the company's image among job seekers.
"I think that candidates rely on external evaluations as far as a potential employer is concerned", she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy (DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, that means first of all taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make themselves attractive is through their own employees", he says.
This is called, in the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied employees make the best messengers".
When employees are treated well and identify with the company, they are more likely to advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra", says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, a state in the southeastern United States, in the years to come.
The Washington government has issued a ban A similar ban and thus, has permanently cancelled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is still prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is the reason for this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the wake of the accident, which claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign oil supplies.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating golf rip-off has not been settled.
The British oil company, which faces multibillion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze that was imposed after the rig explosion.
Following this decision, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and stricter safety guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another catastrophe.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing a major reform.
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama announced he would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the Gulf's feed rate will be significantly lower than it has been to date.
"The government's aim is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector", according to a current survey of the sector by the BDO audit firm, ahead of the drilling ban announced Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance bemoans the uncertainty of the industry: "No one knows what exactly will change with the regulations".
Investment in new support projects was postponed to a later date, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is oiled brown and emits a smell similar to that of the gas station: Billions of gallons of crude oil have been spilled in the Ogoni country of Nigeria.
The men live off theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't wear yourself out", the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: "You are still enough oil sludge in front of the water lens today".
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man up to his chest in muddy water, as well as the fat tail around him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the sparkle of rainbow-colored water.
You can't see that the subsoil is filled with brown layers of crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo Jetty River, Esther Badom says that she once collected whole buckets of shrimp here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have dried up completely.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil leaked from an oil pipeline that exploded into the vast swamp.
Fishermen from the nearby small town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach the fish-rich waters: Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The whole expanse of the ravine is visible when one walks through the mangrove swamps that are crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits a brown, cloudy water, and any hand that dips into it is washed away by oil.
The roots of the mangrove's young emerge from the ground like licorice sticks, and the isolated palm trees leave their palms hanging sadly.
The search for clouds of birds, as is common in wetlands, is in vain. As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls over this once-paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment", says Mr. Celestine Akpobari, sadly. "Our lives are characterized by a constant danger to health".
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been a battlefield under siege for decades: over 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed; in 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the company is forbidden to return to the Ogoni country: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily through more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred yards, steel trunks stand in the water like bizarre sculptures. The heads of drilling holes are affectionately called "Christmas trees".
They're up to 50 years old, most of them eaten away by corrosion to the point of obliteration.
Akpobari estimates that a wellhead of this nature breaks into pieces from time to time, as a steady stream of crude oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that over two billion liters of oil have been spilled into the ecosystem in the past 50 years - the equivalent of the oil that was spilled into the sea during the Exxon Valdez oil spill 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the worst environmental disasters in human history.
The answer to this question divides the actors.
Shell says that sabotage and pipeline leaks are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, while environmentalists say that exploding drillheads and leaking pipelines are the main causes.
In 2008, US researcher Richard Steiner blamed Shell for applying much lower safety standards in Nigeria than elsewhere in the world: only the failure rate of pipelines is "still much higher than anywhere else".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, from a distance, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of shells and set out in the open: Some are completely naked and covered in shells up to the neck.
A sparkling fire under one of the many barrels which are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without pattern on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline enters a tank through pipes, then at the end of the pipe, drops of kerosene fall and finally diesel is obtained.
So Michael and his four coworkers produce four 300-liter barrels of Diesel daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira, or about $22 [U.S.].
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell for less than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per litre of diesel: because they get their raw material for free.
The oil is being supplied by the "protectors" who are drilling the oil pipeline network all over the Ogoni country, and according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million liters of crude oil in this way across the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the raw material in temporary storage is illegally purified: the organized crime networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, load the lion's share in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether the environmental catastrophe should be attributed to the subversive activities of the population or to the lax production mode is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refining".
But in the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship with Shell in particular had deteriorated so much that the only thing left to do was to withdraw from the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better".
So Michael is getting nervous.
"It's time for you to get out", says the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers may appear at any time".
If the illegal refiners are caught by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be arrested, but at most they will be bribed.
Even the soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, intend to benefit like all Nigerians from the raw material.
"By all accounts, this damn thing has brought our country down to a very low point", Akpori laments.
Investigators discover design flaws in the A380's engines
The A380 clearly suffers from a major safety problem.
Examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible design flaw that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure".
Qantas Airlines now wants to file a lawsuit against the reactor manufacturer.
In early November, passengers on the Quantas-owned Airbus had apparently had better luck: during the investigation, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the engines of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and warned of a possible design defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracking and leakage at the oil pipe connection, according to a position statement published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to "catastrophic reactor failure".
The concerned reactors are Rolls-Royce-manufactured and equip 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which made an emergency landing in Singapore on 4 November, is among them.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British reactor manufacturer.
The company has filed a complaint with the Australian Federal Court, which has its seat in Sydney, and this gives the company the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas' director, Mr. Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts of the car broke off and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
Rolls-Royce says the ignition of oil is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors worldwide now need to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbo which are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, Quantas Airlines grounded its entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the jet engine on an A380 as a precaution.
The two-story plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country is causing a traffic jam
Almost all of Germany was covered in snow overnight.
The roads are in chaos, trains and planes are stopped.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Due to freezing temperatures, almost the whole of the republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover is up to 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the A7 motorway in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked continuously, but they could not cope with the snow that was accumulating.
In addition, violent storms swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal surges to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snowfall on motorways and federal roads has caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the weather station Meteomedia has announced the violet alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, a foot of fresh snow fell, and strong, cool winds scattered it.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind caused traffic to be disrupted and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there were serious disruptions of rail traffic in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the tracks, trees falling on the tracks, broken catenaries or nails.
In Saxony, the interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to provide blankets, food, and drinks for the 165 passengers on the train.
Snow-winds swept the roads.
The snowfall caused many flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for Standard and Flight Information, some cancellations are already being announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights have already been cancelled at Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is a permanent service.
It is true that the number of passengers stuck at the airport has decreased, but there are still only 400 beds available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life when he collided with a train at a railway crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
The snow-covered roads have led to a similar accident not far from Nuremberg. Here too, a truck was caught at a level crossing because it was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, so the Bayreuth-Nuremberg route was closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car crashed into a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: The snow will still be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in a whirlwind.
But the wind will soon be weakening.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and rapid winds.
It is very cold, though, up to minus 15 degrees Celsius in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank is looking to part company with its emblem: According to newspaper reports, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings at its Frankfurt headquarters.
This building could fetch up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has just redecorated its headquarters: the twin towers in the business district have been upgraded; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their old offices.
The financial group is now apparently seeking to recover the renovation costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper reported, quoting a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give the reasons for the planned sale.
He said 'we are looking at whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them and rent them again later'.
The largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its headquarters shortly afterwards.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for EUR 272 million from the owners of the capital and then rehabilitated them.
The energy-optimization transformations have reportedly cost some 200 million euros.
Of course, a sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, renamed in the meantime "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have been thinking of the buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been recovered because the security situation in the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been inserted into the sinking well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and the subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to go down into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent explosion, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance of survival.
So far the bodies have been unable to be retrieved.
Today, relatives and friends have organized a party to remember the dead.
Thousands of people gathered in the sunshine of Greymouth, on New Zealand's south island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were set up on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, were also included.
Flags were flown at half-mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative party that New Zealand had been holding out hope that the miners would come back to the surface.
"But they never came home".
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he couldn't accept his son's death until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative party.
South African and British miners were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have begun to extinguish a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Police Chief Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film a fake movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", an epic of the warrior.
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he made Walhalla Rising?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) is captured; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural strength, eliminates his opponents one by one. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal assassination methods. When he is in a bad mood, he rips out the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, the man does not say a word about his real name until the end of the film, and even the other characters let out, at the most, a few horrifying cries of agony at the end of one or two sentences.
Otherwise, we say nothing and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful highland landscape of Scotland that was the backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal if more mature filmmakers had an interest in existentialism and excellent travelling.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of Pusher, his trilogy about the ferocious and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantino, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and experimental cinema.
Most art film enthusiasts must be horrified by the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
Action film buffs are bored to death when the Borgne embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity in the stillness and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
This is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, is hidden behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It's not about dialogue in this film, nor is it about coherent action, it's all about ambiance, a fever dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment's respite and slowly cuts his throat with chilling images and a bleak soundtrack, but mostly with an elusive hatred that springs from the characters' hearts.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the borgne, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the narrow-minded hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any moment to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil's messenger himself.
It represents rot, but maybe also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, that has the goal of excitement, enthusiasm and wonder.
It was a traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a nuclear programme being developed by Syria.
But the country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of September 5th to September 6th, 2007 at around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is situated on the banks of the Euphrates, and the nearest major city is Dair as-Sur, some 20 miles [30 km] away.
His name appears in the IAEA documents because it refers to the reactor that Syria built apparently with the help of North Korea in a stone parallelogram, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a US intelligence briefing from the CIA in late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, is capable of producing plutonium, which would be used in the making of atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been used since the 1950s.
The CIA has released a video presentation featuring blurry satellite images.
Through computer animation, it showed the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the plant, which is a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she showed photographs of the building nearby, even inside.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into operation, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have hardly any more information than then, and even with time the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and only talk about a "presumed reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, and so does the IAEA.
When asked how he ensures that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a terse answer in the summer, saying that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians certainly hurriedly removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and made a methodical leveling of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former chief inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium at el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers through one Member State showing the immediate aftermath of the attack. These appear to be more telling than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, possibly Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear programme and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site came from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA dismissed that argument after analyzing the particles as implausible.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this issue, as well as the satellite images.
Furthermore, Syria is not allowing inspectors to carry out a second inspection at the Kibar site and is refusing access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel is stubbornly silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this".
The investigation into the case has been dragging on since June 2008 without any result and "is increasingly becoming a serious problem for the credibility of the Agency", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits, and it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA believes that to make progress, the existence of the three other facilities which must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor must be clarified.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are involved here, what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the names of the neighbouring towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly why Syria is refusing access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection team are actually spies who are sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by American secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have been shuttling between the three sites and the stone parallel to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the plants could "serve to produce the fuel".
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is probably powered by unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are at least plausible hypotheses as to the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where would the plutonium later be separated for the bomb.
It is not known whether the debris, which could conceal valuable traces, was stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt have disappeared, no one will have any information about where the debris is stored.
The IAEA believes it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometres from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see whether it could be used for the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently, analyzing satellite photographs for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked the photographs to the reactor in question.
However, satellite images show that Syria had begun excavation work at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began requiring access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it hasn't helped to rule out suspicion.
The IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections in Syria, which would allow the country to preserve any military secrets, and the time involved shows how much interest the inspectors have in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not have been raised in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means carries a huge risk: firstly, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented on it have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "What would it be worth, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in the Time of War
It's been a bad run since Angelina Jolie made her directorial debut last summer.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
In response, some of the filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still going on in Bosnia.
According to reports published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of war victims sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress, who is herself a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
The Commission has already proposed to these women a few weeks ago that they should meet in Hungary, but they have declined.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia", says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script says a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the UN High Commission to remove Angelina Jolie's Goodwill Ambassador status.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his script, gave Sarajevo permission to film after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come later despite this permission.
The young author herself says that she is not pursuing political goals with her film, that it was with a lot of effort that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict.
It is, however, vague as to its content.
So a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet, but it's quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the war started, and they meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serb concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference from the version "a rape victim is in love with her rapist".
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on false information".
Now only the Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace by illegally posting this script online, as many others have before.
Let's fire!
Tonight, things are going well again with the Irish.
No sign of shock.
This is why the local team is overly dominant over the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are shouting for joy amid the loud music, stamping their feet.
The Baileyu-Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is buzzing because players can throw and manage to drop table tennis balls from ten feet away into the opposing team's beer mugs.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong", and the winner gets 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the January beer-pong world championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the secretive computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is looking for a way to have fun, to turn his back on the terrifying question, which will determine the future.
The pleasure of gambling in Las Vegas is not in his plans, and in January he will be conducting job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling, though", he says.
"My homeland is so far away and I have no job there".
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event planner, maybe a good sign" says the young man with a smile.
Due to the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne is a social worker in Sydney, and his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
The young people are leaving: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts at the Institute for Economic and Social Research say that 100,000 Irish people will soon be leaving their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
The economic crisis is, however, affecting the young, well-educated people of Ireland, who have only known happy moments so far.
The loss of employment and social decay seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everybody had a job, there was money to spare.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper has a lot of letters from readers, from young immigrants, complaining: "Everything is going to hell in Ireland".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the opportunity, goes away and our country for a generation".
"Last one to leave, lights out".
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future because the government is only throwing powder in the eyes and offers no prospects for the young people.
"They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs", says the 20-year-old student.
She sees her classmates scrambling from one unpaid internship to another.
She says her biggest worry is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought".
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organises the 'WorkingAbroadExpo' fair which provides comprehensive support on the theme of working abroad.
"But working abroad is a great opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take their first steps up the career ladder", says the manager.
His website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a drag, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was no more work for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will continue to work on other projects in Hannover and Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he is working an extra shift to complete the repayment of the loan he took out to build his home in his homeland.
"It's a bit crazy already", he says as he steps out of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm earning money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore".
He bursts into a shaky laugh as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of big brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for 380,000 euros, financed 100% by credit.
"These were crazy times, no doubt, money was easy", he says.
Is he afraid that everything will collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan pauses, drinks some hot tea, and says: "I have no children to support and am young; even if things go wrong, I can start again".
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears these days.
"No one should go hungry, but our situation is not as dramatic as it was here on the island", he said.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and life in Ireland was just going on".
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
To leave the future behind and find out what life is like elsewhere.
He's already had a few years of work in London on his record, which is why life in New Zealand can't be that easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is one thing that has been worrying him for the last few days: the party he is going to throw for his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might turn into a farewell party.
"Just not a lot of emotion", he said as he took a long gulp of beer.
"A farewell, it seems to be troubling".
"Let's call it a goodbye party, a relaxed gathering of a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games".
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey, taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's survey, which was carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has risen markedly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are committed democrats, which puts the regional average lower (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy in their country was working in practice, the same as last year but a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Graph 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp rise from 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the Americas have experienced only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security system has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Graph 4).
Brazil's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translate into a widely shared sense of progress.
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crime has worsened.
For only the second time since the survey began, more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say that they or a close relative have been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: some 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down from 11% last year).
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela is ranked in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the stricken and fear-ridden country.
Voting boxes were presented and a new ballot was cast, ballot papers were scattered in the gutters, polling stations were ransacked and intimidation was used to intimidate the electorate.
The polling stations were open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, wandered the neighborhood looking for places to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, broke out across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, considers the event as "a pretty good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they did not "believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second tower is expected in January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, rapper Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew from their initial appeal to have the vote declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among the voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and over 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that the turnout would be overwhelming.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards, required to vote, had not been distributed until shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, obviously, the Haitians are doing it themselves.
The tip of the foot towards the centre
In the weeks after becoming a sudden widow, Argentina's Cristina Fernández received a wave of public sympathy that boosted her approval rating by 20 points to over 50%, the highest it has been since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year may depend on whether or not the visibly grieving Ms Fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, by the way, the signs are still confusing.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
It allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has descended into chaos following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissidents in the ruling Peronist movement have joined with Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one lawmaker punched a fellow lawmaker in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is overheating by a large margin: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims put the figure at close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
It refused to deal with the IMF, it harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, for falsifying official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit pay rises next year to 18%.
The economy was boosted by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not paid its 2001 maturity.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among whom kirchnerism is very prominent.
When the Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have returned.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to silently repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half an hour to China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a sort of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters turned out on November 27, or 70% of those eligible, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, in what is considered a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings towards the mainland, having forged groundbreaking business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only by a small margin.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party won three of the five city council seats, he failed to win a majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT's 45%.
If this was a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the city councils.
The event unveiled most of the main themes of Taiwanese elections, including raucous campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
An assassination attempt was also made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted a campaign tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter intended to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates competed with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and resents the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue providing trade facilitation, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back to the fold.
China has wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would also like to see political integration, but let us start at the beginning.
Better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, it was in a bad place: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Ms. Tsai's leadership and the PDP is doing everything it can to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for president, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have a hard time choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do some soul searching.
Mr. Ma's ratings were low; despite a booming economy, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says his office and local branches will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to leading columnist Antonio Chiang, "the point of no return has already passed".
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selection in the "best new artist" category
Perform at the request of a president, and the people are obliged to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises at this year's Grammy Awards with a high-profile nomination in the "best new artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure in the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit of a mystery but is consistent with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; this "establishes the public identity of that artist".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given her slightly engaging vocal style, deft pop and funk hand and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones's meteoric success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters considering jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on the invigorating thrill of a record that was a top favorite last year.
Among these songs, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of the New Orleans crook and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also leans heavily toward a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The steampunk-savage Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned some well-deserved accolades in the big ensemble category; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose octet's live album Pathways was a fine example of the bassist's democratic hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mixture of landscapes by musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses", and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also in the running for an award.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the Classical Producer of the Year featured five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphonies #3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse from Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin from the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoe" by Arthur Sullivan from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers in the running for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for its instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he was writing the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle Eastern sounds and a lot of North African scales and rhythms", Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Orchestra conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination included pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated vocalists-soloists; they are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixes category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording of "Roots: My Life, My Song"
Temecula's mosque project wins approval from the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics have attacked the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center was in compliance with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you name it", said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen".
"This shows that justice has been done".
"The opposition is really minimal", he added.
"They just have very loud voices".
"We have good people in this valley".
The session started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, for the most part, people voting for or against the center, with speaking time roughly evenly distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America", wrote one commenter.
"It's another planet of apes with Miss Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families has coexisted unencumbered in Riverside County for years but she wanted a space bigger and better than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque in Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 acre site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
A microbe that can tolerate arsenic raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, is broadening the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can be grown with either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That's why it's very special, even if it's far from a truly 'strange' life form", said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible", said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life is like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might reveal the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments organisms may be able to use other elements to trigger biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed", commented Professor Charles Cockell of the Institute for Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the search team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure", added Cockell.
It was not a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances might be able to substitute for one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, it is difficult for organisms to distinguish these elements separately".
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, in a way, rubs off the work of our biochemical machine", Anbar explained.
The researchers harvested the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that phosphorus could replace arsenic was not new; but there was never any evidence that it could work.
Arsenic was more common in the early stages of Earth's existence, she says; so researchers have hypothesized that early life forms may have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The last two stolen show dogs were found in Compton.
The other two show dogs from four robberies outside a Bellflower motel have been found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is the dogs are fine", Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape".
"They have been returned to their rightful owners".
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood and under what circumstances.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say", Whitmore said.
"We follow orders".
The dogs' owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional dog shows this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba Long Beach Nationals, where they were supposed to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly month-long dog exhibition tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right by their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6:00 Tuesday.
Peek said they'd offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It's unclear if a reward was given Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, MGM's restructuring is waiting for the final court green light
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan "pre-packaged" by creditors on Thursday that would wipe out about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday's ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there are no longer any legal obstacles for MGM to get back on track under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general managers of what will be a lean studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 from 400 at the outset.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility, intended to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which is itself seeking $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances given that it could not afford to pay the interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the extra $2 billion that the creditors were seeking.
In the spring of this year, it was time to start all over again as the MGM team had begun work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreement and internal debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies received multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collected $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum planned to revive MGM's production, which had only released one film this year, and to put together an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released from 2012 onwards.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio is required to enter into a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
Toys Tech to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top contender for this year's most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's Kinect video game system, both can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99, and that a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic beaded jump ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
Clearly, Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more power; while costing the same if not a little less, compared to last year.
Furthermore, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most popular of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more to offer.
And button-battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some suggestions.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise stated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are plush toys the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when you press on their bellies.
One pressure equals one note, and one second equals a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start to push, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
Drawing inspiration from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do the moon dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complained of a lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the '80s, you'll remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 and up), with a backpack filled with playing cards questionnaire designed to turn a drive into a session with a self-correcting and valve clipboard.
If you're suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3- to 8-year-olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3- to 12-year-olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7 years) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in a line before the time runs out, which is ideal for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more, toys have a sort of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Penguin Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for ages 6 to 12 years) that includes a hidden code-marked coin.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items of their choice.
It could be roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the hair on the end of your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10 for ages 5 and up) is the latest button-powered micro-robot.
The fake beetle is moving rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone sticks in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours has withstood a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary pass in our dog's mouth.
Bringing a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin was walking a city square like a city sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, issuing low-pitched orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of the chengguan - the imposing officers of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of onlookers.
"Stand up straight!"
"Be sharp!"
"Show them", he said, "what pretty girls look like".
Four teenage girls in white gloves, identical olive-colored jackets and trousers, stood on their guard.
Four pairs of black high-heeled shoes, lined up in a row.
Four neatly trimmed hats with hair on the top tied with a blue and white striped knot.
"Personally, I think they have average appearance", said Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are beautiful".
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a college degree.
Guangdong Province has traded in the gray-green uniforms for a blue that is supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the down-eyes with the strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to do a major imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their complexion and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble getting the eye on this underground urban brigade of China.
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portray the news as a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei provincial inspectors beat a local observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing police officers, stolen and posted online, described how to effectively defeat criminals without spilling blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon dealer was left with a brain injury after a brawl with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, shows trained Chinese inspectors raiding street vendors.
"Chengguan has scarred the government", lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "genuinely complete cleansing".
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district passed an announcement in October to recruit eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real jobs or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a good figure and "the five facial features in the right order".
They must be above average in height, i.e. 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The compulsory retirement age is 26.
The officers said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
"It's their image that's important", one district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the outward qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; these are height, weight, facial features, etc".
Then there are temperament and "inner qualities".
The women of Chengguan are like flower pots, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city district management office, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard norm in many Chinese job listings for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement relating to the order of facial features.
What it means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
It is true that disabled or disfigured persons should not apply.
"We cannot let a lame or a hump come and serve here", said Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't make a good impression".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has a rounded cheek with a thinly curved mouth.
She does not consider the emphasis on her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a dismayed look.
His 21-year-old colleague at the ditches, Xu Yang, says: "Our job is to present the image of the city".
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing vendors down the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many rolls or tofu bowls as possible before running away.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We have told you many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart.
The agents describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
"It's pretty much the same thing every day", said Huang Jing, a 20-year-old who studies marketing after work.
"It's a lot of routine".
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity toward the bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after false rumors spread that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and Chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But there is no guarantee of calm.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner.
The officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a shop, as required by law.
The owner of the motorcycle was shouting about the scandal.
A 15-minute gunfight ensued before the grim-faced police force elbowed their way to their vehicle and sped away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned upside down to hide his name.
Like the female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 or over - are purely a supporting role.
Unlike women, they are not trained to maintain a positive image.
"We sometimes fight with words".
"Sometimes we fight physically", said Mr. Li in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts".
The prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have dropped criminal charges against Senator John Ensign stemming from a case involving a former campaign aide and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The ruling ends the most serious legal threat facing Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Department of Justice had "informed him that Senator Ensign is no longer the subject of the investigation and that it does not intend to pursue any charges against him in this case".
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative lobbying work to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer on a campaign for Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been an associate of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called revolving door lobbying ban.
From the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to rape and substantial violation of the revolving door law", said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-profile setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for failure to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them", she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a DOJ prosecutor on Monday and a follow-up call the next day, telling him that the DOJ was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's legal team had cooperated with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada corporation that has long supported the senator, is a company that Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work for.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company had welcomed Mr Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr Ensign's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Home Office over a contentious issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair broke last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign announced two weeks ago that he intends to seek a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's appeal will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping away in the courtroom rows.
They were sending out horrific reports of witness accounts every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were over 140,000 posts about the rape trial and the children tied to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of murdering three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to reach a formal conclusion where the judge will impose the death penalty, as voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that eludes appeals arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting of the trial - along with the widespread and extensive use of Twitter by journalists - created a "circus atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary detail that the jury was badly influenced by the passions of the audience.
The request could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technology requires new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technology into courtrooms is infringing on the individual's rights to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for Mr. Hayes.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the state Supreme Court laconically rejected the claims in his ruling last week, saying that the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was motivated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the final word on the matter.
Appeals courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland osteopath Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, holding that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have said that appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage courtroom communications, unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media" in high-profile trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue says that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instantaneous communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers that could be debated for years, delaying execution.
The defense lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he abused pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept stoking the flames of the case's emotion.
"The daily rush of tweets from media, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse", the lawyers wrote, "was unlike anything seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally".
Their focus on Twitter's coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that instant news was more incendiary than slower-moving news releases was a Luddite view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeal courts were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' attorneys are insisting on that claim.
In their filing, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court decision which overturned Dr Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they said they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century".
Can civility bridge the gaps?
After a campaign marked by both vilification and negativity, a modicum of civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of genuine bipartisan cooperation moving forward or an illusory moment before the quick return to partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the big issues to be addressed during the "lame duck" session.
But clearly, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as about the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the President's Committee on the Budget Deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide; however, it still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a period of testing and testing each other for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and voter patience for renewed partisan warfare.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, spending, health care or duties, the two sides remain miles apart.
Yet the November election had tempered Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no question that things have changed on the tone", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the election.
Elections are partisan passions, and then they fade.
It's good".
On some issues, including the agenda for the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts are going to expire at the end of the year, and nobody's in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans can't afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed worker.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the "lame duck" session, with the ratification of the New START pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the lame duck session will not necessarily prevent a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be done are done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations", he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea voters who helped create it.
But Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of going too far, they know they have to try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, pushing back the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their words, forced the issue of the deficit onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they needed 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there is little motive or willingness to compromise on tax issues, at least today.
Galston foresees two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, tax and health care; to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then both sides will watch closely for public reaction.
The one who is judged to be a loser will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility displayed this week could be enjoyed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US documents describe Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city is controlled by a "Kleptocracy" and some of the bribes and protection money it collects is passed on to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are engaged in huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized crime groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written when Yuri Lyukov was still mayor of Moscow, and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little evidence of cleanup since then.
Lyukhov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have consistently denied the corruption allegations over the years; and he has won several libel cases over these accusations.
In September, he told a Russian TV channel, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwaway, it's nothing".
The overwhelming majority of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be for diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime led some to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government", according to the embassy's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term used in the criminal world/la mafia that literally means 'roof' or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City government.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow".
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"The FSB, MVD and militia are on the second level".
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the bottom".
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services".
The report says that the FSB is sifting the money of the biggest companies and the police are targeting the smaller ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than the criminal groups but they are also protected by the law".
"That's why the demand for protection from criminal gangs is not as high anymore".
The note notes that although the collection of money is widespread, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who delay in paying their debts are forced to close their businesses for one reason or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption but admitted little progress.
The embassy memo reports reports men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats", said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy".
"He is not part of a political class because there is no such class in Russia".
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to INDEM, the cost of corruption in Russia as a whole is more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was only made public late last night, Moscow time, will surely stir up discontent within the Russian government; and while Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is resolving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin speculated that the WikiLeaks documents may have been fabricated and reacted angrily to the remarks that US diplomats had leaked calling him Batman and comparing Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in the internal politics of this country", he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit classroom with shriveled concrete walls of poor quality, the principal of Anlong Veng High School spoke of the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality when he was the leader of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally being called into question.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the Khmer Rouge history to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence against a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch", to 35 years in prison.
This development has increased anxiety among the former Khmer Rouge fighters in Anlong Veng, complicating their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil".
"The situation is creating divisions within families".
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot United government in 1979, the remainder of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Mok Ta prepared a follow-up at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect from the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held out, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk into the poverty common to rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers kept their local leadership positions in exchange for laying down their arms, these are unskilled farmers at the lowest rank and file.
"These people have received very little follow-up after surrender", said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organises public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are steeped in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology".
"They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept".
Sor Lim, 55, joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good", he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone".
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves".
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also caused trouble here.
The court is expected to start the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to try senior officials and those most responsible for the crimes but it did not say whether it would pursue beyond these four cases.
It would take more than that to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation has turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summons her, she says, she'll refuse to go.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted multiple suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But facing the past is all that Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces", he said.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand".
The centre produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, 75 pages".
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he returned home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court", he says.
"They are wary because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
High in the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated at the site.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray", she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day, she planned to walk to Pol Pot's final resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of military grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component of nuclear weapons, in a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide.
The deal was leaked in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had for years tried to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a research center in Belarus.
That paved the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the remaining roughly 500 pounds of material, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, which was organized at the initiative of Obama; Belarus was excluded.
It seems to have been a successful effort to invite the former Soviet republic to follow-up summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit".
"This proves to me that this process works", said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did that under George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have stored highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium", Mr Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our product ... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone".
"We're just going to use it for research, that's all".
Belarus has been moving closer to the United States in recent months, though with an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government spent $13 million in its efforts, much of it to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization was put in place to build confidence", leading to the Clinton-signed agreement, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens", she said.
The government has raised no objection to the CIA's flights
The government has no objections to CIA flights carrying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo Bay through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is evidenced by the documents leaked by Wikileaks (cables) to the daily El País, which adds that the first vice-president of the Government at that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance over foreign planes that crossed Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accused a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council report "had surprised the Zapatero Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" so that they are not "taken by surprise", Aguirre said in a cable.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to keep the profile of this case as low as possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence".
In turn, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González informed the Embassy that he would not block the initiative of the judge to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Defense Department on the CIA robberies.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information", the embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information from CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments", Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba commented that "even though the Spanish judges are insanely jealous of his independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the United States that could be construed as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government", she said.
The confessed parricide complained online about the "burden" of being a mother
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used since she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both originated from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she is originally.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you have to know his love life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they separated, it was discovered that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take a DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a nearby municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to research the labour market, the boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, it is understood that their romance has broken down, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and offended that I came to work there".
"When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants".
And then, she talks about a cell phone message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address so I can send the baby to you".
"If he doesn't like it", she complains, "let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll get it when I get home".
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going away, but I'll only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go to a work station so I don't lose it".
She explains that if everything was fine, she would have taken her eldest son with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is with me, and I will never let him out of my life with another person if that person is not my mother", dubious intention, considering their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits it, it's assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is content on one side, but he is not content on the other".
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes it here a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day".
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
"He'll go there for a few hours in the summer and that way I'll save some money on the babysitter".
17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you'll come".
"Alberto says he sent you some videos on e-mail, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit".
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
His current partner, Víctor, has one: "He gives me money in advance".
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the now-blocked MySpace universe, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator".
"Terror in the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man she lived with, on guard, says he's sorry for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that it was over because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was admitted to the provincial penitentiary of Palma yesterday, from the detention center of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the events happened, "nor did she have the intention to harm the minor".
She'd previously confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecution have requested a psychiatric evaluation.
The People's Party members would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these committees is normally double that it receives in the Catalan regions.
Thus, the Catalan populars obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won by 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which is expected to lead to a shift in the votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate to the PP, is maintained, the analysts of this formation have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose no more and no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental for the PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular vote, ERC would lose one deputy - it now has three - while ICV would keep one or gain one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would be in May 2011 for the municipal councils, where the popular people can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that handles the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populists agree that the PSC could lose the Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona mayorships, where the socialists would not get a majority nor the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
In view of the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful if this party loses its representation in Barcelona's city council - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP increased its vote in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP only registered a 500 vote difference to PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign they met several times.
The populars also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detained in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian man detained by officers of the Barcelona Police's General Information Commissionerate formed a jihadist cell which, led from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Tamil Tigers for the Liberation of the Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the perpetrator of the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus was "disabled" at the international level and "therefore, its operational capacity".
Investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it was active in Catalonia, may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were forged and then distributed to groups that were part of the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why other European police units, apart from the Thai services, participated in the investigations, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be attacks similar to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona in the following days.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani nationals Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another operation was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijrungbum.
They were the ones who ran the cell from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the conditions set by the so-called "Global Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between 25 and 45 years old, with validity for several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay bombing, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups that received the passports that were stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, a few thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency which were "invested" to buy mobile cards which were used afterwards by the "commando" members who killed 106 people.
The police have seized a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend the tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those presented during the campaign and which are to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures such as economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address in the middle of his term.
The president of the Catalan Populars arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the confidence that comes from having obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday's elections, a number more than enough to make himself liked, because the CiU candidate requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the investiture.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but for the moment the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereignist and independenceist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their commitment to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration lean and the elimination of the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's appointment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center don't rule out the possibility that their night nurse killed over 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric hospital La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during the period he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsibility".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the big threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime was committed in August 2009 and that from that day on he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in his ruling that he was ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - and he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality was carried out by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and said that "lack of action could never have been the cause of what happened".
The lawyer for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of imprudence on the part of any other person than the accused".
The person already baptized as "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting her with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
Insulin injections and a cocktail of sedatives were the mechanism employed in six of the nine murders that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the inmates' suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying when he says that he sought a less cruel death for his first victims or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laxatives as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of confessed murders, they do not exclude the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain at the disposal of the judiciary to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat to
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "the markets must not underestimate our capacity to react".
Peripheral spreads closed strongly and European bank stocks fell by over 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB's capacity to make mistakes either, and the euro has barely increased, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which, as it collapses, recovers, but motivated by closing short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to get over his fear.
A month ago, the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures with a term and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures will be extended 'at least until March' and that the quarterly auction with unlimited access will be maintained at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying programme will be continued and that the signal will even be given to intensify it.
If they do not live up to the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to blindly withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as they did in their May meeting where they said they hadn't even considered buying bonds and they crashed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year lease auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous bid.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the whole curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland holes were published.
The estimated figures represent 10 million short-term and 15 thousand potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it does not yet have enough support, so Ireland remains in a state of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are one union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest want to play Beethoven's "Hymn to Joy".
In Spain, the President had the opportunity yesterday to present the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market fell by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today there is a key bid for a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be self-immolation.
They'd give us a line of liquidity we don't need, the Treasury has over 40 billion in liquidity available, triple what it was in March, to very expensive types and they're cutting off access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "not to be, but to appear".
Take heart, we can get through this!
The president of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia advice requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "no right", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are granted legal immunity for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem to be willing to give up his litigation to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from the board of directors by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, whose dispute is registered in the Commercial and Companies Register.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrado Number 2 of Madrid, has again opened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to set the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal by the plaintiffs to his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly fraudulently the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18", according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the assembly to be contested as "null and void" once it has taken place.
The same parties, who have been quietly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the magistrate to call a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless seeks the usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This is the substantive matter that the judge must decide after the hearing on the petition for which there is no date yet.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software is creating real-time upgrades to cars.
From the moment Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without diminishing the skill of the champion, the German Sebastian Vette, as a driver, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 there is talk of the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is in reality a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far from the high-end motor racing.
Called PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to create assembly lines for the world's manufacturing plants, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, to simulate the product or process accurately before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four upgrades to the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and design all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all the elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
We're changing the materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics, the safety features.
Changes can go from simulated virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological perfection is the $40 million each Formula 1 team can spend as a cap each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this task is 580 people, including two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is, without a doubt, the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put to use for its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and whose notoriety is zero.
The factory's technology director, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be argued that R&D progress in the case of racing cars was responsible for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up 20 of its own stores with local distributors within two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of a network of 20 stores of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the refurbished store on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy which includes the 20 Spanish outlets.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero would not reveal the next possible shops, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and designs the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff in the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive chain of shops aims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pilot programme that solves potential problems with HP's IT equipment under warranty.
An online service connects you to a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that often take two days".
"This system is designed specifically for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell's managing director, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of the liabilities.
Nevertheless, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially compensated by increases in commissions and the cost of credit.
Sabadell expects to have a million individual customers in three years, and that's the job.
Sabadell found a way to exploit for the next three years and survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, apart from surviving without having to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain market share by attracting one million new retail customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who may leave the bank - a major task to accomplish, since until now the bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year, he's got 250,000 private customers and 50,000 corporate clients.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it is over 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, because the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell will in fact be finalising this year its Optima master plan, drawn up four years ago, although the plan was originally for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more year.
The clients who let the savings banks slip will be his primary target.
During a breakfast event organised by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years' time it will be 'very difficult to create jobs', which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of liabilities - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of the risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issues to gain liquidity is already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor in the pressure on credit".
"We didn't tighten the valve, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November-.
He also admitted that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase fees", but "there is a competitive framework".
The management plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not exclude the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater dimensions will be required".
"Everything will be moving next year", he assured.
He says capital needs are "increasing dramatically" and that some Spanish financial entities could be in the red.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed the fact that some bankers are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He said that it was not possible to issue bonds, but that unlike what happened in June, short-term funding could be obtained through repos, which would ease the crisis.
The ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings bank mergers and stressed again the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would reserve for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been completed, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments".
"Most of it has been completed; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too", the manager stressed.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out within the deadlines that we have set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he said.
"The move from 45 banks with an average of 28.500 million in assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process unparalleled in history, by reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unhappy opinions about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind us that we must meet the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and he blamed those who questioned it for a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had recovered well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have prompted a two-pronged government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of unemployment aid without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility for unlocking the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the one of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, speculation is beginning in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
First, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the South would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third is a new design of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal austerity, fines for countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments for one of them and the extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been for a long time, so there is no room for excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were boosting deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought it should do (tax austerity plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow to the Central European country was when Merkel barely extended the decision to bail out Greece.
From that moment it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion was against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, albeit a little watered down, was approved and in the months to come we should see the reform of the Union which will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that they don't think they'll cross.
And it tells us all that, even if now we have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old way of working of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mark the birth of a new currency area, where countries that break the rules will be severely punished, may be forced to default, and in that case the private sector will also bear part of the costs.
Germany is signalling that we need to follow a tough growth path with high saving and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The stakes are clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked to do is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us a greater peace.
And we'll know how to seize the opportunity that's been given to us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has heard it too in this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the way has been opened to the thesis that we must put order in the house.
But the red line Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to be moving it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone that is too crowded with countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she warned us.
Sport and the Law
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape sanction.
The alleged expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 Champions League match against Ajax has sparked much speculation about the unsportsmanlike nature of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team was already winning clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made fouls to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will end up leading their group, the two players will complete the regulatory penalty during the next match of the barrage match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of the sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen in the case is due to the fact that this has had a team from the Real Madrid entity as protagonists (which in its anthem displays nobility and honor and which in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his extended story of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the rules contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are committed in violation of the law; in fact, they are actions that respect the sporting regulations, but seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they cause to the sportsman's mind.
One of the assets that comprise the spirit of sport is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these goods that is referred to with fair play is to prevent the offending team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not conform to what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders derive from the intentional wrongs examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put one's opponent at a disadvantage and one does not gain an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't rely on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is an advantage in the long run, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and besides, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of the sport, which still includes the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not take action to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud), but rather chose the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without evading the penalty or running away from it.
Although the line between genius and law-breaking is blurred, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to provoke them.
The damage to the principles of sport caused by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates a flood of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tourot and the lottery, when December arrives, so too do the pre-Christmas group dinners, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which, because of the crisis, have resulted in an offensive of adjusted prices to capture the majority of customers: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, coincide with the businessmen and associations in the sector interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has concentrated the requests into the week of December 13, resulting so far in a flood of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the hard times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To keep up the tradition, many employees organize them, paying out of their own pockets.
The new rules will be based on the principle of 'one country, two systems'.
The employer's representative, now, dares not predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before they book".
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices", he says.
The deal will go well "for those who offer quality at a good price and with a good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so that the 25 euro range has become the majority in demand.
A survey of various institutions in the center shows a collapse in applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras Group says that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar assumed more advance bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done our best to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros", they say.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in turnover since the second half of the year and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources in the group say that the 18th will also be a very active day for groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with €30 or more as the famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees back and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
On behalf of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident that the end of the tunnel is in sight and maintains that overall bookings are "animated", even if customers "bargain to the fullest".
It is true that the hope for the festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he said.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons "at a rate faster than any other country".
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that Washington is causing about Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The specificity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled but are stored in components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is a major concern in Washington.
In a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson of Pakistan stated: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersal of nuclear materials with a high noise level and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs", Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with his US counterparts.
The newest of the leaked documentation from Julian Assange's website is the ever-decreasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy dispatch, which called communication with Pakistan "frustrating", said: "Transparency is frequently lacking; offers of help go unanswered or are eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama will appoint a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track down any movement and locate Assange.
All aspects of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have any certainty about the facts.
Interpol yesterday issued a "red alert" to "locate and track Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, this one's not new, otherwise it's dated November 20th.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest leak of over a quarter million US diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks founder Mark Stephens, a lawyer, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20th the international police force headquartered in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol were instructed to identify or locate Assange "in order to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest warrant for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization explains, consider the red notice call a free path for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder had shown himself willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, who is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter said.
While the world is searching for him - and in Australia his mother is defending her son's innocence - Assange continues to be in the unknown, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an unspecified interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering American graduates to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign", he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should be of any interest to us", he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a top counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are voicing these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be the chairman of the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to consider whether to list WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides it with contributions or assistance".
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to backtrack after saying that Assange would have to "be assassinated".
"Obama should turn it into a lens and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that".
One person who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything short of an execution would be too kind a punishment", he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with a wink to the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote on its continuity in a secret ballot.
Huguet proposed a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it absolutely cannot give him the headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That's why the leader of Esquerra will try to win over his new critics with winking that will allow him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that over 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodians want to convey some sort of penalty vote to the president, they can do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the ranking officer wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian" result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand little more from the president than to make his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worth while Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But since they don't have a majority to force resignations, they'll try to get the executive to agree on a road map by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the National Council for voting on the 18th.
It is intended to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders consider as a given.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his aim is to make the organisation, once and for all, able to wash its own laundry in the family room.
In this regard, the article that the current councilor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, and he underlined two.
The first is to "re-compose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is to say, to include new figures who come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second may be the news-type.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as the operating mechanism.
He therefore advocated a reform of the statutes which would allow congresses to be held by delegates elected by universal suffrage.
The end of the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of Puigcercós's team, who have already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulse conclave of 2008 instructed the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific congress of reform of the statutes.
This meeting has not yet been completed, as the internal tide of recent years has not recommended that this subject be discussed.
Now, with no critical areas to look out for, this might be a good time to take it over and shut it down for good.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
The murders include those of three women and the discovery of two mutilated bodies in Valle de México.
In the last month of the year, 390 deaths were reported, theoretically linked to organized crime.
Among the cases mentioned is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipe de Toluca.
Subject had at least three gunshots and the head wound, except for the hands and feet tied with a wire.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Early Thursday morning, four, the owners of common land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal gunshots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A message was found near the body, signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old man was shot eight times as he left his house to start the garbage collection.
On November 7, two men aged 30 were killed by a gunshot wound to the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the gunshot wound to the forehead, a man's body was found on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo, and under the body was found a bullet from a .25 caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, human body parts were found in the blackwater channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency responders conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body parts, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted the public to the discovery of a body in Peña Colorada, with his hands tied behind his back and his eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month, it was reported that two men were executed, wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the department of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, and at the same time, two death warning messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, two women were found wrapped in blankets in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man was found in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshot wounds to the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
The woman's skin was found to have Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with his image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads cut off and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Next to the bodies was a message signed by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message on the side; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a bristle with a note.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The country's representative at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and said that it maintains its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China is sticking to its pledge to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China's representative to COP16.
In her first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that her country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress was made in all these areas, including the passing last year of a new Energy Act, which recognises the objectives addressed in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with the government and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented for the past five years and which has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private sector.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps to energy-efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of that country on climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than what is thought.
For example, he said, China's per capita emissions of greenhouse gases are three tonnes per person, while in the US they are 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to do another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of the Spanish: Cesar Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former leader of the PAN party has the right to address the National Order Commission to demand what is right.
In the interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Board of the Order of Sonora".
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal, if necessary, to the National Council's Law Commission, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body", he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance for the presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, when a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been an approach for the local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective", he said.
The PAN leader mentioned that PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition doesn't scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and it makes us stronger", he said.
He said that the board will probably know the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the board".
"I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party chairman to any of the five".
He predicted that the party's surge in the July 4 elections will be reflected in the next contest, even if "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"For the moment, it is important to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerge from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have "made many hopes about them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years in government, Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón, let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet", he said.
He said that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no muzzle, and even less censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for students without papers
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation", the US president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree with the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation", tweeted Obama.
His short message maintains an open cyberlink to a larger document that asks the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to make your voice heard", he said.
The message was leaked after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any legislation if the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and funding for the government continues.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by all 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other bills such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican block on the Dream Act and other bills, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he's confident that once the tax problem is resolved we can set an agenda for the rest of the bills.
"I think we have plenty of time...
"We all agree that this fiscal problem must be solved before the end of the year"...
"I think we can get an agreement at some point on this and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he will be seeking a "closing debate vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on as early as next Thursday in the Senate, though most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who came to the United States before they were 16, stayed in the country for the past five years, and were accepted by a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are engaged in intense lobbying to ensure the bill's passage.
The Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That's why the Dream Act's supporters require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans were Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who filled the term of his fellow Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they would not support it in another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Even though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature, we put our finger on the wound.
The second stage of the Pleasures of Language was a walk in which the participants showcased their storytelling skills.
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... finger on the wound? What do they expect from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound"...it puts us in a state of embarrassment", the Argentine writer gently launched to the audience, most of whom were young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
She left the infectious disease clinic with the conviction that "patience is not my strong suit, it may be my wound".
Finally, after a frustrated approach with the trauma specialist who took his breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explained that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighs with relief and concludes: "on the wound I could only know that it is that which is opened in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very closely linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative titled "Elohim to the Invention", where the finger on the wound is not named but at a certain moment is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a young lady had lost, a narrative that turns to talk then America, the great news that had its own chroniclers from the beginning and quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of the narratives of the conquering captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, "laughed at the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, "but in a way that would never have told the history of America "with an imagination that lacked even modesty".
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known which part of the narrative belongs to one band or the other, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It is by inheritance that one is what one is told".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the invitation of the FIL with her round table Le doit sur la plaie.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman spoke about the great scourge of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America is going through - produced by the drug trafficking and drug sales disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain an unspoken commitment which is of course not premeditated", she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that this is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also underlined "it must be on the writer's wound committed".
He considered that in a world which lives at great speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every negation there is a little yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put the finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white", he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Romano on the hunt for his first title.
Ruben Omar Romano has lost three finals, had his ups and downs in his career, but he's made it to the playoffs three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that face each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a marked contrast by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has reached the deciding series three times, even if so far he has not hit the target and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consolating himself with the runner-up medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The strategist Santista reached his first final as a coach in the Open Tournament 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a 4-2 overall result against Toluca; later, in the Closure 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the 3-1 overall result and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, as his team made a 2-2 draw against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he got a 3-1 lead with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 metres and he suffered the jump to the score of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to free himself from the curse to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important", commented the helmsman when asked what would be his weak points in the finals.
He remembers the last final, from which he says he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can take is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson, before the end of the match you can not celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to reach the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny has done us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish of holding the title in our hands, it has escaped us, it has served us as the lesson for this final and we hope that we do not arrive in this situation again".
Now Romano has the opportunity to stop being a runner-up and to experience the glory of the titles for the first time.
The European Union is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost and waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the US Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves at the Visa Applicant Service Centres (VASCs) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The applicant's biometric information will be collected by ASC staff and reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, among which are the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to make one payment to get an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the courier to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, but will only be required to attend the nearest CSA where they will present documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who wish to have a second interview in the Consular Section will be there for a shorter period than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the additional $26 service fee.
For more information on the new procedure for applying for a visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/bulletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has cited the press to announce tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for life in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When quoted by the press, NASA assured that it would present "any impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", which has sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures like us in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming human-like intelligent beings if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any life form because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life, and this ability leads us to believe that similar life might exist on other planets that don't have our beneficial atmosphere.
If these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, say astrobiologists, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the full extent of the findings at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), in the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
The first is the 'bloc' of Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón.
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just taken place when an opposing bloc appeared in Congress led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four were questioning one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the opening of the inaugural session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'protested' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we are introducing 'bipartisanship' because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control Congress.
The four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directory chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reforms in an institutional way we constitute the political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be enslaved again by both parties and in this way will end the opposition coalition.
"So far (the opposition coalition) is what I'm looking at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that there are coincidences with PRD, PT and Patrón and that is why they form a plural group.
He said that the Congress, having been a monopoly, could not be allowed to become a "duopoly".
"It is not in the spirit of law reform that there should be perpetual bipartisanship in Congress".
To begin with, this group started with five legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to get more of them, the Convergent added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that now the Congress has become a 'booty' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they split it into two".
Patrón Montalvo has asked that the Member's personality be respected and that he be allowed a seat at the negotiating table.
"They should not let five, which will probably be nine members, leave the Chamber by means of a coupled agreement. Now we are five, separated into different groups, and we have decided to unite to seek a place at the negotiating table. That is the problem, because in the reform they have made, which they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with that reform".
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlán is paying another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this one, the amount we paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this latest check number 9258447 was issued on November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of suppliers account".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the municipality would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supreme Audit to sell at a higher price.
What we haven't reported is the total debt and, therefore, combos of checks will be issued again in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just paid him what we owed, like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last checks "disappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, 19 October, 29 October and the last one on November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official State Gazette, as provided by the law when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after the 25th of July Noroeste had published a review of the checks that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks for over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cleaned up
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions at the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into a hole in the roundabout of Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be cleaned up and that new activities should replace the ones that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they wouldn't have been doing the work for so long and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through preventive maintenance and not just do the corrective", he said.
"We want to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we have to maintain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live in and the City Council has to change its strategy to maintain the city well".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, constant maintenance of tourist attractions", he said.
"They have not been given the attention they deserve and this kind of fact highlights something that is known to all, maintenance is necessary".
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not being used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be aligned with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered, cleaned and put on the line for us to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination".
IP wants results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that it faces.
The business sector of Mazatlán is calling for a dignified working legislature free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces great problems.
Yesterday the 60th legislature was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of the Government Congress is a clean management and committed to society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that the Members of Parliament will really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary for them to make pacts to protect their own interests and they become a carnival masquerade for the governors and the leaders of the parliamentary factions".
That is why I am asking them to certify their commitment to establishing the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will make sure that they do a worthy job and above all engaged with the society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job creation".
As for tourism, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that this is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign currency and investment and directly competing with agribusiness".
Apart from the fact that resources must be allocated to tourism projects that help to give the state security and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures could not solve.
We 're looking for a Mage King .
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desires of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Three Kings Day will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more or less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live from day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it is very difficult for us because my husband is unemployed, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' to sell on the street", says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaida, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
José Alfredo, 10, has long wanted a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothing that is a year old.
"He said (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster,' but I said 'we'll see, my son,' because he was very dear", Cayetana sadly recalls.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12, Isaías, 10, wears size 10, and Miguel, 8, wears size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan needs a pair of sneakers, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be a big help.
If you want to help make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela children come true, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for a Magician King" by donating a toy or money to the Noroeste reception.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in premises that were believed to be used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the ring, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of producing cannabis, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were the result of a long-standing investigation that lasted almost a year.
"It was information from the public that allowed us to make these arrests", Mr Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation unit of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
The illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should fix the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter".
"I stand with a party that has created the granite under your feet", said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, as he surrounded MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would allow for the detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that he could not support the bill, because it was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government does", Mr Duceppe said.
NDP critic Olivia Chow has dismissed critics of her party's lack of toughness on illegal immigration.
"The New Democrats are in favour of taking action against smugglers and we are doing that through another bill, Bill C-35", said Ms Chow.
"We are not supporting the Conservative bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for at least a year", Ms Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling the House that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a doormat".
"They expect Canada to take firm action", Minister Kenney said.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led to an election if it had been rejected.
However, a Conservative told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that any MP who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
Public Safety Minister Robert Dutil says the idea is not new: Quebec has been consulting the New York Department of Investigation on the matter since January.
The city has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Still, Tuesday's announcement surprised many.
It should be noted that this measure was never discussed at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no wonder that the public safety critic Stéphane Bergeron called the announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a solution made-up on the corner of a table".
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the protection of the environment.
"You'll see the result when we announce it", he says.
"We are aware of this problem".
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggests that Quebec should give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General", he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the verifier the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's cards.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request was made by the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
Federal Minister for Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently looking at amendments to the bill.
During Operation Spring 2001, which targeted motorcycle gangs, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several waterways remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has fallen in several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide is said to have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
Heavy rain fell in several areas from Tuesday to Wednesday evening, with rainfall ranging from 40 to 70 millimetres.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres of rain was expected by Thursday evening, depending on the region.
The areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since this must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear of overflow of several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the Nord, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Chene, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood watches and were under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the overflow of lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In St. Calixtus, a temporary bridge was washed away by heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Ottawa, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Center issued flood warnings for several rivers on Wednesday, including the Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Dupont partly to blame
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Council of Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his foul language on air.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team were entitled to express their opinions, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts".
The Council also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two people who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the program were inaccurate.
The presenters should present sound information rather than misleading information.
As for suicide, the host Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was a cowardly act.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be viewed as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee finds that the episodes in question of "Two o'clock at noon" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner".
So no blame was laid on him.
The last dispute was over statements following the earthquake in Haiti.
The two men had a media confrontation which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because there was no way to know for sure that the needy people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not excessive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on that".
"My file has been clean for a year and a half", said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the use of obscene language.
In each case, CHOI-FM cooperated 'beyond its obligation'.
The consequences for the station are minimal, which will have to, among other things, announce these decisions once during peak viewing hours within three days.
A Kung Fu King in Montreal
Montreal's Algerian-born Nacereddine Zemmal has a very special background.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the world's tatami and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria", explains Zemmal, who moved to the city in 2008 to become a professional martial artist.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere, since for those who do not like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America".
Recently, the UPS security guard and clerk delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"Right now I'm preparing to go to China for the World San Shou Cup".
"Fighters who finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited".
"I won the bronze medal in 2009 in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I came third in Toronto in 2009", he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've progressed in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San Shou or Sanda is a Chinese martial art in which punching and kicking, as well as throwing, are permitted.
Duels originally took place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of fighting is the Vietnamese-American Cung Le, well-known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event to remember in his career, he will surely answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This is the most important and prestigious competition in China", explained the friendly young man.
"It's a bit like the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)".
"It was a great experience".
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his weight class (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The guy who beat me was a real pro", he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg) "
"The winners of the semi-finals will face each other in the final of their respective category".
"The winners of each category then face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu".
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has won the largest, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Énergie gérance, was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this large hydropower project, worth $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
The Parti Québécois considers that the use of consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem which risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
"This is the new way of colluding and killing off competition".
"That is to say that people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly", said the Pequist MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he could hardly see how the public interest could be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded this afternoon, vigorously denying that there was any collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip", she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigor".
She said "it would be the last thing" for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
This is usually a limited-time alliance where two or more companies pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is a highly complex one given the scale of the work.
The construction is underway and is scheduled to last until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competitive action; there was a negotiation.
Consortium formulas are therefore no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick glance at the business register of Quebec reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
The Dessau firm is working in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens, leads back to one and the same legal entity, Dessau.
As for the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay area responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in a particular way since the 1970s".
The Eastmain project's chief executive, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JBSE), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows about the fact that the project's management contract was awarded on a voluntary basis.
"If you go to bidding and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher".
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price".
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people", said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $ 50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting its participation in Energy Management.
All the contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,13564 contract to Energy Management.
Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
Minister Normandeau dropped the idea that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
The 'green' label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly skeptical.
The Québec consumer has very little confidence in the sustainability actors, but also in fair trade brands and ecological certifications to guide his choices.
The report also calls for the introduction of a European public service broadcasting system, which would enable the public to be informed about the activities of the European Union's public service broadcasting system.
Even though they increased the consumption of products that are socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies or in the green advertising of companies, according to the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are shown as being eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take the speech of politicians on this issue seriously.
Information on responsible consumption is, however, essential to stimulate this part of consumption, which is currently being carried out by nearly one third of Quebec consumers.
The fact that the information is empty and dubious would appease the ardor of 46% of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
A third of Quebecers also said they were suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services that they were offered.
On another note, nearly half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
61% also preferred to shop at local stores and preferred to buy food grown in their area, says the Barometer.
Greener and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the recycling king who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by taking care of the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological awareness, however, seems to remain outside his car, says the Baromètre: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport or recommended carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large behavioural survey, which has just taken its first picture.
A loan from the State for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to make a financial commitment to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and Parallèle companies, agreed to cooperate, but only on the basis of a loan.
The development company Angus and the Parallel, who hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on the boulevard Saint-Laurent, giving it its full cinéphilic vocation, do not get what they were asking for.
The government agrees to be involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government proposes a loan, the amount of which is less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution at favorable conditions, at least according to the sources from the offices of the State.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counterproposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the state grant hypothesis really has to be ruled out.
The Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
But several members of the community were instead calling for substantial financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the cinema, had for ten years been running the auteur cinema in his premises in the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the part of the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent theatres in Montreal was a problem, and eXcentris had built a loyal following.
Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are also piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to get the acquisition underway.
As of spring 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to show movies on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February with the screening of the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois, Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini has not called Le Devoir back and it is not known what he and his group think of the offers made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new US diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the US considers to be the Canadian inferiority complex towards Americans, but they also betray the latter's sense of superiority towards Canada.
Thus, American diplomats wonder why every Canadian voter did not have Canada-US relations in mind when they went to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government pass its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were displayed in public yesterday, offer more glittering details than substantial content to digest.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, during the midst of a federal election campaign, described how the United States was not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the surprise of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins, the two men were arrested.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of everyday life rather than making this election about the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of".
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to vote".
The other expression of this feeling of importance is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, when Canada will post its first deficit in over a decade due to a $30-40 billion stimulus plan", Mr. Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to prorogue parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC are sending back to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the shows Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which contain subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's abductions for interrogation.
Another cable says that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to take in some of the Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The secretary has agreed to review the file".
And finally, there's a lot of heat about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the man responsible for the massive leak should be "assassinated".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to improve lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancún a plan to upgrade domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to see adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs which still control 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, better, by light emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the world's car fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to bring global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we'll have to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance to get to a level of 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 to avoid it going out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5 percent as light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy demand is reduced by two times.
Compact bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - which was also involved in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the savings that could be made with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about the use of fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place safety precautions.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the gains that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast is nervously awaiting the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire to be published "without delay" after the deadline.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay", a spokesman for the UN chief said.
'It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.'
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the midnight deadline to pass without releasing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the President of the ECI had stated on television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
Calls were made around the world on Wednesday for the ECI to finally announce the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to annul "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebel group of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had dissuaded the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The whole election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents say the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northerner who denies any links to the former rebels, called the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from releasing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to be the culmination of the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that has been divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead in the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as measured by the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan area (9.7% including the overseas departments), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted data (SVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area stands at 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% with the OCTs.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, regardless of whether they were available within two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has worsened further, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, which has risen to 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
The elderly, on the other hand, experienced a slight rise in unemployment, at 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), i.e. 482 000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the Dominican Republic.
Only the 25-49 age group enjoyed stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolitan area (-0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and placed in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste-treatment company manager and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, was charged and sentenced to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with abuse of social goods, embezzlement of public funds and property, susel, active corruption, trafficking of influence and possession of ammunition, said his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies".
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of wrongful charges, it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, the brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, insisted, through his lawyers, to pass a memo to the judge before his hearing in order to explain himself.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also questioned Wednesday night and killed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the waste dumps he had to manage.
As for the allocation of markets or the destination of funds linked to their operation, he was never aware of it, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and released under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has provided explanations for the facts alleged against him".
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty", said his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) cleanliness department, is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two civil servants from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are being investigated for "subtraction and misappropriation of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, the partner of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was put under investigation for "evidence of abuse of social goods".
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently convicted in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies were used to launder money from the big gang.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
According to a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: the Elysee has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spying", kept public opinion in France on edge, put diplomacy on high alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and accessed by Le Monde reveal some of the underlying causes of the crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice for dealing with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman was not in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in the spotlight the way in which the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was not.
A diplomatic cable written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The French Foreign Minister, Mr François Richier, and the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Mr Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They're explaining the French method to him.
They are advising the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make a noise", they say, "keep hammering" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Do it, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do it".
Because, despite attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters of delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 in bail).
He said the Elysée was expecting more hostage situations, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he said.
The 28th of August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but she's still stuck in Iran.
A report is circulating: Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man whom the United States is seeking for extradition for illegally trafficking sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, has been released in Paris, following a decision by a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is puzzled by this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran's clandestine networks for acquiring material for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France agreed to a trade ?
The Iranian's release for the French woman's?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken aback by the judge's decision" but tried to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the keeper of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision", he observed.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Mr Kakavand remains under the 'close' surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysee counselor dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysée is making every effort, through press releases and leaks to the media, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with some irony, and note that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to "the 'blitz' of French officials in the media".
The embassy in Paris wonders what the "gratitude" to Mr Assad is based on.
"Despite their laudatory statements, French officials privately admit they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done".
The document then examines the reasons which led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he said.
The policy, launched in 2008, was "perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserving".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is seeking to "show Syria what praise it can earn for playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy has a good source on this.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything".
"But we thanked them anyway".
"It should at least confuse the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is set to pass a so-called "Cinderella" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under the age of 16, representatives from the ministries of culture and family said.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying in school and living a normal life during the day".
"We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep", Jo Rin, the ministry responsible for the bill, told AFP.
The online games will be available again at 6:00 a.m.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the amount of time that young people can access these games on a daily basis if their parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available free software to people who request it, which will help them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
FIFA announces the hosts of the 2018-2022 World Cup
Amidst the turmoil over corruption allegations, Fifa's executive committee on Thursday decided on the 2018 and 2022 World Cup host countries, a highly political choice where influence and lobbying may override technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen competition will take place in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 event will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
So the backstage negotiations may last until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) records have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which was behind the revelations that led to the suspension of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) for corruption, may have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, which hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC added to the confusion on Monday by airing a documentary that singled out three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This has displeased FIFA and embarrassed the British officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the forefront.
The prime minister hopes to repeat the success of his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to redecorate England's coat of arms at the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (World Cup-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial outlook for both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a heavy outsider despite the shortcomings in its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a thinly veiled allusion to the accusations of the British press against the EC members.
"We are covering them with mud, trying to compromise them", Mr Putin said.
In 2022, the United States, with its experience in 1994, is the logical favourite.
The country, the world's leading economic power and home to the main sponsors of FIFA, seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very good project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa is eagerly seeking, would effectively end Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, who has taken the big game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new lands, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of the war for FIFA.
Second term of office: the evidence
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it seem that he was hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate to do so.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less so.
A mandate at the Élysée is another mandate.
So the current head of state will be running in 2012.
But the obvious doesn't sit well with the mystery of the office of the presidency.
Then we must act as if the doubt still exists.
In one way or another.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The prospect of "two mandates" has therefore caused a bit of fever, as he mentioned it to UMP parliamentarians at the Elysée on Tuesday evening.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way from that.
The President was merely recalling that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's mentioned the presidential election in a humorous way in meetings like this.
"At worst, or at best, you have seven and a half more years with me", he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the next step".
His remarks yesterday do not make him any more qualified than the day before; they do not make him any less so.
If they do, it's for two reasons.
The acceleration of the PS candidacy race, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance of Ségolène Royal that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious, many in the PS are calling for a battle order earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP about it", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and cautiously.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not run", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", said Alain Juppé, who was obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to continue purchasing government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the arrangements for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the termination of a number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that are due to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis is forcing the Frankfurt Institute of Issuing Institutions to act more decisively, otherwise it will worsen the already tense situation on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the greater.
The European Council, which is to be held in Brussels on the occasion of the European Council's annual meeting, will be held in Brussels on the occasion of the European Council's annual meeting.
It did not say whether it thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts for my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more discreet about his intentions, merely stating that the programme of buying government bonds on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have bought up for €67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market operators that the purchases will continue (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in course.
The ECB has already eliminated loan transactions with a maturity of more than three months, but it still makes unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this to continue for a few more months.
"I can't imagine her making any major changes to her schedule".
"Otherwise, we risk creating new tensions in the short term", said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely", anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
Regarding its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of bond purchases to stimulate a healthy market", adds Bräms.
Given the size of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs substitute itself for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a surge in the yields paid by the most fragile states", a leading bond manager testified yesterday.
If interest rates soar, the governments will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not to stabilise it.
The saving of the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back on the
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased somewhat yesterday with the return of 10-year bond rates.
A return to the precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with longterm German rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of collateral for the risk of default (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing some consternation in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "very concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal", says Hudson Institute economist Irwin Stelzer.
The problem is clearly the lack of growth and the accompanying lack of tax revenue, which puts the State at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels has been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently being considered in the Senate is based on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (against the 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budgetary group which could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken", said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from the international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are sound, we have been saying that for a long time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian International Monetary Fund administrator in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its large debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are less than those required of other countries", observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There is the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, which could lead to early elections being held at the end of March.
This would be a very unfavourable time for decision making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider strengthening their anti-crisis capabilities
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris yesterday: 'I believe that the Europeans, as we showed again on Sunday, day and night, are clearly united, determined and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.'
Although relatively relaxed, the easing in European government bond yields yesterday gave the governments and the ECB a boost.
But we cannot yet speak of a start to standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it may downgrade Portugal's debt, the most speculative target today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which particularly weighs on banking systems", say the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
This is all the more so since 'political time is much slower than market time'.
Aware of this gap and the dangers it entails, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the already existing crisis prevention mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are proceeding well.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The fate of unconventional measures to support the euro area countries in the markets' crosshairs (see above) is on the menu.
The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) began its Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about developments in the European crisis.
If the purpose of the visit is not to raise funds, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first issues of the EFSF are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to more immediate austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to go a different way than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid calling for international aid before they have put their own budgetary adjustments in place and decided on the structural reforms needed to restore confidence on a lasting basis.
Finally, European funders are discussing the options available to accelerate the process of standardising sovereign bond markets.
The European Council also called on the Commission to take all necessary measures to ensure that the EU's financial contribution to the fight against terrorism is not used to the detriment of the people of Europe.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around €100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct cash injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which has, to date, 60 billion euros.
This is a piece of advice that is likely to be given careful consideration in the capitals of Europe.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
Snowfall still causes traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it is lightly snowing on the Ile-de-France.
Snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, occasionally 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is sufficiently large to cause traffic problems and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were banned from heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac lines.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take your vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transport has been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy airport and 10% at Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, were closed until Thursday morning.
The first financial sketches of the Paris Metro
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been pouring in.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion is being mentioned for the metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount that will then enable the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 amending Finance Act, which was considered in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the provisions for finding the origin of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, according to the text of the bill, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated that "the revenue from this tax is €117 million per year".
The second is a re-arrangement of an existing office tax "to modernise it, increase its revenue and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that be?
It's a mystery.
It's not encoded in the text.
We're not even close to 4 billion.
'It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of capital allocation which will be mobilised by the State and provided to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,' the explanatory memorandum reads.
At the GSP, we don't find this shocking system.
"Once revenue is generated (the two taxes, ed.), it is possible to cover the studies over three years and then to enter the 4 billion afterwards", it explains.
"It will be entered in the budget and drawn as it goes".
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion are still to absent subscribers, is likely to provoke a somewhat agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public hearing on 7 December.
Hackers and spies on the run
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal which appears as such only in the face of the hypocrisy which governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months ago could be read in any newspaper (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the sinister caricatural profile of Khadafi has long been for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of news that is already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will find that each book (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) repeats exactly what was already written in the previous books.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for information about the nonexistent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult believe only in what they already know, and this confirms what they have already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same goes for the classified files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in mind) is the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, I don't know, editor of Libération), who only holds as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the one Newsweek had published the week before.
Then why did the disclosures on these files make such a fuss ?
On the one hand, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of state can call each other or fly to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small representative exercises, have become centers of espionage.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that we pretend to ignore it.
However, the act of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is a significant blow to the State Department's prestige.
The scandal therefore does not put the victims in crisis so much as the "executioners".
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
Back in Orwell's time, you could think of any power as a Big Brother who controlled every move of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, being able to control every move through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as is happening now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- elected as the citizen's avenger -- can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold on?
It is true, as Georg Simmel has said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that anything we know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret void of secrets, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power from her.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too much harm to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power ?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any information online - it would be like putting it on a billboard on a street corner.
But it is equally clear that with today's technology, it is futile to hope to maintain confidential reports over the telephone.
Nothing like finding out if and when a head of state flew in and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know that my prediction is science fiction at this point, and therefore a novel, but I am forced to imagine government agents traveling discreetly in stagecoaches on uncontrolled routes, carrying only memorized messages or, at most, hiding the rare information written on the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in a single copy in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has brought back wired telegraph.
Whereas the analogue videocassette had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, the digital CD now only allows one to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macro-portion.
High-speed trains take from Rome to Milan three hours, while air travel, including travel by train, takes three and a half hours.
It is not surprising, then, that politics and communications technology have returned to horse-drawn carriages.
One last thing to note.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret embassies.
Now it's the embassies that are asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France is rigging its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (so-called fast start or early financing) made by the developed countries.
And the big French gadgets are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU played a big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, grand side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciated and appreciated for what it is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, 'new and additional' in order to ensure that additional effort is made without detriment to ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, took 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years in the form of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure in previous years or to the overall level of ODA.
In practical terms, the total amount of French aid to the developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), and France claims to be fulfilling its commitment to provide 'new and additional' financing.
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
Again, there are no rules and each person chooses his own calculation method.
Some countries, such as France, consider that 1 € lent is equal to 1 € given.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission-mitigation projects based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given away... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted as part of its commitments.
But France has no use for such reasoning: it "meets" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union which uses the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46% of this, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) meet their commitments with 100% of the donations.
In other words, while the vast majority of the European Union puts in 1 euro to meet its commitment, France puts in only 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
What a trick!
In short, in its financing of the fast start, France is committing a double fraud: on the one hand, on the evolution of the action over time and, on the other hand, on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it is able to make it appear that it is spending EUR 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if they just lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early financing chapter is a small, relatively short-term issue in the climate discussion as a whole.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting system for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial topic currently under discussion): the question of 'additionality' or the accounting of loans cannot be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore in the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of 'additionality' and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move the discussions forward.
Pesticide warning for children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a single day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the food usually consumed in four meals and one snack in a day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products, and one and a half liters of water a day - as well as treats, have been tested by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The list is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as carcinogenic to some and 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear from our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is a matter of concern", the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three confirmed carcinogenic residues as well as nearly twenty residues which may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide, which is banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
Furthermore, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread sticks and chewing gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
The tap water was tested for nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final consumer risk of these "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase of civilization's diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
