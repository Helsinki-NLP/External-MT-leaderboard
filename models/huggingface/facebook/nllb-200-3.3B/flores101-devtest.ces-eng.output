USA Gymnastics supports the letter to the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the overriding need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the United States Olympic Committee's statement that the interests of our athletes, their teams and the sports themselves will be better protected if we promote meaningful change within our organization, rather than if the organization loses official authority.

USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal  to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and supportive environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as his adviser and then for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
During the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy, then served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, where he replaced Henry Kissinger.

This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (a theory that is already widely accepted), but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed tail, called a rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - researchers have concluded that the rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or demonstration.
Scientists believe that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, it is a specimen of the adult animal's plumage, not the plumage of a juvenile.
A car bomb exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged ISIS fighter was behind the attack.
They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principle as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is apparently determined by their light, by their rotation, and nothing else.
Based on luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star is determined, which relates to the flow of the plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic rotation.

Hu encouraged developing countries to "avoid the old ways of polluting first and cleaning up after".
He added that 'they should not, however, be asked to take on responsibilities that are beyond their development stage, responsibilities and capabilities'.
The Iraqi study group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns of the impossibility of guaranteeing that any targeted activity in present-day Iraq will stop sectarian strife, escalating violence or sliding into chaos.
The report begins with a plea for open debate and consensus building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive branch's current approach to Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that before the end of this year a new diplomatic initiative should be undertaken to secure Iraq's borders against hostile intervention and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for a phenomenon caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force on Earth and causes the ebb and flow of sea levels, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is around the galaxy in some kind of osmosis and is made up of lots of small particles.
Television reports show white smoke rising from the power plant.
Local authorities are warning residents near the plant to stay indoors, turn off their air conditioners and avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered an extremely drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "highly disturbing, even alarming, because of its high virulence".
Dr. Moll thinks that some of the patients may have picked up the virus at the hospital, and at least two of them were hospital orderlies.
Over a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with TB still seems low; 6,000 people out of the total of 330,000 infected at one time in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare health agencies for next year.
Vaccination plans for delivery to historically most at-risk areas for this year were delayed due to lack of resources and low priority compared to other diseases.

Infrared images show how the temperature differences between day and night indicate that this is likely a cave.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal changes are not as stable as those of the large caves on Earth, which often maintain a relatively constant temperature, but this is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University, based in Flagstaff.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in the booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope, indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter will place the envelope in the ballot box and sign the voter list.
The French electoral law contains a rather strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have been made transparent so that voters and observers can prove that no envelopes were in them before the voting started and that no envelopes other than those inserted by the counting and voter's credentials were added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the entire process, and in the evenings, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were evacuating drivers from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was subsequently charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but witness evidence may be compromised because her photo was widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of the photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists may be walking on thin ice if they publish photos of even the suspects".
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of the criminal prosecution, has made it clear to journalists that no further information will be provided at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will be about a border dispute in which Palestine wants to maintain the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics seem to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for five years only.
The shooters were under close supervision by rangers during the supplemental pest control study as the studies were monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Sport Shooting Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the association's hunting program.
According to Mic O'Flynn, acting director of conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shoot have received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a move to move the country towards new elections.
The commission represented Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of the elections and some have been ongoing since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of faulty iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and four people dying from minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 plant-related accidents.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had informed it of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling the delay in the report by Apple "really regrettable".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Office of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady because she needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature births in his spare time.
His research has shown that when the hormone is administered, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lung.
The Sin-chua Agency said that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" containing flight records on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, and she died on a night when there were two moons in the sky, unique as she was, a strong woman, and she was the first to be killed by a monster.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said that Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more so... I loved her and I'll miss her... maybe she's somewhere better.
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who disagree with Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Chief Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, stated that she believed that at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
As for the extreme views in the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100 and 200 freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but his objections led to doubts about his eligibility.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to overcome the pain, because drugs are banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by several people in early February using various hardware and software, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water supplies to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the earth has formed since comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter" and "reckless".
There's speculation that he'll try for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel and carbon emissions every year.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more accurate information.
No emergency services will be introduced, no overground rail service will be built at Wembley, no parking or park-and-ride facilities are available on site.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have increased the chances that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the process took much longer, due to the interbreeding of endemic, intermediate, and immigrant cactus and cuckoo plumage.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes, and it can be rolled into miniature pieces.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be bent and spun, melted or pressed into sheets.
It can be worked to a considerable degree of thinness and fastened to other metal, and it can be made so thin that it has often been used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
And this is called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an indicator of it yourself using the juice of the red cabbage.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will result in a strange sensation and form a shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of a public bathhouse, where men and women used to bathe together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite to dial.
The satellite in space receives the call and then bounces the signal back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and visual field.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space, a large rocket measuring over 100 feet is required.
The bicycle changed the world in ways that had never been seen before, and the most important thing that it did was make transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cat-like predators, whose diet consists of medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats), whose diet is dominated by small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the ecological nick system, i.e. each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with the others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The herd consists of one to three related adult males, together with up to 30 females and young.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
Tigers can climb (though not well), swim, jump for great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same genus as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that can howl.
The tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar from a full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they have the chance, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than the ocelot himself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by smell, and they use their sense of smell to determine where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can move very quietly, hunting by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, when they cross a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe in, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set set set set up in the upper deck, meaning that nothing that crossed its path had a chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but they could have had a forked tongue, and their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a large dinosaur like T. rex was no match for them.
While most of their meals would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasting combinations, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called plush.
Another difference was that women and the poor ate their meals sitting on chairs, while the rich men enjoyed feasting together, leaning on their sides.
Ancient Roman food could not have included foods that had only been introduced to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which was open only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurates were built as part of the temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent out in the open.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas tell us that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there.
Although all countries were part of Scandinavia, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was drawn to a treasure map.
Although the document has a little inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text is on the bottom of the document, written upside down.
Although the author is not known with certainty, it is evident that the large parchment document (29 3⁄4 by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as an appendix.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles brought liberation to northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in what was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work in cooperation with each other, i.e. together forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil", and is related to the Latin civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and defines the size of a society in a certain way.
The forerunners of nations were city states. The culture of a civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and the proportionate spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government, with Congress as its only component, under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to tax, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it relied on state agencies, which often did not cooperate, to enforce laws.
Nor did it have the power to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states and could only be added afterwards.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic trials.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of them is Honshu, making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
In view of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes called an archipelago in the geographical sense.
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing nearby recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, thus beginning the transformation of the original grain production practices, employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the southwestern and northern coast of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was proclaimed a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main levels: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analogue film era.
They're still being made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratio has taken over the formats of digital camera sensors.
Although it is somewhat confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and ridiculed "rule of thirds" is a simple guideline that creates dynamics in a painting while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having gained wealth and power, became the object of scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over 1,000 years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain was crossing international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, which posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic met with only limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine military forces.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horror and cruelty of World War I, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor, his former supervisor.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Qin dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war was being waged between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the throne in the Great Palace of Sian.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, because instead of military ranks based on class affiliation, it's now based on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start revolutions in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of secular life, and he frequently visited a cave known as Hira on a mountain called Noor (light) and meditated there.
The cave itself, which has survived for a considerable time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual focus.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, because it's completely isolated inside the cave.
There is nothing to be seen but a beautiful clear sky and a great number of surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created as a tribute to Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The 'upside down' symbol looks like a letter V and the 'downside' symbol looks like a staple or a square with the bottom missing.
Top means you start at the tip and push the string, bottom means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the string) and pull the string.
Moving upward usually produces a softer sound, while moving downward produces a louder, more penetrating sound.
You can write your own markings on the sheet with a pencil, but keep in mind that printed markings have a reason from a musical standpoint, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the King's sister, Elizabeth-Philippe, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of marauders.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by an angry mob, shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal gang was luring the head of the royal guard in front of a horrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, with the interest on the bonds flowing through the Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
The extra surpluses derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, represent the basic income of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it's necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most scholars believe ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology push or technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by omnipresent logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an 'effect' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor vehicles appear, it inevitably leads to the development of roads.
But the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which is causing new medical techniques to be invented to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried within it a considerable element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically formed individuals and over time, there were customs and cultures associated with that geography that, because they were in accordance with the location of the society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its importance diminished during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders brought back to Europe valuables such as silk and spices, which had a higher price at home than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th, 11th, and 14th centuries.
Early dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
But because of slow communication, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of this era was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce only the amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximise yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership through the expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the meaning of socialization is to draw from several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, unfortunate accidents, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some werewolf children have been imprisoned for long periods (usually by their own parents), in some cases living in abandonment, as their parents rejected them due to their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, and then been abandoned or run away.
Others claim to have been raised by animals, while some claim to have lived in the wild on their own.
In complete nonhuman animal training, the feral child exhibits almost identical behaviour (within the physical possibilities) as the caretaker animal, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The framework is not a teaching method but rather an aid that provides support to those individuals who are undergoing the acquisition of new practice, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it's also a little piece of Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates virtual constructs to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that might be too demanding for the student himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that lacks proper nutrition, care, and education, but there are cases where this is the case.
We believe that the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care is to provide for all needs not met in the household from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and enjoyment.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivating factors for Internet use (James et al., 1995)
'Personal engagement' and 'continued interest' were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighme and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-signs  facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by interpreting micro-signs correctly, you can tell if someone is lying to you.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks noted how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to judge sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: latent and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blur the differences between the two sets in both directions within each generation.
For primates with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources that are available in the open savanna.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and death.
The most readily available plant sources would be the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for us, like for primates, to digest unless they are cooked.
By contrast, animal food (ant, termit, egg) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors were solving the protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock when you are asleep, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces a person to get up and go to the bathroom.
The degree of inner calmness of a person corresponds to the opposite of the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more good the life force brings, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that's standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple in their essence, and they are Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened by the postures of this yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and an enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. Conflicts of system, processes and culture led to the breakdown of cooperation between the countries at the end of the war.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really did fight with proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup forces along the Romanian front.
But these plans were foiled almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the soldiers invaded eastern Poland, violating the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the navy was to ensure the ability of the state to transport people and goods, but at the same time the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this operation, mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often under the care of shepherds, often of the child or adolescent age, similar to the more familiar sheep shepherds.
Horse racing tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage roads were generally made of parallel planks, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The rails were introduced early to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually found that rails were more efficient if they had a band of iron on their surface.
This became a common occurrence, but iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, with humans starting to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning man standing upright).
Their ancestor Australopithecus did not walk upright as a rule.
Bipedians appear in Australopithecine fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly lives, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
In many cases, it's the same as symptomatic treatment, but if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal because of man's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased as a result of overpopulation and man's extravagant life-styles.
Then, after being passed by Congress on July 4, the handwritten bill, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now called "Dunlap's prints".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and one copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, or 25 copies from Dunlap's press, the original manuscript of which has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to this day.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But the birds still have a lot of dinosaur-like features.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are represented as the binary digit  or in computer jargon bytes.
Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the insidious and the the insects are cunning, adapted to live in the nest or the home of their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of MS across the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to plan the adoption of their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the child's parents can become another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the guiding principle behind most scientific research.
But it's not experimentation per se, an experiment is a test that is used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research, it's also important to ask questions and observe.
Naturists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-contained oscillators that continue to run in a freely-acting cycle without the presence of external stimuli.
Hershey's Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the germline cells have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the relevant ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and in the meantime, they're passed by others who are heading to work to the place they just left.
Everyone participates in and contributes to this dynamic shuttle transportation system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely see this level of complaint about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is it something deeper?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a range; therefore traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to evade enemies and more efficient in finding food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, they're the only insect that can't fold wings, dragonflies and scales.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moves around the earth.
That makes sense, because it doesn't look like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the amount of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers to our oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,000 miles) long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size or technical precision.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were at that time more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's smallest independent country and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, humans have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because these elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be mined relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four aggregates of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there's a lot of elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and calcium are among the metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that have a small amount of non-metal elements in them, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil has become a good friend to many people since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new ways of writing, the pencil was relegated to a lower position and secondary use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens so they can't get in touch with the clipboard.
One can only marvel at what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
A fission bomb works by requiring energy to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and then by splitting the atomic nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is thick for about 70 km on the upside and about 100 km on the downside.
It's weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
The closer side may have more moon-like seas, because the crust is thinner, and the lava could have been more easily transported to the surface.
Content theory is about finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they take for granted during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two types of behaviour that can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues as peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, the person is transformed beyond recognition and feels like they have to change everything the team does and do it their way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success or failure.
This often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet on different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of the so-called 'invisible team' (Larson  LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
If all available resources are used effectively across the functional components of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be demonstrated.
As a result, the process of collaborating organisations to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
In order for an organisation to be innovative, its management must create an innovation culture, introduce knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and thus narrow and refine this research area.
Scientists are encouraging the link between brain disease and behavior in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that can help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connections to science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent action.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is embedded in a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every course, and a teacher would often like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual excursion sharing is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina create a website every year about their trip to the state capital.
Even blogs can improve students' written expression, and even though their blogging is often marked by sloppy spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "provides students with an overview of the world around them". The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and inspires students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs will 'enable students to improve their analytical and critical skills; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their view of things in specific topics' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lie Niagara Falls and further north, the beauties of Muskoka and beyond.
All of this and more underscores the fact that Ontario is a foreigner considered a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people will be surprised to learn that there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, can be considered a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are attached to France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these countries, and it flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all travellers should consider themselves married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should keep in mind that because of cultural differences, they may sometimes encounter harassment and that it is not unusual for a man to follow a woman, to take her hand, etc. while she walks.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences do not justify it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, and after the earthquake of 1755 it was abandoned.
The Moroccan sultan renamed the city Dar al-Badya, and Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of cotton goods, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out given the current state of fighting that continues to take place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for the Nyiragongo volcanic ascent and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla watching in Africa.
The usual price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, as has its airport.
In 1990, the desert sand was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television program Divy of the African World, hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in sharp contrast to the rest of the country, because it is more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the JAR's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there is an entrance fee and a nature conservation contribution.
The purchase of a Wild Card, which allows access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks, may also be beneficial.
Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which many tourists consider to be a major destination.
The view of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape is like a shimmering column graph reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best view of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the opposite coast, Kowloon.
The vast majority of the dense urban sprawl on Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is the place that was claimed by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest strip of coastal mangrove in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plains.
The Sundarbans area covers 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water bodies or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian Axis tigers can now be found in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is recommended that you buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses that are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (Number 150) and Punakha (Number 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 272 feet [83 m], the bridge is 1,300 feet [378 m] long, and it has two lanes that are 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the area now known as eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", came into existence as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
If you're interested in tournaments and where to get tickets to polo matches, look at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, but you may be able to use British and American currency.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make the exchange before leaving.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, it is summer here when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30 °C are common during the summer months.
Winters can be treacherously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with the wind and humidity, they seem to be colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific seasons of "rain" and "dry": the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to people, they are still wild animals in the wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park rules, stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Despite their apparent peacefulness, buffalo, deer, moose, bear, and almost any other large animal can be aggressive.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy foods and keep your camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of the infamous Naval Standoff of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with almost 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the independence movement organized by the Mau, a peaceful assembly in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, given that Auckland lies between two harbours, and the most popular beaches are found in three areas.
The North Shore (in North Harbour County) beaches are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located off the Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after Mission Bay and St. Heliers districts of central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide selection of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines you can have, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Drinking water from the tap is fine here, but if you're worried, bottled water is usually available.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A small black is an "espresso", a cappuccino is full of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive but top-notch.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Still, take the advice of the authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The four-horned lizard is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of Seventeen Seventy, and occasionally outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The sea crocodile does not live actively in the ocean, its primary refuge is the estuary north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance gives travellers the assurance that they will have a place to stay at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can be booked through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of airfare and hotel.
They can also help you make a reservation if you need time to think or to obtain additional documents for the destination (such as a visa).
Any adjustments or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the middle of the action, you'll need to arrive as soon as possible to secure a camping spot that's located near the music production.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival, the music may continue late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's position, as navigation through the ice makes an unbearable noise in exposed areas.
The St Petersburg round-trip ferry service includes time in the city.
Most casinos try to keep their guests in as long as possible and spend as much money as possible, and they often lack windows and clocks, often making it difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep visitors in good spirits and on the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the premises, but drunkenness affects judgment, so all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low, and you can't drive as well as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make you unable to drive.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or floating snow or by snowdrift or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many tourists, it represents the pinnacle of the entire journey.
The term safari, in the familiar sense, refers to a land journey to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to vehicles, and standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes larger, so you can better observe them with a telescope.
A tourist safari consists of a walking tour lasting from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at different venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the event in 1964.
If you have booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay is announced, this situation may be difficult for you.
The rules for cancellations may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellations did not apply to the July 2020 Olympic Games.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like to wear ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause clotting or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water takes only a minute, in others, several minutes.
Filters vary in their efficiency, and if you're concerned, you should buy water in a sealed bottle from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to their home regions.
A troublesome insect can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or, in worse cases, allergic reactions, the spread of poison, or the transmission of infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill a person are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other charges in the areas concerned.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when buying products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging for driving on the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, as it often passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: steep corners, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The maximum speed limit is considerably lower than in the preceding and following sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and its strict observance is even more important.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service here is far better than on some stretches of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, very similar to their southern neighbours in Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apples are used in the cakes all year round, and then cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and fox and other nuts, and the popular dessert often goes well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to taste some hearty sweets, try the desserts called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices, and meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to cuisine originating from the central and eastern part of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes many simple-tasting dishes, which are flavored with peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The reins on either side of the saddle serve as a support for the rider's legs.
They provide riders with more stability, but they can be associated with safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but his foot gets caught in the bridle and the horse starts running, the rider may be dragged behind.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole, which is relatively narrow.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety cushions that allow the three-point belt to fall off the saddle when the rider behind pulls.
Chochamó Valley  A favorite climbing destination of the Chilean prime minister known as the Yosemite of South America, where extensive granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The peaks of the mountains offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes, thanks to the endless potential of the walls.
Winter skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing or snowboarding on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a frequent travel activity with many fans sometimes known as ""ski hikers"", who plan their entire vacations based on skiing at a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old. cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, with the first recreational skiing club being opened in Nory, Australia in 1861.
Ski tourism: This activity is also referred to as cross-country skiing, ski tourism or ski trips.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although not part of that activity, the latter of which is performed in steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar tourist trail.
Under favorable conditions, you will be able to cover a little more distance than on foot  but you will rarely be able to move at the speed you would on a jog without a heavy backpack and with a modified footprint.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with a number of independent countries, and under normal circumstances, travelling through more than one country would mean going through visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area functions in this respect like a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, which saves you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what makes an object antique, but some tax agencies define antique goods as being over 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations where, for example, the age limit in North America may be lower than in Europe.

You may prefer to look to the advice of other governments rather than your own, but it is intended primarily for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is merely a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The views presented are often vague, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and takes various forms that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.

Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of all possible adverse weather risks in their area, as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for the term 'Hostile environment course' will probably reveal the address of a local company.
The course usually deals with all the problems described in much more detail, usually in the form of practical exercises.
The course usually lasts 2­5 days and includes role-based training, thorough first aid instruction and sometimes also weapons training.

Backcurrents are the returning waves that crash onto the beach, often at the cliff edge.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and that's where the fast current into the deep water can be created.
Most deaths are due to the fatigue of trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head for a place where you can't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, wait for help.
The return shock arrives earlier than the culture shock (there is a smaller phase of initial excitement), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have readily adjusted to a new culture often have a particularly challenging experience adjusting back to their native culture.
After returning home from a stay abroad, you have become accustomed to a new culture and have already discarded some of your home habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country must adapt.
What people may not realize is that even travelers returning home need patience and understanding.
The pyramidal sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show even begins.

In remote locations without cell coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite telephones are not a replacement for cell phones in general, because to make a call, you have to be outside, unobstructed, between you and the satellite.
This service is often used by shipping, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that require remote data.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
Increasingly popular options for those planning to take a year off are travel and learning.
It's especially popular with high school seniors, allowing them to take a year off before going to college without compromising their education.

Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The land of a thousand lakes also includes thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland  for every seven or eight people there is one boat.

Air travel can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight or if they've had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people have for other things.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help some people to overcome fear of the unknown or a feeling that the situation is out of their control.
Freight forwarders are well paid for fast delivery of goods. Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Some routes have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies have had problems.
If the items were sent by air freight, it might take several days for the items to pass unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to make this happen faster is to send the item as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most common way to fly first or business class is to take out a hefty sum of money (even better is to get your company to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: You can expect to pay up to four times the cost of a normal economy flight in business class and 11 times the cost of a first-class flight!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts on point A to point B flights for first or business class.
Airline companies know that there is a certain key group of travelers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and the prices correspond.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

The outward impression that Parisians are rather violent will quickly fade if you show even the most basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, especially with beech, spruce, or fir trees, and offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the diversity of its microclimate, diverse soil and altitude, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
