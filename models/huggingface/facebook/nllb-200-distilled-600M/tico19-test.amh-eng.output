Between January 1 and March 15, 2020, the overall incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) was growing rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area.
The overall incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, which is proof that the global COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly in all countries, despite varying levels depending on the country.
According to the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and high-level surveillance units should increase their preparedness in anticipation of a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare and especially high-level surveillance.
On December 31, 2019, cases of sambas infection with unknown causes were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause was Agent Novel coronavirus, known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
evidence so far shows that 80% of COVID-19 patients have a mild illness, respiratory infection with or without a fungus, and most recover.
In 14% of cancer cases, COVID-19 has progressed to a more severe stage and requires hospital bed care, while the remaining 6% of cases have severe illness requiring intensive medical care.
4% of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 have died.
In this study, we will compare the overall trend of COVID-19 in each EU/European Economic Area country and the United Kingdom (UK) with Hubei Province in China.
We have compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK from 31 January to 15 March 2020 with the case in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK
COVID-19 has spread from china to more geographic regions, followed by the country's current global COVID-19 outbreak.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global epidemic.
Spiteri et al. published in Eurosurveillance 2020 on 5 March reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to WHO case definition.
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020, with the men coming from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, there have been cases of COVID-19 in all 30 EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31/2020 and that date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths have been recorded in Italy alone.
Knowing the total number of cases and overall incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has reported the COVID-19 case numbers in each country in the world only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which are updated every morning at 8:00.
These data were used to measure and compare COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy.
As the presence of active COVID-19 cases is a significant factor, we have established a 14-day overall COVID-19 case record, taking into account the natural pattern of COVID-19 in each EU/European Economic Area country and UK from January 1 to March 15, 2020.
In addition, we have compared the number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020, 8:00 a.m. to the situation in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK
The trend of COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the UK over the 14-day period was followed by Hubei Province (China) as a whole (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the overall incidence of COVID-19 began around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28/2020 (support material).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown similar increases in the total COVID-19 outbreak (helpful material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom compared to the number in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have recorded a total of cases compared to Italy three weeks ago or less.
According to our results, the number of reported COVID-19 cases has increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK.
trends in the overall outbreak of COVID-19 indicate that the global epidemic is increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is happening as countries are at different stages, with differences in national community health responses, and possibly with different case definitions and protocols in different countries to select patients to be tested for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in the infected Italian states reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive medical care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those states could handle the situation.
Currently, data on COVID-19 cases treated in hospitals and/or intensive care units is available for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively, at EU/EEA level (data is not available).
However, they should be systematically collected to strengthen up-to-date monitoring data focusing on reported cases and deaths.
According to a 2010-11 study, there was a huge difference between ready-made high-care beds and standard beds in Europe, from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less access to healthcare than Italy (12.5 beds for high- and medium-care care per 100,000 people, in 2010-11).
Modelling conditions related to health support capacity integration are a concern for the over 90 patients in critical beds, with the estimated spread of COVID cases in hostels in each EU/EEA country and the UK, as presented in the sixth ECDC update on an immediate COVID-19 assessment.
With group cases in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK and hospitals and senior surveillance units often serving a specific segment of society, the statistics on cases and beds for senior surveillance should be published at the statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and other trends in other countries show that the global COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared to know that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to spread in the community and the number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare, especially top-level medical care, will increase.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Hazard Assessment suggests, a fast and comprehensive approach to slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is essential, changing from a stay-at-risk to a reduction approach, as the expected rapid increase in cases if not implemented early does not give policymakers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt to the situation.
Rapid risk assessment limits public health measures, which are intended to reduce the impact of the global pandemic.
The chances of countries slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and increasing their control efforts to reduce the burden on healthcare are short.
Otherwise, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will be flooded with patients requiring increased medical care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that was caused by severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and so far has infected more than 80,000 people in China and the rest of the world, killing more than 3,000, and has become a pandemic for humanity.
Like the same virus that caused SARS-CoV-2 in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from night birds and can cause similar symptoms.
However, although COVID-19 has a lower prevalence and mortality rate than SARS, it affects more men than older people and women than young people.
With the rapidly growing number of articles published on the new disease, this article will attempt to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing research project.
We cover the basic issues of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease.
although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help to understand and prevent the disease that threatens to cause harm.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has left an unprecedented and memorable memory for all Chinese, as Chinese have been warned not to leave their homes during and after the festival due to a new viral infection.
The virus is very similar to the 2003 severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COV), so on 11/2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 and the new disease was named COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in China and spread rapidly across the country, affecting nearly 50 countries around the world.
As of march 2, 2020, the number of cases of covid-19 virus has increased to 80,000, more than 40,000 patients have been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 have died.
WHO warns, COVID-19 is the number one public enemy and has the potential to do more harm than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the release of the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, infectious diseases and treatment, and they determine the order of viruses separated from different patients.
this survey will attempt to summarize the results of the research on a new and rapidly changing study topic.
wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other covid-borne diseases, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
we will discuss some other but urgent questions as well as what we have learned so far about prevention and the history of the disease.
CoVs are commonly considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, and are the 4th leading cause of influenza, accounting for about 15%.
However, we have experienced two major viruses of disease (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in this century; these viruses first appeared in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread rapidly to many other countries, registering a terrible rate of illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third recorded COVID-19 outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, cases of unknown origin of shampoo were first reported from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on December 31, 2019.
seven days later, kov's successor was released.
January 15, 2020, the first death in water.
meanwhile, the epidemic spread quickly to neighboring cities, regions and countries.
On january 20, healthcare providers reported cases of the virus, indicating the transmission of the virus from person to person.
on january 23, all public transportation in the city of wahan was stopped and the entire city was closed.
A first clinical study of the disease on 24 january showed that of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the aquatic seafood market, which is thought to be the source of the unknown animal infection.
On 30 january, the WHO declared the pandemic an urgent global health concern.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and about 50 other countries (Figure 2).
the rapidly changing situation will determine the final extent and severity of the epidemic in the near future.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study was conducted on 8,866 patients, of whom 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients showed the latest outbreak status (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but mostly those aged 30-65.
half (47.7%) of the infected individuals are over 50, while a very small number are under 20, with only 14 cases under 10.
The number of men (0.31/100,000) infected with SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in and around Hubei.
it takes an average of 5 (2-9) days to be diagnosed with COVID-19 from the date of infection.
The symptoms of the virus begin to appear in an average of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
the average time between onset and death was 9.5 (4.8-13).
The basic fertility rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases of the virus has increased significantly before 23/2020, the transportation period for the Spring Festival in China.
The number of confirmed cases of death was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main threats to COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe asthma.
CoVs are a subfamily of broad-spectrum viruses that contain a single class of RNA.
They can be divided into four general categories: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta cov are known to affect humans.
Envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the Sars-CoV and MERS-CoV from the receptor agingensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the diptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and then tissue fusion is formed.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is starved, the genomic RNA and envelope proteins of the glucoproteins and nucleocapsid form a virus-containing body inside or outside the cell, which combines with the plasma tissue to release the virus.
The first pre-determination report of SARS-CoV-2 was made on 10 January 2020.
When SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new type of beta-CoV, over 99.98% of the samples taken from the Hunan seafood market in the waters where the outbreak originated were racial similarities.
SARS-CoV-2 strain is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, Sars-CoV-2 particles have been detected in the narrowest parts of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2
However, the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 is linked to the human ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV, which is also linked to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients is less severe than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is secreted by the novel short protein orf3b and released by the orf8 protein.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b virus may play a role in the pathogenesis and may interfere with the expression of IFNβ, however, orf8 has no known active domain or catalyst.
On February 18/2020, Zhou and colleagues reported that the full-length human ACE2 is a 2.9 Å resolution of the cryogenic EM structure, which is a complex of amino acid transporters B0AT1.
They have confirmed that the open and closed complexes are reassembled as dimers and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which is evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may be a target for a drug-filter agent to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and distribution of the host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in nocturnal birds and were transmitted to humans through rabbits and camels, respectively.
By comparing the origin of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, it was thought that nocturnal birds were the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus was 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from nocturnal birds, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the median carrier of the virus that has crossed the strain boundaries to infect humans is still unknown, and its route of transmission is yet to be determined.
G and his colleagues suggested that the virus was transmitted from birds of the night to humans by snakes, which required reintegration with S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, found that long-nosed and frog-eating pangolins, mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on a 99% genetic similarity between the CoV found on pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the distribution of the 1% variation in both genomes is significant, and therefore, concrete results are awaited for substantial evidence (cf. p. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in dry environments, as well as for up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
Sars-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and 30 to 56 °C temperature; it can effectively weaken the virus without adding ethers, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing antibacterial agents, peroacetic acid, chloroform and other lubricant solvents, chloroxycin.
The general population is vulnerable to the new virus because of its weak resistance to SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, there are no detailed studies reported on the immune response to the foreign virus SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other covens, especially Sars-Cov and Mers-Cov (Fig. 4).
In general, the first known pathogen of a virus after infecting a host is through the pathogen-like receptor (PRRs) on the host's immune system, which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
The virus uses different pathways to cause inflammation, antigen storage, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), thus limiting the spread of the virus and accelerating the growth of viral antigen macrophages.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may help the virus escape the immune system.
soon, the immune response will join the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a vital role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to produce viral-based antibodies, while CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help immune cells.
However, cov can interfere with the function of t cells by accelerating T cell death.
Fluid-derived immunizations such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential to prevent viral infection.
For example, the antibodies that were isolated from the recovered patient made the MERS-CoV useless.
on the other hand, over-reaction of the immune system can cause severe damage to the liver and other organs, and in the worst case, can result in death, causing the body to become dysfunctional.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect older and pregnant women with various diseases.
It is common for people who are exposed to high numbers of viruses or have a weaker immune system to be more likely to get the virus than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with the most common occurring in the first 425 cases in water being 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, the most recent study showed that the virus's incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, based on demographic data on 8,866 cases.
It will be crucial for health authorities to adjust the effective time of isolation based on the most accurate time of reproduction, and in doing so, prevent the transmission of the virus to others from those who have the virus but do not show any symptoms.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to be kept in isolation for up to 14 days.
Should the period of quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The primary and first symptom of COVID-19 is fever, which can be seen without notice or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, swelling, headache, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhea and diarrhea.
some patients had experienced shortness of breath and/or decreased oxygen levels in the blood since the day the disease occurred.
In severe cases, patients may soon begin to develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
patients with fever and/or respiratory illness and severe fever should be screened for the virus beforehand, even if they do not have problems with samba imaging.
A population survey conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that the incidence of infections was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhea, and 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
similar findings have been reported in recent studies of two family groups and a group of individuals with a virus that was transmitted from a person without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 population survey showed that fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients.
However, 80% of COVID-19 patients need more respirators, given that the mortality rate in Mercer is higher than in COVID-19.
constipation (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in mercer patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms, and 14%-20% of patients needed respiratory support.
On 14 february, the COVID-19 death rate was 2%, and the number of confirmed cases worldwide at that time was 66,576.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For Mars, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, according to a June 2012 population survey.
According to an initial study, the SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high to 6.47, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 5.71-7.23, and the SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 is compared with Mars-CoV and SARA-CoV based on the sign, mortality rate and R0 in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but a lower fatality rate than both.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than controlling MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
group infection often occurs in the same family or group or in a recreational vehicle.
Patients usually had a history of travel or residence in the water or other areas affected by the virus or had direct contact with individuals or patients with the virus within two weeks of the outbreak.
However, reports that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms and that patients who have survived from the hospital can carry the virus again would be a warning to extend the isolation period.
In the early stages of the disease, patients have a normal or lower white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphonia with white blood cell count: 4×109/L including lymphocyte count; 1×109/L with higher doses of aspartate aminotransfer and viriemia 1,099 were found in COVID-19 patients.
In some patients, the levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood increased, while C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation increased in most patients.
in patients with a strong case, the amount of D-dimer, a reducing factor in fiber, in the blood increases and the number of immune white blood cells decreases gradually.
In most COVID-19 patients, chest radiography results showed health problems, with a manifestation of constipation on both sides or thick areas in the lungs.
patients often have regular diarrhea, severe diarrhea and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled body tissue growth, fluid flow, and growing wounds cause serious problems in the gas exchange.
Type I and type II alveoli cells reduce lipid and protein composition, increasing stress, and increasing the risk of seizures.
Thus, the worst chest radiography findings are often associated with the worst incidence of the disease.
The first epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 conducted on 18/2020 showed the presence of damage to the neuroplasticity, hyaluronic tissue formation, sambal infection and cells from the sambal from the dead patient, which is consistent with the study of viral infection and ARDS and is similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a laboratory technique called reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been a critical criterion for the detection of COVID-19.
However, due to the increasing number of false positives and the acceleration of the pandemic, clinical screening was started in China on 13/2020 to identify diseases (which will no longer be dependent on RT-PCR alone).
a similar situation occurred in the case of sars.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical demonstrations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential for an effective diagnosis.
February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group introduced a protocol to test SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique, which can detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies in microliter input) using a deep-link in less than an hour without requiring additional equipment.
If the new technique can be tested in clinical samples, we hope that it can significantly increase sensitivity and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, doctors can provide mainly supportive care for COVID-19, and will also test various therapies previously used or intended to treat other covid and other viral diseases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table 2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immunotherapies, steroids, patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
plasma from recovered patients was also suggested for treatment.
pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to produce antibodies to the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the soaps, while ACE2 is produced in small amounts by other organs, such as the digestive system and kidney.
however, respiratory failure and dysfunction are the leading risk and leading causes of death for patients.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives; general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, intravenous ventilation and inlet ventilation and mechanical ventilation are included in the weight of the smell.
patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal tissue oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiovascular technique used to treat life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and maintenance of immune function are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cause of cytokine storm is known to be over-exercise in the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytocin storms are characterized by a systematic immune response to the body's inflammation, which is the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause the cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which cause the ARDS and other body parts to stop working.
immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe seizures.
Corticosteroids and tosilizumab, which are anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytotoxicity.
Other treatments for cytokine storm include stimulation of T cell-targeted immune responses; inhibiting IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK disruption; blinatomobam; cytokine signaling agonist 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the damage to human immune systems.
However, high doses of steroids are not very helpful in alleviating severe liver damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
rather, it can have a serious impact on prognosis, causing serious side effects, especially bone tissue death.
However, short-term low to medium doses of corticosteroids are recommended for adequate administration to patients with severe COVID-19.
at the time of writing, there is no effective antiviral therapy yet.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was administered in a blood transfusion to an american COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed at Gilead, originally intended to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir was shown to inhibit the activity of non-single RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Gilead has submitted the compound to china to conduct combined tests on individuals infected with sars-cov-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baritinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as therapies for patients with severe respiratory problems.
diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur as a result of Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination therapy.
the link between these treatments and other medicines used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
similarly, blood transfusions have a long history of being used in patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat those with similar diseases or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
of course, patients who recover from the disease have a high level of antibodies compared to the pathogen in their blood.
Anboids are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes, which fight pathogens and other foreign agents, and directly exploit them by identifying specific molecules in pathogens.
Accordingly, plasma was taken from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
their symptoms improved within 24 hours, reduced inflammation and viral pressure, and improved oxygen intake in the blood.
however, until certain therapies are developed, confirmation and clarification are needed to suggest a method for extensive use.
some plasma-related damage should also be carefully considered, given the reducing effects.
for example, antibodies can inhibit immune response and cause life-threatening cytokine-resistant syndrome.
the amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the plasma requirement for treating patients is high.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce certain antibodies that can fight a global epidemic.
In patients recovering, it is therefore necessary to isolate B cells and identify the genetic codes needed to produce effective antibodies or to filter the viral proteins for effective antibodies.
in this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in china for thousands of years to treat various types of diseases.
However, the effects are primarily based on the combination of different components in a formula, which varies according to the TCM preference.
most of the effective components remained unknown or obscure, because it was difficult to identify and verify such components or their composition.
Currently, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the disease due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen pills have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The survival rate for COVID-19 patients was high in several states in China, where 87% of patients used TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninsha (50%) and Hunan (50%).
however, this comparison is shallow, as many other factors, such as the number of patients and the level of illness, must be included in the assessment.
On 18/2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone to combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed to recover body temperature, the time the symptoms disappeared and the time spent in hospital was significantly reduced in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM+TCM group alone.
Most surprisingly, the incidence of complications (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group (8.8% versus 39%) than in the WM group alone.
However, TCM will be expected to produce results of more controlled tests at a larger scale and more controlled centers for efficiency and safety.
The description of the steps taken and the explanation of the effective components or, if possible, their combinations of TCM treatments can also be of great interest.
patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are most threatened by a highly contagious and possibly fatal disease, and people in isolation are often left feeling isolated, lonely, and angry.
In addition, adverse effects of infection detection and treatment, such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, such as a lack of sleep caused by corticosteroids, can lead to increased mental disorders and anxiety.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various mental health issues were reported, including persistent strokes, confusion, panic attacks, mental breakdown, symptoms of mental illness, suicidal thoughts and thoughts of suicide.
Compulsory touch monitoring and isolation, which is one of the public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel confused and guilty about the outbreak, the results of the isolation, and the isolation of their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care for COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them and those in need in general should be provided.
The areas of psychological support to be provided include the establishment of multiple mental health groups, the open transmission of regular and accurate up-to-date information about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid contact with each other.
In addition to being critical to cutting the chain of transmission from livestock holdings and infected people to vulnerable hosts, effective vaccines are also useful in controlling outbreaks caused by new viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines that can permanently strengthen the antibody and/or immune system against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines produced from pathogenic viruses have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines on the elderly, models of reducing mortality and the validity of animal-borne viruses must be determined before clinical trials begin.
This may be because SARS decreased 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
on the contrary, the number of cases and transmission of mars continues to increase dramatically in the middle east, and in existing areas, it is transmitted from animals to humans and thus spread to other regions.
In the past, the use of non-mobile viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like substances and laboratory-derived protein subunits has led to the development of vaccination strategies for Mars, some of which have been tested on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and critical task in the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long time it takes to produce a vaccine (average 18 months) and the variability of the behavior of CoVs make it challenging to cope.
COVID-19 is a new disease, and the full clinical process is just beginning to be shown in thousands of patients.
in most cases, patients can recover gradually without compromising their health.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 causes severe illness and death in seriously ill people.
Therefore, it is essential to develop a growth prediction model for this disease so that healthcare agencies can organize their services, especially in areas with a shortage of care.
According to clinical studies reported so far, the following cases may be related to or related to the medical history of COVID-19 patients (table (table33):
Age: Age was crucial in identifying the history of SARS, and this is the same for COVID-19.
As mentioned above, according to a study of 8,866 cases, 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 years experienced COVID-19 primarily between the ages of 30-65.
The fact that patients who require intensive medical care are older than those with existing diseases and health problems and no existing health problems (average age 66 versus 51) suggests that age is a factor in estimating the likelihood of recovery for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 men, 0.27/100,000 women).
Recurrent health problems and diseases: COVID-19 patients who require intensive medical care are more likely to develop severe heart disease and respiratory problems.
problems with heart disease are the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be associated with ACE2-positive colangiocytes and may cause liver health problems in COVID-19 patients.
it is important to recognize that age and existing illness are highly intertwined and can interfere with each other.
Unhealthy laboratory findings suggest that the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the extent of inflammation or tissue damage, and that it may be used to determine the natural history of the disease, to respond to therapy and to the final recovery process.
The correlation between CRP levels and COVID-19 weight and growth predictions has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can help predict the effects.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various parts of the body, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
heart or liver problems are therefore common indicators.
The main clinical symptoms, chest radiography and the length of time of clinical symptoms should be used to predict the outcomes of COVID-19 and health problems along with other issues.
Steroids use: as mentioned above, steroids are commonly used as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the immune system and respiratory damage.
high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in seriously ill SARS patients, and many survivors suffered bone marrow death, permanent disability and low standard of living.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in small doses and for short term in COVID-19 patients.
Mental anxiety: as mentioned above, many patients experience severe anxiety and uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic due to prolonged isolation, watching a close family member and other patients die.
psychological counseling and sustained support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to current public health studies, COVID-19 has differing transmission characteristics from SARS.
In addition to its low respiratory rate, SARS-CoV-2 also multiplies in the upper respiratory tract and shows no signs of fluctuation or weakness in the first stage of infection, similar to other influenza-causing CoVs.
Therefore, people infected with the virus can produce large amounts of the virus during the first phase or in the first phase of the outbreak as a result of their daily activities, making the epidemic extremely difficult to control.
However, it has been shown that SARS-CoV is transmitted when patients are seriously ill and most of the transmission is not occurring in the early stages of the disease.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are underway in China to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including a complete restriction of movement in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the confinement of the general population.
While these measures are seriously affecting the economy and other sectors of the country, the decline in the number of new cases is a sign of a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most promising prediction is that the epidemic will end in march and the spread will decline in 3-4 months.
some experts, however, are not so optimistic.
According to ine paul hunter, covid-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
and ira longini have developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic, suggesting that sars-cov-2 could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples from the nostrils and throat of patients who had been discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the recently discovered virus, like influenza, could be a frequent occurrence.
However, the decline in new cases has shown promising signs in China, indicating that current strategies may not be effective.
Ebola was originally estimated to have killed half a million people, with up to one million cases.
however, due to strict isolation and isolation, the disease is slowly being controlled.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be a weak virus that weakens and dies in the process or that lives with humans and is not capable of transmitting disease.
A comparison between the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by straining or vomiting, as well as by direct contact with contaminated materials.
the virus has also been found in the throat, suggesting that it is likely to be transmitted from the throat to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases showed that 41% of cases were probably caused by a local infection, including 17 patients with existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
therefore, care must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and people who have contact with patients or those affected.
The first line of defense we can use to reduce the risk of infection is to make face masks; surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (product number 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets from passing through the air or from passing to others by sticking to the surface of the material.
However, only N95 masks (resolution number 1860s) with a size of 10 to 80 nm are able to prevent the virus from entering; only 5% of the microorganisms can enter fully through respiration; SARS-CoV-2 is somewhat similar to SARS-CoV, both being approximately 85 nm.
Since five surgical masks are spread out and can be submerged, small objects can enter, so healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should not wear N95 (brand number 1860s) and surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear self-made gauges to reduce contact with the virus.
viruses can infect a person's eyes.
On january 22, 2020, a doctor was also exposed to sars-cov-2 wearing an n95 mask, and the virus may have entered his body through his eye.
healthcare providers should therefore wear face masks or face masks that are transparent when working with patients.
for the general population living in infected or potentially infected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with soap and soap more than usual, to stay in isolation and to limit contact with people living at risk of infection.
people should be three feet away from a patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for the human world, the strong similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a high alert due to the severe memory of the SARS epidemic in China in 2003.
However, the director of the Water Disease Control Center remained until January 19, 2020, reassuring the public that the new virus is low in risk of transmission from person to person and has limited chances of reproduction and that the disease is not difficult to prevent and control.
This message raised the public's alert level, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the pandemic was still at a low level in the water.
disease control organizations in china can learn from this hard lesson and make strong improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public statements because citizens value every word and can change their views and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for regular reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more responsive to preventing an epidemic from happening; and (4) spend more time on targeted and effective workshops that increase public awareness of epidemics and allow for the timely opening and improvement of the voting system in the community.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, began in late December 2019.
in less than two months, it was distributed throughout china and in nearly 50 countries by the time this article was published.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense that SARS will recur.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to controlling the outbreak and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate is higher among older people than among young people.
The mortality rate from SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even without any symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus during a serious illness, making it difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 beyond SARS.
This provides a partial explanation of why SARS-CoV-2 has spread faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A standard RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
on the other hand, survivors may be positive again.
These findings significantly increase the risk of virus transmission.
As research on COVID-19 is progressing rapidly, several critical issues need to be addressed, such as:
Where did Sars-Cov-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and two nocturnal SARS-CoVs have been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from nocturnal birds.
What species of animal was the dominant in the transmission of the virus from the first carrier, the nocturnal bird, to humans?
without knowing the answers to issues no. 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the pandemic can strike you at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how does the virus enter the airway and cause disease?
Is the virus attached to ACE2 signaling cells in other parts of the body?
without clear answers to these questions, we cannot have a speedy and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus spread to humans reveal the growth of the breed?
Will it be a global epidemic, like SARS, or will it be a cold?
although it is important to find answers to these and many other questions, it may take time.
however, no matter the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
The origin of human coronaviruses
adaptation and adaptation have been the origin of the coronavirus and its carriers, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human covens (Hovens) were found to cause a mild flu-like illness.
The outbreaks of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown that HCoV infection is both devastating and life-threatening.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has led to the resumption of the focus of covid-19 and surprised us with its high transmission potential, but the incidence of the disease has decreased compared to its counterpart SARS-CoV.
Since echov disease is a zoonotic disease, understanding the origins of echov is very useful.
Many hcovs are from nocturnal birds and are not a cause of disease in them.
Some hskovets are also known as medium main carriers.
identifying carriers is directly linked to human disease prevention.
studying covid-carrying interactions in animals can provide useful insights into the transmission of covid in humans.
In this review, we will summarize the information about the seven HCoVs, the history of their origin, and the main sources and the interconnection of the data.
The important thing is that we compare different HCoVs based on the origin of the virus and the reassembly of the genome.
The current covid-19 outbreak 2019 (covid-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful carrier exchanges and the biological effects of viruses on the severity of the disease were also noted.
The coronavirus is classified as a group of viruses called coronaviruses, which are a group of covert, positive and single RNA viruses.
These viruses contain the largest genome of RNA viruses, 26 to 32 kilobuses, and are named after the Kovacs because their shape resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In structure, stage covets have genomes sharing the same structure that are not divided.
About two-thirds of the virus strains have two large open readers (ORF1a and ORF1b), and many of the proteins that are duplicated into pp1a and pp1ab are mutated.
Polyproteins are continuously processed to form 16 non-formal proteins, separate nsp1~16.
The rest of the class contains spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleotide (N) ORFs for protein structure.
Many variable protein strains are also recorded in various covid strains.
Based on the protein sequence differences, covets are divided into four categories (alpha-cov, beta-cov, gamma-cov and delta-cov), of which the beta-cov genus contains many hcovets and is divided into five sub-species (A, B, C and D).
Breed evidence suggests that nocturnal birds and mice are the primary source of seeds for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
for thousands of years, covens have repeatedly crossed the line of descent. some have been a major cause of human disease.
there are seven known human-attacking covets.
among these are hcv-229e and hcv-nl63 alpha-cov.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HQ, severe respiratory disease coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory disease coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HQ1 and HCoV-NL63 are common causes of mild illnesses such as influenza and/or fever.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the more recent variant SARS-CoV-2 are the most serious causes of illness, with infection in the lower respiratory tract in a moderate number of patients causing symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARDS) and extratropulmonary disease.
The first HCoV-229E sample, B814, was isolated from the nasal fluid of flu patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have found that HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 both cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the idea that infection from Hkovich will not cause any harm in general until the SARS outbreak is known has been widely accepted.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was the deadliest in recent history. It affected more than 8,000 people, 10% of whom are at a worse level.
ten years later, the middle east respiratory disease epidemic (merci) spread rapidly to other parts of the world, with repeated outbreaks in the arab-speaking world.
2019 novel hcov (2019-nCoV), renamed srs-cov-2, is the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, which affected more than 91,000 people and killed more than 3,120 people between march 3 and march 1, 2020.
The world must prepare for the forthcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as the alarm rings.
the seven hickov are from birds, rats, or pets.
Many data support the origin of all eczema from the night birds, where viruses are well adapted and do not cause disease, but there are significant genetic differences.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and around the world.
The study of the Kovč source gives us a theme for understanding natural history, the underlying pressures and limitations on the spread of species.
This may lead or facilitate the search for major, medium and reproductive carriers of SARS-CoV-2 with important suggestions for preventing future transmission.
In this survey, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origin, the distribution between species, and the causes of HCV disease.
The HCoV virus, which is a related and important topic to be discussed, is weakened by the more it is transmitted to its natural storage space, but becomes pathogenic after the spread of a new strain.
We also examine the evolutionary tendency of HCoV, where increased responsiveness is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The impact of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this context.
animal cloves have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first detection of HCoV-229E cell B814 in the nasal cavities of influenza patients, various coves were identified from various animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
seven echovens have been discovered in the past decade.
The theme of the history of the discovery of hchkovch is clearly laid out in the order in table 1.
The first HCoV-229E strain of upper respiratory tract infection was discovered in 1966 from patients' respiratory tract, and was subsequently grown in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
In patients with HCoV-229E and flu-like seizures, fever and cough, including headaches, dizziness, pain and sore throat, have been reported in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the spread of HCoV-OC43 was detected in a series of sequences in the mammalian system and brains.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of infections caused by HCoV-229E, which is not easily identified by the symptoms of other respiratory diseases such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and are widely distributed during cold winter months.
The symptoms of these two viruses usually last less than a week, followed by pain for two weeks.
According to a study in volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild flu.
very few patients with weakened immune systems have a serious lower respiratory disease.
SARS, also known as the informal SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, is the first recorded human-caused HCoV-SABIA outbreak in history and the ethnological cause is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first SARS detection as a European sighting was in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002.
SARS outbreak spread to several countries and continents, killing 8,096 people and injuring 774.
Each case, except for the fast-spreading ones, is estimated to be responsible for an increase in cases at approximately the highest level, with viral load levels of 4 to 7 days of gestation occurring on the tenth day of the infection.
The symptoms of early onset in patients with SARS-CoV include myelgia, headache, fever, cough and cold, and shortness of breath, dizziness and respiratory distress.
Lymphonia (low levels of lymphocytes in the blood), impaired liver function tests, and high levels of creatine kinase (an enzyme that flows out of damaged muscle) are common lab-related unhealthy symptoms.
alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophage have also been observed in SARS patients.
On average, 20-30% of patients require special treatment and respiratory equipment.
In addition, various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, and the kidneys can be affected by this difficult condition, which is exacerbated by the most dangerous side effects of cytokine, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus first appeared in a relative of the patient who had travelled to hong kong from guangzhou for a separate lung operation.
since then, he has invested enormous energy in hcove research.
In late 2004, a 7-month-old baby, Hkov-NL63, was abducted in the Netherlands.
first, it is widely distributed in children, adults and patients with respiratory problems.
HCoV-NL63 is a common cause of nasal discharge, blistering, fever, and bronchitis.
Another single study found a sample of the same virus from the nose of an 8-month-old baby suffering from cholera in the Netherlands.
it is well known in the netherlands, but it is spread throughout the world.
HCovitis-NL63 is estimated to cover about 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases, with the highest incidence occurring in winter, autumn and early September.
HCov-NL63: associated with a throat squeeze, also known as croup.
that same year: hkov-hq1 was a 71-year-old patient in hong kong who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis and was discharged.
In addition to hereditary lung and throat diseases, hkowitz-hk1 was reported to be associated with the worsening of severe asthma.
In a similar way to hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HQ1 has been found worldwide to cause mild respiratory diseases.
All of these communal HCoVs were considered to work well in humans, and generally have a low chance of causing highly pathogenic diseases; although for unknown reasons, they pose risks such as infectious subtypes of HCoV-NL63, the lower respiratory tract infection has been reported recently in China.
In general, these HCoVs become less lethal or pathogenic when they have the ability to transmit highly and persist in humans.
Mers-Kov was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia after a 60-year-old patient with a lung disease who had a renal failure.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases have come from the Middle East, second-order cases have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in 2015 in South Korea, where 186 people were arrested.
results show that mars is similar to sars, which is becoming a growing lung.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also suffered from increased renal failure, which makes MERS a distinct disease among HCV-related diseases so far.
More than 30% of patients with gastrointestinal, digestive and digestive diseases.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been recorded, representing a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for human children.
In mid- to late December 2019, many SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated cases were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
According to the world health organization, the disease has been named COVID-19 as a major global public health emergency, causing lower respiratory distress due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
As of March 3, 2020, there have been 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In Hubei, China, the mortality rate is 4.2%, while abroad it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes dangerous respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are manifested by arthritis, cell and respiratory tract infections.
some patients have also been diagnosed with smallpox.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms of the disease, and it can quickly lead to the syndrome of aggravated respiratory failure.
Although sars-cove and sars-cove-2 are very close due to their high nucleotide sequence of 82%, they are classified under different branches on the tree in their linear relationship.
SARS-CoV-2 is a minor pathogen compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is highly contagious.
There have been reports of unmarked cases of SARS-CoV-2 and this is likely to contribute to the rapid spread of the disease around the world.
The need to compare and compare SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals significant similarities and differences.
the initial growth and persistence of the disease is very similar.
Sars-CoV-2 follows the characteristics of six other echovens.
The severity or severity of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has the most common symptoms, including unlimited, mild, or no symptoms during community-infection.
on the other hand, although the ratio varies in some ways, severe COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows the phenomenal behavioural patterns of community-owned echos and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of Aitchekov in society.
In other words, it is not yet confirmed that the transmission capacity of Sars-Cov-2 will decrease after its stay in the atmosphere, as does Sars-Cov and Mers-Cov.
Finally, a similar Sars-CoV-2 to other HKovs can be found in a sample of the Sars.
While SARS-CoV-2 fistula plays an important role in oral transmission, as does the SARS-CoV case, it should be clarified in future studies, at least in some cases.
There is a strong interest in seeing if SARS-CoV-2 has a mutagenic nature, like the HCoV cases that have spread in society.
However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 features has a significant impact on the final outbreak of COVID-19, including the spread of the virus, the cause of the disease, and the continued spread of the virus after transmission.
All four human-derived HCoVs with mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
on the other hand, it may be true that humans are well adapted to these four echoloids.
in other words, both could be the epitome of the early hcv global epidemics.
people with severe chronic illnesses and chronic chronic diseases, which cause severe pain in humans, have been removed.
to allow this to happen, echolocytes produce a stockpile of metabolites that are resistant to the causes of sufficiently large constraints in humans.
In this case, the chances of people becoming fully adapted to the long-term and widespread spread of SARS-CoV-2 are high.
if well trained, it will be difficult to isolate the relationship between people or to stop other disease control measures.
For several years, four community-borne covid cases have occurred repeatedly in the general population, causing a common flu in immunocompromised victims.
these viruses do not require a primary animal storage.
on the contrary, the most serious causes of disease, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are not as well adapted to human diseases and cannot be stopped from spreading to humans.
they need to continue and reproduce in their carriers of pathogens and to look for the possibility of spreading suspect human victims, especially through one or another medium and carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-inherited HCoVs.
hickovits are highly contagious, at least for now, as they are spread in society.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-inherited eczema and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
it may be seen in the future that it is completely unsuitable for humans and can be transmitted to humans as a carrier or a carrier.
Before discussing the origin of hickovits, it is useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of hickovits' evolutionary, natural, connective and supporting hosts.
If the tips share a high degree of symmetry close to the nucleotide order level with the previous origin, the animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of the HCoV.
The virus is highly integrated with humans and is not widely distributed.
in the same way, the storage carrier holds the hcove continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and carriers of the hCoV or the parent virus.
on the other hand, if hCoVs are introduced into new carriers and transmitters before they enter the human body or into the human environment, they do not combine well with the new carriers and are often the cause of disease.
This carrier can be used as a zoonotic source for human infection and can play a role in rapidly spreading the virus and transmitting human infection to humans to increase the incidence of human infection.
unless the spread is moderately carried out in this temporary medium, hickov can continue to be a disease that kills the world's population.
on the contrary, hickovits can also adapt to their medium range and can cause long-term epidemics.
when this is the case, the medium carrier will be the carrier of natural storage.
epidemiological data have shown a history of contact with animals related to SARS main case.
The similarities between the two species are more similar to anti-SARS-CoV IgG, unlike the general population, the study suggests.
The larva and raccoon have been found in the wildlife market with viruses very similar to SARS-CoV, which originally looked like SARS-CoV.
this was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was registered after all the teeth on the market had been removed.
However, before cat-like animals were exposed to the animal market, it was reported that they were not SARS-CoV-free, citing that animals such as cats are medium carriers, not naturally carriers of SARS-CoV.
It is not possible to distinguish between different mammal species that transmit and aggravate SARS-CoVs, as 80% of the different animals in the market in Gansu have anti-SARS-CoV antibiotics.
these are non-transmitter carriers of SARS-CoV.
Breed evidence suggests that nocturnal birds and mice are the primary source of seeds for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
These nocturnal birds have been identified with an anti-SARS-CoV antigen and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other night-bird cloves share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new theory of human-borne pathogens in nocturnal birds.
Although several SARS-like covid-19s (SL-covids) have been found in nocturnal birds, none other than one category WIV1 is a living virus.
Human angiotensin is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor for the enzyme carcinogen 2 (ACE2).
WIV1 introduction was described for use as a receptor nightbird, a sample of the nightbird's larvae and human ACE2.
astonishingly, SARS patients are not capable of injecting WIV1.
WIV1 is the closest known species of SARS-CoV in the night-bird, with 95% of the nucleotide formula being homologous.
Although there is a significant homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 does not contain SARS-CoV direct origin virus and that nightbirds are not direct carriers of SARS-CoV.
The study of the strain of the virus brings together the MERS-CoV into a mass of the same group, bat cov-HKU4 and nightbird cov-HKU5.
Nightbirds cov-hq4 and merce cov use the same transcriptional receptor, dppp4 for viral introduction.
RNA-based RNA polymerization of the mercury-cove sequence is transmitted to the beta-covec in the opposite direction, occurring in Europe and Africa.
no life-forming mercury-cove has been found in wild night birds.
Merc-Cov and his close relative Bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide imaging.
so the night bird may not be a direct bearer of the mercury cove.
studies in the middle east, on the other hand, show that the arabian camels have a mercury-cove antibody, which is similar to the hemispheres of many african countries in the middle east.
Live mercury-cove, which is similar to the virus found in humans, differs from the nasal fluids of the Arabian camels in that camels are actually carriers and transmitters of mercury-cove.
It should be noted that in laboratory research, in camels that were tested for mercury-cove, there were generally mild symptoms but high viral incidence.
the important thing is that the infected camels release the virus not only through the respiratory system but also through the release of fungi, which is the main way birds release the virus at night.
However, the source of the disease, which has raised questions so far, is that it was not first detected on camels, and that it was transmitted from the male to the female or unknown, and that the presence of unknown species is thought to be the cause of the mercury-cove outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide resemblance with the nocturnal bird Cove RATG13, which is isolated from the rhinoceros aphinis.
Like Sars-Cov and Mers-Cov, the Sars-Cov-2 and RaTG13 sequences are so distant that it is difficult to imagine their relationship.
This means that unless similar covets are found in the future, the night-birds may not be a close carrier of SARS-CoV-2.
It is possible that the animals carrying and transmitting SARS-CoV-2 were sold and killed in the Hunan seafood supermarket, and many of the cases of COVID-19 have been linked to this, suggesting that it has been transmitted from animals to humans.
Recent studies on metagenomic strains have shown that mammals known as the least-threatened pangolin (Manis javanika) may be carriers of antiquated beta-covs that have been associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin cov genomes share 85-92% nucleotide formula resemblance with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are most closely related to the 90% resemblance of RTG13 in their nucleotide sequence.
In the pathogen category, SARS-CoV-2-like viruses are grouped under two sub-seeds, one of which shares a very similar amino acid sequence characteristic of 97.4% with SARS-CoV-2 binding end receptor (RBD).
Although the genome of the first image sequence is broad, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are distinctly different.
A previous study in infected pangolins found viral contagion in lung samples, which was similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
This study took various assembly methods and manual arrangements to work on the genome sequence, which contains 86.3% of the total length of the viral genome.
we can't deny that pangolins can be a SARS-CoV-2 transmitter.
However, due to the discrepancy in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between Sars-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the distance between Sars-CoV-2 and pangolin Sars-CoV-2 related beta-covas.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 continues to be permanent in birds, pangolins and other mammals at night.
However, a higher homology sequence is found in RBDs, and a higher genome sequence sequence is shared between beta-covas, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 that are linked to SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 binding RBDs (adjustable end-receptors) are highly similar to beta-covids and SARS-CoV-2 and are driven by a selectively deeply-linked evolution.
Counter-theory has looked at reintegration between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife species.
The fusion is widely distributed among beta-covets as a change pressure.
The decision is based on the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin.
The presence of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HKU1 was being studied alongside HCoVs, the most serious causes of disease.
According to phallogenic evidence, the two HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be the origin of the night waffle Cove, while viruses of the HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 families have been found in the rat species.
ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge Cove) has been found in three-colored nocturnal birds in North America, and has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, camels were identified as the median carrier, while HCoV-229E was associated with another nocturnal bird, the genus Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008.
to clarify, our understanding of animal hickovits is clearly shown in figure 1 and table 2.
paleogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the transmission of eczema by humans throughout history.
around 1890, when hchkov-oc43 transmitted the virus from domestic animals to humans, an outbreak of respiratory disease was recorded.
The distribution of HCoV-229E among species is not well understood.
The closest to HCoV-229E have been the bat alpha-covas.
among them is the alpha-cove of alpaca.
Many lines of data support the direct transmission of the virus from birds to humans.
First, alpacas (long-necked wildlife found in south america) may not be in contact with the nocturnal birds in the shared ecological environment.
rather, humans have no close contact with alpacas.
Second, the night-bird alpha-coves associated with HCoV-229E are distinct and non-pathogenic in the night-bird, while the alpaca alpha-cov causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alfa-CoV has not been detected in wildlife.
hence, we should not stop assuming that alpacas may have acquired alpha-CoV associated with hCoV-229e from humans.
In fact, the direct source of viruses that are harmful to humans, including the mad dog disease virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and the henra virus, are the nocturnal birds.
it is therefore not surprising that night birds can transmit hCoV-229e directly to humans.
Alternatively, the night-bird alpha-cowfish can carry and transmit viruses to humans, like the mercury-cow, alpacas and Arabian camels, while they serve as an HCoV-229E gene pool.
mercury cove can be used as a good example of a disease that is transmitted from night bird to camel species, from camel to human.
the origin of mercury-cove evolution was first identified by night birds, and has been confirmed by a series of discoveries.
It is clear that nocturnal birds form several sets of viral pathogens for the exchange of genes and transmission of genes.
long-term stay, mass gathering, close contact and strong flight skills are the best conditions for the spread of the virus.
merce-cow, on the other hand, had camels for decades.
It is well suited for these camels, which have moved from medium carrying to permanent and natural storage carrying.
the mercury-cove is moderately pathogenic, but it has a low rate of change in these animals.
The rare human disease is a sudden and uncontrollable disease, and people remain the carriers of this risk-taking agent until the spread is contained.
The share of camels in the Mars-Cov distribution is different from that of pangolins.
Pangolin beta-cloves are particularly dangerous to the health of pangolins.
They may be the last transmitters of beta-cores that interact with SARS-CoV-2, just like the genus in the SARS-CoV case.
The potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection from animals to humans will need to be monitored in future studies and then outside.
At first, nightbirds may be carriers of a virus that is contagious to SARS-CoV-2 and similar to SARS-CoV-2.
humans can share a few ecological zones with birds of the night by feeding animals or mining coal.
second, the newly infected pangolin carriers and viruses linked to SARS-CoV-2.
humans are infected by animals that they feed and feed.
many mammals, including pets, may be at risk of SARS-CoV-2.
Animal and wildlife testing for antibody purposes has been approved.
Third, as described above, the SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and adaptation process may have occurred in another third species of nocturnal birds and pangolins.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Unlike various animal carriers, the three main causes on the side of the virus are essential for the optimization of covid across the complexity limits.
first, the highest degree of comparability is measured in the RNA sample.
Compared to other single-combination RNA viruses, the estimated rate of Covac exchange can be classified as 2 in each location per year, with an average rate of ~10-4 replacements, based on the level of Covac adaptation for the novellists.
Covots have verifiable-reading exorboliculism, the loss of which results in a very severe change in behavior and inability to swallow or continue.
Interestingly, remdesvir niclothoid analogues are known to suppress the cove material, which is by maintaining these exoribonucleases and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
but the reproductive capacity of the covets is a million times greater than that of their carriers.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually higher when the covots are not well adapted to the wearer.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 with a high rate of sputum, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly lower sputum rate, indicating a higher degree of human adaptation.
perhaps: he may have already been involved with another carrier who is close to people.
in addition to sars-kov-2, it also includes mercedes-kov, which is adapted for camels with one saddle.
In my opinion, genetic drift vaccination and anti-virus are not successful with SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the extensive RNA genome in covaxes releases more plasticity in the process of behavior modification and reintegration, thus increasing the chance of co-evolution for organisms and creating a propensity for novel coronavirus to develop when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by several distinct reading frames and protein functions that are inserted into the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, when covid RNA is reproduced, it can replicate and replicate itself repeatedly and repeatedly by a special ""copy-selection"" method".
In a carrier that serves as a catalyst, the transition occurs frequently during the covalent RNA transition.
Largely the same full length and subgenomic RNAs can be reassembled to form new covets.
Natural regrowth phylogenetic evolution was found in hkovch-hku1 and hkovch-oc43 and hkovch-oc43 in nocturnal birds SL-CoV and batCoV-hku9.
In the case of the virus, the virus is transmitted by contact.
Alongside the three viral factors listed above, the interaction with the virus is another important and influential factor in the spread of the virus from the host species.
The Sar-Kov reintegration is taken as an example, which is evidence of selective behavior during the inter-sectoral processes.
Based on comparative analysis, a single SAR-CoV, made between humans and a genus SARS-CoV, can achieve rapid adaptation to different carriers, especially in S protein RBD exchanges.
RBD, which is generally found in Cove S protein, binds to the cellular receptor and is the most widely-selected antigenic receptor.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the S1 subunit of the 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to the ACE2 receptor for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD (Rebate-Based Resistance) is a specific animal that has the ability to detect ACE2 receptors, including nocturnal birds, lizards, mice and raccoons, allowing the transmission of viral signals.
Also, 6 amino acid residues have been identified as isolated from human and fungal viruses, and 4 of those exchanged for ACE2 receptors are in the receptor-adhesive domain.
SIVET SARS-CoV RBD (adjustable end-receptor) has K479 and S487T exchanges and has increased protein binding in the human ACC2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid converters can be critical to the transmission of the virus to humans.
The fact that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitting cells in the same way as SARS-CoV is very interesting.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 shows that the S protein in S1 unit may cease to bind tightly to ACE2.
In fact, the CREO-EM study suggests that this adhesive has a 10- to 20-fold higher interaction rate than between ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins in humans.
It is necessary to determine whether or not any other major receptor is needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Amazingly, Hkovich-NL63 binds to ACE2 but is with another S-body.
There are many other HCoVs, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
they have little role in successfully adapting these covets to humans after they have been passed from animals to the breeding population.
In addition to cellular receptors, the effect of dispersion in the hCoV species is influenced by other carrier strains and other factors.
The separation of these carrier proteins between humans and their natural primary carriers, such as birds of the night, camels with one snout and mice with long facial hair, can limit the transmission of electrons.
hkovets must replace host asylum cases and replicate host breeders for successful cross-breeding.
molecular determinants, yet distinct and characteristically classified in the context of viral carrier interactions are crucial.
The use of CRISPR technology for the analysis of the unproven causes and limitations of SARS-CoV-2 carrier vulnerability in the genome-wide can be useful.
Novel Hkovich's rise: Back to the beginning
The diversity of nocturnal birds creates a high chance of occurrence of novelty cows.
in this case, the night-bird cloves serve as a nesting site for the eczema.
In addition, rapid change and racial reintegration serve as two stages in the process, determining the HCoV pathway.
for example, the identification of novell proteins has a high potential to alter the status of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV utility proteins, ORF8 was found to be essential for human adaptation, which is different from SARS-CoV-related nocturnal birds, but was found to introduce different ORF8 proteins.
The loss of SARS-CoV-29 nucleotide characteristics was found in efforts initiated during the human pandemic.
This deletion creates a customized reproductive culture by dividing ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have historical links to the sulfur and gamma-CoVs covets, because the micro-compounds are found in RNA-refugee RNA-polymers.
Re-interfaces have also been found in nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14 units.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak was a phenomenon of reintegration among the different strains of the coronavirus in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reintegration events have been observed in other hCoVs, where hCoVs reintegrate their shapeless genes with other animal covenants.
The most careful approach is to avoid the spread of the virus, especially in the case of a strongly transmitted immune system, which can lead to an unpredictable outbreak of the virus in the form of selective pressures.
One example of these side effects is the reduction in the full length of the ORP4 by the HCoV-229E prototype stress, which means that two nucleotides are missing.
ORAF4 has been identified as a virus of the nocturnal bird and camel associated with HCoV-229E, which has shown the introduction of alpha-CoV single nucleotide due to a mutation in the membrane.
The final evolution of the Novell HCV is also driven by selective pressure in storage carriers.
night birds are not visible or small when they strike at the cova; they are a sign of the harmony between night birds and cova.
nightbirds have been shown to be physically and physically adapted to covid.
For example, the night bird watch reduces the risk of covid-caused disease because it does not show any pre-existing symptoms.
On the other hand, the most important sign of hystocompatibility in complex stage I molecules is low level, as the upper end of the natural killer receptor NKG2/CD94 is inhibited by the stress on the naturally-killing cell functions in nocturnal birds.
In addition, the metabolic activity of higher nocturnal birds, caused by increased oxygen reactions (ROS), may not exert a significant influence on the metabolism of the covid or impair the re-reading of exoribonucleus, thus causing severe disease when the selective pressure of the virus generation is transferred to the host.
More pathogenic covid scales can also grow in synthesis, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein detectors to adapt to the carrier.
so, the three novels hkovs have not happened by chance in the last two decades.
CoVs are not immune to disease or cause mild symptoms in their primary carriers, such as birds and camels.
they also starve without resistance to a strong carrier disease.
The mystery continues as to why the disease-free carriers appear and why they cause serious cases of human infection.
severe symptoms are most commonly seen in areas where the immune response is highly active and strong, with high levels of cytokine, which, as they become more severe, exacerbate lung damage.
In contrast, the immune response in signal carriers was lower than that of covid.
The same method of resistance-response clearance may have beneficial effects for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
interferon reactions are strong in contrast to nightbirds.
Therefore, the management of type I interferon should be useful at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the onset of NRP3 inflammasome is absent in nocturnal birds.
In this case, NLP3 inflammatory storage from MCC950 grams could be used to treat COVID-19.
The origin of sars-cove and mars-cove in general followed the origin of sars-cove-2.
Beta-Covs nocturnal birds have SARS-CoV and 95% share nucleotide sequence, while SARS-CoV-2 has 96% share nucleotide sequence.
but the marketplace teeth and other animals have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 and have not been identified as closely transmitting SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-covets have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolin beta-covets may be the closest to the carrier or may be the last to absorb the SARS-CoV-2 gene product.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed or accidentally created.
Kovč has returned to the spotlight with the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of cocovitis in birds and other animals at night has significantly changed our understanding of the origins of the disease and the importance of animal carriers in human transmission.
Sars-Cov, Mars-Cov and Sars-Cov-2 have been proven to be the origin of the night-bird and transmitted to humans by medium carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection had been caused by human and dental contact in the marketplace, the markets would have been closed and dental workers killed, the SARS-CoV epidemic would have stopped.
In the same vein, considering the presence of several strains of pangolin beta-covids closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent the transmission of zoonitis (pathogen to human).
However, future studies may confirm how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other animals.
on the other hand, the mercury-cove was long in the body of a single camel.
camels are used for transportation, meat, milk, wool and leather products for the local community.
They are widespread from the middle east to africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to protect Merson, as in the wildlife market in China, to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
to stop the recurrent outbreak of mercury, it is necessary to follow a comprehensive approach and, in conjunction with other infection control measures, to obtain effective vaccines against mercury-cove infection in camels.
because we can't eliminate these viruses, new strains of infectious diseases can emerge.
various zoonotic coves are moving in the wild.
the night-bird cloves, which are especially susceptible to disease, are very different.
There is a good chance that these zoonotic covets will be transformed and reassembled, and that new covets will become highly contagious and/or fatal to humans in the future.
In some areas of China, wildlife must be avoided for food to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Given the dangers of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, high preparation and early treatment are required.
In fact, many viruses have been around the planet for a very long time.
they remain in their natural state until conditions are favorable for their distribution.
although nightbirds have a good chance of transmitting viruses, contact with birds and other wildlife is reduced if people know to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of covid and their natural carriers, which proves its importance in preventing transmission of disease from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
to summarize: the most effective way for humans to prevent the origin of pathogens is to avoid the natural environmental source of pathogens.
Many details are highlighted in the SARS-CoV-2 hypothesis.
If the night bird SARS-CoV-2 transmits to the pangolin, studying the similarities between the night bird and the pangolin is needed.
secondly, if night birds play a more direct role in human transmission of the virus, it should be known how humans can be contacted by night birds.
third, if a third mammal is a true transmitter, it should be clear how it interacts with other species, including humans, nocturnal birds and pangolins.
Finally, infection monitoring and research should be carried out, as many mammals, including pets, are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
whether it is a nocturnal bird, pangolin or other animals, SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses are expected to form a natural carrier.
Continuing research in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with suggestions for preventing and controlling COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the test requirements for suspected case and unconfirmed case of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance on how to diagnose and treat 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and this guide provides our experience and provides a good reference for fighting the pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and with ongoing research and clinical practice practices, our knowledge and awareness are gradually increasing, so diagnostic and treatment strategies continue to be up to date.
In this letter, we responded to our comments on our guidelines and presented the new testing standard according to the latest diagnostic tests and medical guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) according to the new diagnostic guidelines and the new guidelines issued by the People's Republic of China Public Health Committee.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was renamed severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On march 11, 2020, the world health organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a quick advice guide and published it online by Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
it has attracted much attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on current research findings and clinical practice practices, so diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being improved.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and medical guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), U.S.A. have been published in a total of seven editions between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, with some contexts significantly changed.
Now that our guide has received feedback from less than one, they have proposed a simpler outcome based on their clinical experience.
their work provides new evidence for our guidance and provides valuable value for this global pandemic.
we support and express our gratitude for this vital work.
However, their work also needs updating in accordance with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (test version seven) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 32020), the suspect case must meet three clinical epidemiological histories, unless it is clear that two clinical profiles need to include two items to conduct a comprehensive examination:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or presence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days of the onset of the disease, or other COVID-19 cases reported; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with aluminic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities related to COVID-19 within 14 days of the onset of the disease; (4) history of contact with a collection of confirmed cases (i.e. at home, office, school, etc.) in small areas, within 2 weeks of the onset of the disease (≥ 2 KK)
Clinical profiles: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with key diagnostic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells showing normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts during the first stage.
The verification of the case must be based on the following suspected case: 1) positive for SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR test; (2) overall viral genome sequence with high response to the known novel coronavirus; (3) serum test positive for specific IgM anti-human and IgG anti-human for SARS-CoV-2 in a mass test, or a change of IgG antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or more than 4 times the rate of severe over-reaction.
Nucleic acid can be seen in the respiratory or blood samples real-time PCR test for the second (January 182020) and third (January 222020) issues.
The blood sample was included in the fourth (January 272020) and fifth (February 82020) issues.
These adjustments, based on the researchers' ongoing work, are a good tool for rapid detection of nucleic acid, and can be used to add samples from respiratory organs, including blood samples, and to produce a unique positive antibody effect in a proven standard.
in addition, there is more and more information that warns us to be wary of patients who have or do not have natural symptoms.
Therefore, since people without clinical symptoms are classified as a minor threat, the Zhou et al. process table needs to be revised.
The outcome system must also be verified in clinical trials and studies.
to conclude, there is direct evidence and we invite readers to comment.
We recommend that you follow and obey new guidelines in your home countries to investigate unanticipated cases and unconfirmed allegations.
our team updates our guide to help regularly.

Shops in Australia lowered the limit of toilet paper for one sale
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chain stores Wellworth and Coles lowered sales limits to two and one pack for a single sale of toilet paper in all stores nationwide.
ALDI One Pack has introduced a limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted on directories and Facebook links.
It has been reported that consumers have been storing goods due to fear of COVID-19 and the possibility of isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths downloaded home toilet paper/software purchases into a package with orders.
These changes followed the previous four-volume exchange limit introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Calls said in a press release on March 8 that many stores are still selling within an hour of shipment, and demand has never been seen before, calling ALDI unexpected in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesman last week, sales have increased significantly.
Costco store in Canberra has cut the allowable amount to two packages last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of deliveries; Walworth ordered more ready-to-sell items, and ALDI has already scheduled special sales for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retailers' Association, complained that retailers want to increase sales, but that the local council's restrictions on truck delivery times have made it harder.
It expects the cost of production to decrease while suppliers and other suppliers wait for the flags to arrive.
ALDI announced on Monday that some warehouses will not hold a special day on Wednesday following the release of stock.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said the stores are filled with ready-to-sell items every night.
toilet paper is a large item, which makes it available in small numbers in stores and when sold, creates a large open shelf space, which creates a sense of scarcity.
"The idea of Coles and Woolworths is that if there are more items on the shelf, they can buy a sanitiser and a towel for cleaning and reduce the stress of the shelf", Russell singled out, according to ABC.
The crumbling recycling toilet paper manufacturer said last Wednesday that its stock would run out.
Kimberly-Clark, Knex Toilet Software, and Solaris Paper, which operates a garbage collection, said they will work 24/7 to support supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Real estate website Domain.com reported that some property sellers in Melbourne are offering free toilet paper/software to the first bidder on the auction, as few auctions are held as buyers are on holiday on a few auction days.
The Thursday edition of NT News, published daily by Darwin, included an eight-page entry for scrolling and toilet paper.
The stores were initially unwilling to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry cleaning products, hand washing and powder, are in high demand.
Similarly, the British online supermarket Okado outside Australia announced on Sunday that the Andres Shrine will sell only 12 prisons.
The world health organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) now declared the spread of COVID-19 as a global epidemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
The word panemic is not just about how severe a particular case is, but how severe the disease has spread.
"all countries can still change the course of this pandemic".
"The World Health Organization's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that "if countries investigate, treat, isolate, search and find answers from the public".
the seriousness of the disease is so serious that we pay close attention to the proper response.
"According to the former US Director of Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, the outbreak was described as ""unprecedented"".
"In comments published by CNN in February, he said, ""No other respiratory virus has been reported since the outbreak until the next global outbreak, except influenza".
"Gretel Jesus has expressed the same view that we have not seen an outbreak like the coronavirus".
"Next, he said, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time before".
The new situation follows the World Health Organization's decision to declare the spread of a global pandemic threat a public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fusi, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the spread of the disease is becoming more severe in the community.
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
2019-20 coronavirus outbreak is the 2019 (COVID-19) coronavirus outbreak that is caused by the severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The pandemic was declared a global public health emergency in Beijing, China, on December 30, 2019, and declared an epidemic on March 11, 2020.
On april 10-12020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
about 364,000 people were cured.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, and 13.04% in Algeria and 0.08% in New Zealand for the rest of the world.
the main symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
complications include pneumonia and acute depressive syndrome.
the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but this can range from two to fourteen days.
there is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment for this.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended precautions include hand washing, covering the nose when coughing, keeping away from others, and self-monitoring and isolation for people who think they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, time limits, workplace hazard controls, and closure of facilities.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic stress, the delay and cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and a massive supply shortage due to shocking demand.
In 193 countries, local or international schools and universities have closed, affecting almost 99.4% of the student population.
The online distribution of accurate data on the virus has led to hatred and isolation of citizens from China, South and East Asia and other countries with the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Yubei), announced the emergence of an unknown pneumonia case on 31 December 2019 and initiated the investigation in January 2020.
Most of the incidents are related to the Huanese seafood wholesale market, and the virus is thought to have zoonotic origins.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the nocturnal bird coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms was diagnosed with the disease on December 1, 2019 and the individual has no apparent association with the wet market category.
At the beginning of December 2019, two thirds of the cases were market-related.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post reported that the first case, back to November 17, 2019, was found in a 55-year-old man living in Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that new cases in China were declining and, conversely, began to rise sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
there may be many minor cases, especially among mild cases.
On April 26, fewer cases were reported among teenagers under the age of 19, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, chief UK science adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before they could feel effective in fighting the disease.
cases refer to people who have been tested for COVID-19 and those whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
On 23 march, no country had more than 3% of its population tested, and many countries, such as italy, the netherlands, spain, and switzerland, had official guidelines for only mild symptoms.
According to a study published on 16 march, about 86% of COVID-19 cases in china were unrecognized as of 23 january. these unrecorded cases are the source of the 79% of cases.
statistical analysis published on 30 march estimated that the number of cases reported in italy is higher than the number recorded.
The initial estimate for the baseline reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that 5.7 may be the number.
most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't know, the average time to die from a symptom is 6 to 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of april 10, 2020, there have been approximately 97,000 deaths related to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of all recorded deaths in China were over 60 years old, and 75% had existing blood transfusions and diabetes. The official death rate from COVID-19 generally refers to people who died positive for COVID-19 according to official protocols.
COVID-19 deaths can be higher, not including those who die at home, from a family doctor, etc.
In Italy, partial data showed that the number of unemployed deaths during the global pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official number of COVID deaths.
"We know that [the reported death toll] is estimated to be low", a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson said, adding that "those under-reported reports in the U.S. occur occasionally during the pandemic, as in the case of H1N1 swine flu transmission in 2009. The first confirmed case of death was reported on January 9, 2020".
The first deaths in mainland china occurred on february 1 in the philippines, and the first deaths outside asia occurred on february 14 in france.
On 28 january, more deaths were recorded outside china in iran, south korea and italy.
On March 13, it said that more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by location, but over time, they are pressured by the number of tests scheduled, the quality of healthcare, doctors and management, the time since the outbreak and the population's age, gender and overall health. The mortality and case ratio is shown by dividing the number of deaths among the number of people in a given time frame.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-related death rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
the number varies from region to region.
In China, the case-by-case mortality rate has decreased from 17.3% (in the U.S. for those with symptoms from January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (in the U.S. for those with symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the case-by-case mortality rate (CFR), which represents a percentage of the number of people who have been diagnosed with the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which represents a percentage of the number of people who have been diagnosed (tested and untested) with the disease during their lifetime.
these statistics are not limited to time, and a specific population is followed if it is infected through a specific case process.
several scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
Based on Oxford University's evidence, the Health Centre estimates that the mortality rate from the pandemic could be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The first estimate for this range is a statistical study of COVID-19 testing in Germany and CFR estimates.
WHO has announced that the outbreak is controllable.
it is not only difficult to say with certainty the extent and duration of the epidemic, but it can vary from place to place.
The Marquis Penn State University-designed virus remains the same and the infection epidemic remains the same.
but it is unlikely that this will happen.
"China's top medical adviser, Zhang Nanshang, will be pleased that if all countries act to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to curb the spread of the virus, it can "stop by June".
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of London's Department of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 "is repeated for a year or two".
"According to a study led by Neil Ferguson, such as Imperial College, body removal and other measures are needed until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: 'This coronavirus is so easily transmissible that it's hard to say it will disappear completely, and I think it can come back every year and turn into a seasonal disease.'"
recovery damage is determined by joint immunity and DNA modification.
symptoms of covid-19, in contrast, may be unusual and symptoms may not be visible in infected individuals.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Minor common symptoms include fatigue, acute respiratory distress, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremors, vomiting, coughing up blood, diarrhea, or skin ulcers.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergencies as shortness of breath, chronic chest pain or pressure, sudden dizziness, difficulty walking, and facial or lip palpitations, and recommends immediate medical attention if these symptoms appear.
Some of those infected may have no symptoms, no clinical signs, but the results of the test show a confirmed infection, researchers suggest that people who have had contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to eliminate the infection.
Chinese estimate the number of uninsured people in the world from a few to 44 percent.
The typical time of reproduction (the time between infection and symptom onset) is in the range of one to 14 days, usually five days. For example, with uncertainty, the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell first dropped to 30% and then to 15%.
details of how the virus is transmitted are still to be revealed.
The disease is transmitted mainly through close contact and small droplets during carving, breathing, or speaking, with close contact being 1-2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
studies have shown that uncovered cough can produce moisture ranging from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people conclude that the virus can be transmitted by droplets that can be generated during speech and that these droplets can remain in the air for long periods.
they may lie on the nose or nose of nearby people or be attracted to the lungs.
cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can expose the respiratory system to diseases transmitted by the liver.
contaminated surface, including skin, can spread when someone touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
although there is a risk of transmission through the urethra, this risk is very unlikely.
The Chinese government denies that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by mouth. The virus is most transmitted in the first three days, even if it has no symptoms and can spread through the mouth.
people were diagnosed with the disease three days before the onset of symptoms, which showed that the disease could be transmitted before the onset of symptoms.
very few confirmed cases were reported in the laboratory, but similar cases were detected when they were tested in other countries for similarly non-Nicki.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has said it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spread, whether an individual transmits the disease to two to three individuals.
On polypropylene and 304 stainless steel, the virus can last up to three days, on copper, up to four hours.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have also been tested positive for COVID-19.
there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but british authorities recommend washing hands after touching animals just as after someone touched the floor.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus of severe respiratory disease, initially isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the category of severe respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of novel SARS-CoV-2 occur in nature with associated coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus kills soap at home, because soap removes the immune system from the virus.
the zoonotic origin is thought to be.
Genetic testing shows that the coronavirus is genetically classified into two strains of the genus betacoronavirus, subgenus serbecovirus (lineage B) and other strains of the yellow waffle.
The genome level is 96% similar to that of another nocturnal bird coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolins and human viruses.
The total genome comparison so far has found that about 92% of the genetic material is shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to confirm that pangolins are medium carriers.
The infection caused by the virus can be treated according to the symptoms, but is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
A study in Wuhan that compared PCR to CT showed that CT is more prone to exposure than PCR, but that it has a slightly lower visual clarity compared to other lung cancers and disease processes.
As of march 2020, the american college of radiology city recommends that it not be used for testing for covid-19 or as a first-line test.
The World Health Organization issued its first guidelines for the RNA testing process for SARS-CoV-2 research on 17 January.
The test uses real-time counter-clockwise polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
the test can be performed on the respiratory system or a blood sample.
the results are usually within a few hours to a day.
The test is usually performed by extracting the inside of the nose and a throat swab. Many laboratories and organizations are preparing serological tests to identify antibodies.
As of 6 april 2020, none of these have been approved for widespread use.
The serological test, developed by Celx in the US, has only been approved by approved emergency laboratories.
Radiographs and computed tomography (CT) and the behavior of people with the mark are a fluid between non-shaped and non-shaped glass and a fine powder.
The Italian Radiological Society is working on an international online image database that shows verified events.
Due to the prevalence of other infections such as adenovirus, the limitation on identifying COVID-19 with unverified PCR images is limited.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and, although the image shows little difference to the disease, considered it as a faster and more careful, epidemic screening tool.
Artificial intelligence - Neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been designed to detect the viral content via radiographs and CTs.
general techniques for transmitting the disease, including good hygiene, hand washing, keeping unwashed hands from touching the eyes, nose or nose and rubbing and flushing the soap and throwing the soap directly into the garbage can.
people who have already been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask before going to a public place.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. Many governments have banned or advised against all unnecessary travel to and from countries where the spread has spread.
However, the virus has reached a point of spread in communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how the infection has been transmitted. It is recommended that healthcare providers who care for a potentially infected community take regular and standard precautions, touch precautions and eye protection.
The use of local data on government mobile phones for this purpose has raised personal concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 organisations calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Many mobile applications are about to be launched in flagship, and many experts are waiting for April 7, 2020, to get another cable using Bluetooth.
If users are close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, they get a message. Misconceptions about how to prevent infections are spreading, such as, washing the nose and mouthwashing are not effective.
Although many organizations are working to create, no vaccine has been developed for COVID-19.
hand washing is recommended to reduce the spread of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or washing their hands openly, before eating, and after touching, cutting, or tearing their nose.
the virus dies outside the body by washing with soap.
The CDC recommends using hand sanitizer with 60% alcohol where soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surface can be purified in several solutions (in one minute, the stainless steel cleanser), from 6271% ethanol, 50100% propopellol, 0.1% sodium hypochloride, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
other solutions, such as benzaloconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, have decreased their effectiveness.
According to the CDC, COVID infection is suspected or confirmed in a service area, office or children's pool, where a bathroom, shared utility area and shared electrical utility area, table, shared computer, ATM, and other areas need to be cleaned with a disinfectant.
health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with a brace or a cloth and to immediately throw away any cloth.
Surgical field surgery is recommended only for those who are infected. This is because it prevents the virus from spreading over time and limits the spread of the virus when people talk, bite and sneeze.
The world health organization has given guidelines on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Lagos, ""masks/masks can reduce the risk of people touching [the] face, which avoids the main source of infection that can occur with not properly washed hands". Masks/masks can also prevent people who may be infected from spreading the disease to others".
Healthy people should not wear face and nose masks, but only if they are nicki and sloppy with people supporting those infected with COVID-19, they advise the FDA, even though they understand that wearing face and nose masks is good.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by their citizens.
In the United States, CDC recommends that we make masks made of fabric that are not used for medical purposes. China recommends single-use masks for healthy communities, especially when in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
It recommends surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to wear face masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering the public square without wearing a mask or covering their nose and face.
On march 16, vietnam ordered any citizen to wear a face mask to protect themselves and others when leaving home to go to public places.
The Austrian government has forced anyone entering grocery stores to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face and mouth masks when they go outside.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has ordered train passengers and city buses to wear face masks from April 1.
panama requires all those who go out to wear face masks, and encourages those who cannot afford to wear them to do household chores.
face masks are also widely used in Japan, North Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
social distancing or (also known as physical distancing) involves maintaining the spread of the disease and reducing contact between individuals, thus reducing the spread of the disease.
The measures include isolation, travel ban, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
individuals can implement social distancing measures by staying at home, restricting travel, not going to crowded places, saying hello without touching, and keeping themselves physically away from others.
Many governments are currently recommending and making community distancing mandatory in the affected states.
The number of gatherings recommended by the US government body and the Health Organization was reduced from 250 (if there were no known symptoms of COVID-19) to 50 and then to 10.
"On March 22, 2020, Germany imposed a ban on the presence of more than two people outside. The CDC recommended that people with diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, immune deficiency and severe illness and other complications stay away from home as much as possible in the area of the outbreak.
The use of the word social distancing refers to people who are fully engaged in social isolation, rather than encouraging others to continue their interaction through alternative means.
these include advising only those living with you who have no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
For those suspected of being infected and infected with COVID-19, it is recommended to stay home in isolation.
health agencies have issued detailed self-isolation guidelines. many governments recommend that people in the area of the virus stay in isolation.
strict self-isolation guidelines are given to those in high-risk groups.
People who may be at risk of being infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to the country or region where the virus has spread are advised to remain in self-isolation for 14 days from the last day of exposure.
The methods used to control the spread are to block or ban and reduce it.
The movement is being stopped in the early stages of the pandemic, with the aim of identifying and identifying infected people and introducing other new ways of infection control to reduce its spread to the rest of society.
If the spread of the disease cannot be contained further, trials will then be made resilient, steps will be taken to reduce the spread and to cope with the effects on the healthcare system and society.
combined control and resistance measures can be taken together.
Reducing the basic number of newborns to less than 1 requires more drastic measures to change the global epidemic. Part of the control of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the spread of the disease by using a pathology known as the epidemic pathway.
this will give more time to develop vaccines and treatments to prevent overcrowding of healthcare providers.
The measures to control the outbreak include non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand hygiene, mouth and nose coverings and self-isolation; social measures to avoid physical distancing, such as closing schools, cancellation of public gatherings; public participation in the adoption of such restrictions; and strict sanitation measures.
other countries have taken different measures around the world to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced a majority-security screening and isolation, and it issues alerts when infected people are on the move.
Singapore has extended its support to those who have been temporarily detained, and has again punished those who have not.
Taiwan is increasing the integrated distribution of face masks and medical supplies. The survey by Great Britain and the United States shows that there are serious challenges to reducing (but not stopping) and controlling (restoring the spread of the epidemic).
The use of preferred policies reduces the number of deaths by two-thirds and the number of deaths by half. But the number of deaths and the health system in the thousands show that there are many problems.
While the virus is still spreading in humans, it may be preferable to use the strain but it should be kept in place (or until a vaccine is available, if that comes first), so that the spread will respond quickly in the event of a situation.
long-term intervention to combat the virus leads to social and economic crisis.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts have been made, including testing of existing drugs.
taking medicines, drinking liquids, and taking a break can help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on your weight, oxygen therapy, blood transfusions, and respiratory support may be needed.
steroids can lead to worse effects.
Several sites approved for the treatment of viral diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization has also said that some ""traditional and home-made medicines"" may provide relief from the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19".
The WHO said that increasing capacity for COVID-19 patients and improving health care is a key step in the prevention of the spread of the disease.
ECDC and the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move European Regional Office supplies in several sizes, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancelling procedures whenever possible, identifying and isolating COVID-19 positive patients and training staff to increase patient care capacity and increase the number of respiratory machines and beds.
there are many theories about the origin of the first case (sickness zero).
The first confirmed cases of coronavirus were in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
In a month, the number of coronavirus casualties in Hubei has gradually decreased.
Most of these were linked to the Hawai'i seafood wholesale market, which is in addition to the live animal market, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these species, or in other words, zoonotic origin.
"On December 30, 2020, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of the "" SARS-like coronavirus outbreak"".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged with spreading false information, while the other, Ai Fen, was punished by her boss for spreading false information.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued an official announcement on 31 December and notified WHO.
In the first phase of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and five days.
In early and mid-January 2020, as a hub for Chinese New Year migration and post-transit and major rail exchanges, the virus spread to other Chinese states.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new casualties in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data from the United States showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had the symptom. On March 26, the number of confirmed cases in the United States exceeded that in China and Italy. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dead and more than 364,000 people recovering.
about 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have started border controls, blocking free movement.
National measures include keeping things on the ground (not leaving home, setting up a place or closing) and restricting movement. As of April 2, about 300 million or 90% of citizens in the United States were under house arrest, 50 million in the Philippines, 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people were in or out of confinement, up from two to 2.6 billion. This represents a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in the water on 1 December 2019, while an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was detected on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian diagnosed the unknown lung infection category on December 26, 2016, and on December 27, 2018, his hospital notified Wuhan Jianghan CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention).
December 27 2019 Genetic testing of patient samples shows the presence of coronavirus such as SARS.
The announcement was made on 31 December by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.
The World Health Organization was announced on the same day.
At the time of these notices, doctors in the water had received a police warning for spreading al-balata.
China's national health commission said there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, Chinese government launched an active campaign, with Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping calling it a "people's war" to stop the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the largest quarantine in human history, on 23 January, the Cordon Sanitary, or travel in and out of Wuhan, was banned, and the order was implemented in 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
private vehicles are prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) canceled in several places.
The authorities also announced that a temporary hospital from Huashengsan Hospital will be built in 10 days.
an additional hospital, called leshenshun hospital, was built later to treat more patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 special facilities such as public recreation facilities and stadiums in Wuhan into a gzeze hospital. On January 26, the government took further measures to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, including a new passenger announcement and extension of the day for special events.
Universities and schools across the state have been closed.
Many measures have been taken in the regions of hong kong and macao, especially regarding schools and universities.
remote work has been done in many regions of china.
travel restrictions were in place both inside and outside hubei.
museums were temporarily closed due to the change in public transportation throughout china.
"Population controls have been applied in several cities, and some 760 million people (about half of China's total population) have been banned from leaving their homes. After the outbreak reached an international stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "entering" China from other countries".
For example, Beijing has forced foreigners to stay in their designated places for 14 days.On March 23, five days ago, a Chinese man was arrested in a case of a passenger arriving in Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that domestic cases were basically blocked and the spread could be controlled in China.
On that day, restrictions on movement in Hubei were relaxed, which was within two months of the outside restrictions. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry on March 26-12020, while entry visas or residence permits will not be allowed from March 28, it is unclear when this policy will end.
People who want to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
Despite the ongoing disruption to the annual Qingming Festival, the Chinese government has also declared March 26, 2012 as a national day of mourning at 4:00 pm, with a three-minute prayer. The central government has also called on the community to pay due attention and contribute to preventing the recurrence of COVID-19 by implementing physical distancing.
On january 20, 2020, COVID-19 was reported to have spread from china to south korea.
The national health agency reported a significant increase in cases on February 20, with meetings in the new religious movement in Daegu known as Shincheonji Church of Jesus being the main reason for this.
Shincheonji has questioned whether the reinforcement of Wuhan's visit could be the source of the spread.
As of February 22, 2020, about 13% of the 9,336 adherents in the church had 1,261 signs of illness.
on february 28, there were more than 2,000 confirmed cases, rising to 3,150 on january 29.

The February reports (with most of the cases reported so far in China) show racial sentiment that, like various groups around the world, the Chinese people are getting the virus or that this is a legitimate retaliatory move.
anti-chinese sentiment has been evident in some african cities.
he has repeatedly said that he is discriminated against because he believes that Wuhan and Hubei are the source of the virus.
Alert. There is support for Chinese online and offline and in areas affected by the virus.
In a country with the first high prevalence of COVID-19 in Europe, which is a new hotspot, such as Italy, there may be suspicion and increased travel after the incident. Citizens of Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have been working to reduce the spread of the virus, preventing people from entering their country from China.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been featured on Twitter.
There have been reports of racial violence and violence among the Chinese population, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States.
US President Donald Trump has faced a lot of criticism for calling the coronavirus a Chinese virus, and has been described as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked a bus that was taking Ukrainians and other foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
students from northeast india, which shares a border with china, and students in major indian cities have reportedly been bullied in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
"In West Bengal, the state chapter of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dilip Ghosh, the president of China, has corrupted nature and said, ""That's why God is punishing them"."
"The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later declared the comments as "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism have spread among non-Chinese residents because of the epidemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and "to be eliminated".
Many newspapers with paid-only sections have abandoned these sections due to some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the outbreak.
Some scientists have shared results on servers like bioRxiv to speed up the pre-printing.

Laboratory tests use methods to detect respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the presence of a related SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibodies that respond to this infection.
The virus in the samples is tested by RT-PCR and can detect the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is limited and useful for identifying SARS-CoV-2.
to identify the most recent or active contaminants.
serology helps with both diagnostic and public monitoring.
antibody tests show how many people have the disease, including how many people have the symptoms but have little to report or no symptoms.
the exact mortality rate and the immunity of the population can be determined from this test.
Due to limited research work, no country has any definitive data on the extent of distribution among its population as of March 2020.
No country has tested more than 3% of its population until 23 march, and there is a significant difference in testing in each country.
this separation has the potential to have a significant impact on mortality rates, because in some countries it is estimated to be higher than the average.
The test uses the same-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to test samples that are present by rubbing or rubbing the nasal fluid.
results are available in a period of a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing using a fluid sample on the throat is only reliable during the first week of infection.
the virus can then spread from the throat into the saliva.
for those infected in the second week, an alternative sample tool from deep airways can be used with a catheter or saline effect (salt).
One of the first PCR tests was performed in Berlin in January 2020 by Charité. In retrospect of the polymer chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the same time, the World Health Organization (WHO) has conducted 250,000 tests.
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. Kogenebiotech, a South Korean company, developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test tool (PowerChek Coronavirus), which has a clinical status on January 28, 2020.
"It seeks the ""E"" gene found in all coronaviruses, which is to replace RdRp for SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group in China was among the first organizations to receive emergency benefits from the National Health Products Administration of China and is a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 identification tool. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States distributes the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-PCR screening panel for community health laboratories at the same time through international agency sources".
In all three genetic tests, the detection of inaccurate reagents in the older diagnostic tools led to a false result and a crash at the CDC in Atlanta, which successfully carried out an average of 100 samples per day throughout February 2020.
As of 28/2020, the reliability of two-phase tests was not determined and national and local laboratories have not yet received a license to conduct tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use permit. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On 5/2020, LabCorp announced that there is a national RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
Quest Diagnostics had prepared a national COVID-19 test on March 9/2020.
No dose limit is set, and sampling and feeding must be done according to CDC standards.
COVID-19 testing in Russia was developed and produced by the government's Virology and Biotechnology Research Centre, VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had prepared a test for COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA to conduct a large number of tests that would give results within 3.5 hours, enabling 4,128 tests to be performed within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA approved emergency use (EUA) for Abbott Laboratories, which is testing the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA granted similar licenses to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21/2020, Cepheid received the same EUA from the FDA, which takes 45 minutes.
FDA suggests that isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology be used in place of PCR.
This temperature change does not require a period of time, so a positive result in a shorter time of up to five minutes and a negative result in up to 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 machines in the United States, and Abbott is speeding up production to allow 50,000 tests a day. Tests using monoclonal antibodies are directly linked to the novel coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and are expected to show results in 15 to 20 minutes, just like rapid flu tests.
The March 2020 Literature Review concluded that in the early stages, the cost of chest radiographs was too low, but that CT \\[computed tomography] results could be present even before the mark was seen on the site.
Typical features on the CT include binary multi-lobar floor-glass opassiphites with parallel, uninterrupted and backward distribution.
the pressure of under-diversity, the unfairness of the unfairness and the inclusion of all will increase as the disease changes.
The starting point is that the study comparing PCR to CT in water shows that CT has more receptive characteristics than PCR, but with lower limitations, most of its imaging characteristics are similar to that of the process of seizures and diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used as a first-rate COVID-19 screening test. In March 2020, the CDC recommended the use of PCR for first-rate screening.
The immune response is a product of antibodies to the immune system, and includes IgM and IgG.
People who are 7 days or more old when these symptoms begin to appear are tested for infection, immunity, and in public studies. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or at a point of care (PoCT).
automated systems called high-srupt can perform these tests in most clinical laboratories, and the amount of detection will depend on the amount of product in each system.
A blood sample is commonly used for CLT, but serum samples can be used to see the immune response.
for poct blood samples, the most common way is by injection.
An initial action is needed before PCR procedures are introduced. On March 26, 2020, the agency announced that 29 institutions had been named as needed to distribute anti-human tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use permit. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained a European license to detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test is capable of analyzing hundreds of samples per hour and is able to detect viral RNA by PCR from normal ones.
Antibodies usually separate within 14 days of infection. Early in April, no antibody testing equipment was available in the UK.
The NHS in the UK is preparing for home-based investigations of suspected cases, preventing suspected people from infecting others if they go to hospital, and use ambulances to clear infections if they are used. Driving by car takes a COVID-19 test for suspected cases, a health professional sample and the right equipment.
In Germany, according to doctors of the National Co-operative Health Insurance Coalition, on March 2, 10,700 tests were carried out in the previous week, with a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in an ambulance.
health insurance covers expenses when a doctor is appointed for a medical examination.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
by march 19, a motor vehicle inspection was in many major cities.
The total number of tests in Germany on 26 March 2020 is unknown, due to the fact that only positive results are reported.
"A preliminary laboratory study showed that at least 483,295 samples were tested from the calendar week 12/2020 to 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2". Researchers in Israel at the Technion and Rambam Hospital tested a method to test samples from 64 patients at once, and only if a consolidated sample was found to be positive.
With construction under close supervision by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model work could be increased by 47% in Hubei, and the cost of isolation could be doubled if the testing had not been started.
The Wuhan Laboratory was followed by 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As of March 4, 2020, there were 50,000 daily mass tests per day. Open Source Multiplex Design was released by Origami Assays, and it allows for testing of 1122 COVID-19 patient samples using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be done in small labs and robots do not require liquid containers.
In March, a shortage and shortage of diagnostic materials became a major focus in the mass screening process in the European Union, UK and USA.
This led some authors to investigate some testing processes, namely the release of RNA strains by heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes and further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing per capita more than any other country and was on the line to reach the general public.
"This is a car-driving transit, and a whole population is included in the lab from Group 42 and BGI (which is based in the emergency laboratory in "Huo-Yan" China)".
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests a day, and is the first in the world to do so outside of China.
The various test sequences targeted different strains of the coronavirus, and were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has classified the German prescription for equipment as a national product for low-income countries that cannot operate independently.
The German prescription order was issued on January 17, 2020, and the protocol, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control, was not ready until January 28, which delayed testing in the Chinese government, and the United States had problems with the reliability of diagnostic equipment at the start of the pandemic, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate diagnostic tools and advice from health professionals to meet the needs.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive testing capacity in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The south korean government has been building capacity for several years to test in private sector laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization urged that tests should be expedited to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The increased demand for diagnostic tools due to the high prevalence of the virus has led to a shortage of hundreds of thousands of virus diagnostics and a shortage of chemicals.
In March 2020, China announced that there were problems with the accuracy of its testing equipment.
In the United States, the CDC's tests were a problem, and the government removed bureaucracies that restricted private testing. Spain bought the tests from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but the results were not accurate.
the company explained that the wrong results may have been due to a failure to collect samples or to use the equipment correctly.
According to the Spanish Ministry, the devices that produced the wrong results will be replaced by a separate test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic and 80% of the test equipment purchased from China produced the wrong results.
Prime Minister MatoviÄ suggested that these be thrown into the Danube. According to Ateş Kara, a Turkish health ministry official, Turkey has not used the test kits it has purchased from China due to high error rates.
testing, identifying positive people and tracking people with SARS-CoV-2 has led to positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the Italian city of VÃ2, where the first COVID-19 deaths were recorded in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of a total population of 3,400 people in ten days.
half of the positive people had no symptoms and all known events were in isolation.
new infections have been stopped due to restrictions on community travel.
With the search for a high-speed contact line, travel restrictions and isolation, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak spread at a much slower rate in Singapore than in other developed countries, but no more severe measures were taken to force the closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many of the camps were canceled, and singapore began advising residents to stay home until march 28, but schools reopened after the holidays on march 23.
Many other countries have managed to control the outbreak with high levels of touch monitoring, restricted travel, screening, isolation, but with limited national activity, such as Iceland and South Korea.
countries that have more tests than deaths are less likely to get it, according to statistics, because they can easily detect those with no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and limited experience in testing COVID-19 carry out a validation test by sending the first five positive samples of COVID-19 and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 testing centres.
The 16 proposals are based in seven countries in asia, five in europe, two in africa, one in north america, one in south america, and one in australia.
The percentage of people surveyed in the following chart shows that the positive column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
countries that only test people in hospitals have a high percentage of the population tested positive, which means that other factors remain unchanged, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, dirt, or other unnecessary contaminants.
washing hands with soap and water at certain critical times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as flu and cholera, which are transmitted to the mouth without washing hands.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous tissue), they may also get respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold.
The five critical times during the day when washing hands with soap is necessary include: before and after cleaning the toilet, after cleaning the baby's lower room or changing diapers, before feeding the baby and before eating and before cooking or touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Without water and soap, hands can be washed with ashes.
before, during, and after cooking.
before and after caring for a sick person.
after changing diapers or using a toilet to clean the baby.
after your nose is shaved, cut, or torn.
after eating an animal, eating a pet, or touching animal waste.
medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of maintaining hygiene in connection with medical procedures.
washing hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to clean up pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or parasites) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
this is especially important for food preparers or medical professionals, but it is also a useful experience for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of flu-borne infections; and reducing respiratory infections.
and plans to reduce infant mortality in domestic births.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing habits may lead to minor improvements in height for children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and respiratory diseases can be reduced by introducing minor behavioral changes, such as hand washing and soap.
This simple step can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by as much as 50%.
Handwashing interventions can reduce the risk of flooding by up to a third, compared to providing clean water to low-income areas.
48% reduction in flu frequencies can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing is the only effective and easiest way to prevent flu and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in homes, schools and communities around the world.
pneumonia is a major cause of death among children under the age of five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
about 3.5 million children die each year from measles and measles.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap and toilet before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reduce the number of flu-related deaths by half and reduce deaths from severe respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is often combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, environmental and personal hygiene (WASH) programs.
hand washing also protects against contagious skin diseases.
a minor injury to hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition called hand-wetting, which is especially common among healthcare professionals.
hand washing is also one of the symptoms of overexposure disorder (ocd).
There are five critical times a day when soap and washing are needed to reduce the spread of infection: after using the bathroom (urine, urine), after cleaning the baby's lower part (switching), before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or before/after eating raw meat, fish or chicken.
proper hand washing is necessary to prevent the spread of disease, including before and after treating a body or wound that has been cut in some way, after being torn, torn or unturned, after touching animal waste or after touching animals and after touching the waste.
in many countries, it has a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands at home. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest share of 97%. Nearly the middle, the United States was 77%, and China was 23%.
The Education Department of the Philippines's Essential Health Care Program is a model of action to improve children's health and education.
The main objective of this national program is to raise awareness twice a year of the slogan of regularly washing hands with soap and brushing your teeth with fluoride.
in indonesia, it has been successfully implemented.
removing germs from the skin is improved by adding water to soaps or liquid soaps.
The main function of soaps and liquid washers is to reduce solution barriers and increase solubility.
Organic soil constituents of fat and protein are not easily cleared of water, so water alone is not enough to clean the skin.
However, the cleaning is facilitated by a consistent flow of water.
dry soap can be reused and can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A few studies that have examined the transmission of contaminated bacteria with solid soap have concluded that they do not cause much harm because they remove bacteria from the bubble.
The CDC still says liquid soap is preferred for hand-to-hand controls.
Antibacterial soaps have been widely used in a society that promotes healthy habits.
to date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antibiotics or antibiotics selects naturally resistant cells.
However, antibacterial soaps contain a common antibacterial carrier, such as a tricone, which contains a large list of cells.
Thus, although antibiotic resistant forms may not be as effective as thought, unless they are selected with antibacterial soaps.
In addition to skin protection agents, advanced forms such as pH controllers, antimicrobial active benzene acids and additional skin coolants (aloevar, vitamins, menthol, plant derivatives) may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that clear soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps in preventing pain and in eliminating bacteria from the fire.
hot water, which is good for washing hands, is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot and soapy water is more effective at removing natural oils that contain soil and bacteria than cold, soapy water.
contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that hot water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on our hands.
hand hygiene or hand sanitizer is another alternative to non-water-based hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic and water-resistant hand sanitizer options (known as alcohol-resistant handwashes, antiseptic handwashes, or handwashes) became popular.
Most are formed with a thick agent such as carbohydrate (oaklic acid polymer) into a gel, or as a glycerin liquid, or a powder to reduce the effects of alcohol use and alcohol drying.
Addition of hydrogen peroxide in the mixture increases the activity of the antibacterial agent. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol-free hygiene products kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), lung cancer and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
After 30 seconds of hand washing, 70% of alcohol-containing sprays remove 99.97% of bacteria from the hands (3.5 decarbonisation, equivalent to 35 decibels) and 99.99% to 99.999% (decrease in concentration of 4 to 5) 7 eliminate bacteria from the hands in 1 minute. Hand washers are very effective in protecting against bacteria, while they are less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are not fully effective at eliminating viruses (or norweck) that are usually the cause of highly contagious stomach pain. An antiseptic or alcohol-based handwashing should be used to dry or cover both hands well.
All fingers are to be applied for 30 seconds, with the front and back and the ends of all fingers to be applied until the liquid, bubble or gel dries.
The tips of the fingers should be washed thoroughly with both hands closed. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using hand sanitizer, especially when hand washing is obvious.
The increased use of these agents is due to their ease of use and the rapid killing of microorganisms, but they should not be used as a substitute for hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can lead to dry skin if lubricants and/or skin washes are not included in the formula.
The effects of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lubricants to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers have led to significantly less irritation and dryness of the skin with soaps or antibacterial soaps.
allergic contact is less likely to cause allergies due to skin disease, bone disease, or alcohol-free hand washing, or the contents of an alcoholic hand washer.
the tendency to touch irritating skin diseases is more prominent than washing hands with soap and water.
although they are effective, waterless agents do not wash the hands of organic materials, but they can easily destroy them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not suitable for preventing the spread of many pathogens, soap and water can still be used to prevent pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is mainly dependent on ingredients and spices, with a lower level of efficiency: alcohol and alcohol-free wheels.
and recently, it has been shown that the effectiveness of benzene chloride formulations decreases after repeated use, unlike alcohol formulations that decrease after repeated use.
many people in low-income communities can not buy soap and use mud or soil instead.
ash or soil may be more efficient than water, but less efficient than soap.
one concern is that the soil or soil can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce the infection from microorganisms.
like soap, ashes are a disinfectant, producing an alkaline solution in water.
when soap is not available, the world health organization recommends ashes or sand as an alternative.
The proper hand washing method recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease includes the following steps:
touch your hands with warm or cold water.
water is recommended, as pools can be polluted, and the water temperature does not seem to be changing.
often rub your hands with soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands thoroughly when soap is available, not just with water.
search for at least 20 seconds.
massage creates a balance that helps to remove germs from the skin and prolonged massage eliminates many germs.
wash them well with a little bowl of water.
washing in a mud can re-contaminate hands.
dry with a clean towel or let the air dry.
wet and rusty hands are more likely to become contaminated with the re-infection. The most common areas of forgetfulness are the thumb, elbow, middle fingers, and underneath the fingers.
artificial bones and crushed nail color can cause microorganisms.
it is recommended to use a washing lotion to prevent dry hands, which can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
"A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no tap water and/or soap available, such as: draining water from well-suited wells or wells in a sloping area and/or using sewage if necessary in developing countries. In the case of water scarcity (as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving options such as ""TPI-taps"" and other low-cost options".
TPE-TAP is a simple hand-made technology using a wire-woven knob and a small amount of water and a barrel of soap.
While effective hand drying is an important part of hand hygiene, there is some debate about how to dry more effectively in public bathrooms.
The growing number of studies suggests that paper towels are cleaner than electric hand dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted at the University of Westminster in London, and a European Tasis Symposium air dryer, supported by the paper towel industry, compared the hygiene standards of paper towels, hot air hand dryer and the most advanced jet-air.
The total number of bacteria found after washing hands and drying the hot-air dryer increased by an average of 194% on the fingers and 254% on the hands.
Drying in the jet-air dryer has shown an increase in the total number of bacteria on average in the pads of the airbag by 42% and in the pads by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% to 77% on the fingers and on the palms of the hands. Scientists conducted tests to check whether other bathroom users and the bathroom environment could be contaminated by each type of drying.
The air-operated dryer, which was air-conditioned at a rate of 180 m/h (650 km/h/400 mph), was capable of dissolving microorganisms in the hands and equipment and contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
the use of a hot air dryer spreads particulate matter up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper dryers have not shown any spread of microorganisms. In 2005 a study by TÃœV Produkt und Umwelt examined various methods of hand drying.
the following changes in the bacterial count were observed after the hands were dried:
there are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to paper towels.
hand washing is another option when traveling without soap and water.
Handwashing with alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis has long since discovered the effectiveness of hand surgery in the hospital area (1846).
there are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to wash.
one study found a low incidence of infection with regard to their use.
Hand washing is performed for at least 15 seconds, with soap and water or a gel to rub and massage each part of the hands.
hands should be rubbed with fingers.
if there is dirt in the fingertips, a brush can be used to remove it.
germs can remain on your hands in water, so it is important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After it dries, use a paper towel to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
this protects the hands from being contaminated with those features again.
"In the healthcare environment, hand washing is intended to prevent and prevent the transmission of related germs ("bacteria").
According to the new england journal of medicine, hand washing has become unacceptable in most medical settings, causing a large number of doctors and nurses to forget to wash their patients before they rest, thus spreading microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures reduce blood circulation associated with catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper on regular hand washing and hand washing in healthcare settings.
The organization's draft manual on hand hygiene can also be found on its website for public comment.
an important review was done by witby et al.
If a declaration of compliance with the regulatory framework is required, commercial equipment can measure and verify hand hygiene.
"The World Health Organization has "five seasons" of hand washing".
After exposure to blood/fluids from the body
before the pollution-free operation, and
After patient care. Adding antibacterial chemicals to soap (antibacterial soaps) is a handwashing agent.
Such removal may be necessary before surgery or internal settings, where antibiotic resistant agents are widespread. For surgery, you need to 'massage' your hands, a hand opening and closing toilet, dry towels to dry your hands after washing, washing with some chlorhexidine or iodine, and a dry brush to massage, and other bacterially cleaned tools to clean the toe.
all must wear jewelry.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and wrists for about 2 to 6 minutes.
long check-in time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
water on a string should be kept from flowing back into the hands during a rush.
after the hand washing, the hands are dried with clean cloth and put on a surgical vest.
to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or to use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a patient.
In the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is 20% of the initial washing, and that it has very little additional benefit when hand cleaning frequency is increased by more than 35%.
Washing hands with soap and antibacterial soap results in more than three times the rate of foodborne bacterial infections. On average, washing hands with alcohol-containing compounds for about 30 seconds and washing hands with antibacterial soap has been shown to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and claustral diffuse on the hands. Interventions in health care facilities to improve hand hygiene may include education for hand washing workers, increased alcohol-based hand washing, and written and oral notes for employees.
more research is needed to find out which of these interventions is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap and hand washing is seen as a cost-effective, healthy and nutritious tool for promoting good health and well-being.
However, the lack of safe water, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve global handwashing standards.
For example, although there are cheap options for building handwashing facilities, in most rural africa, there are few handwashing facilities near each private or public toilet.
however, less frequent hand washing can be the result of customary practices rather than the lack of soap or water.
Promoting and teaching about handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to lasting behavioural change in the population.
for this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are not. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF 3 star approach, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
if the minimum criteria are met, schools can grow from one to three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations could be part of campaigns to promote handwashing to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
Another example is the global campaign to raise awareness of handwashing. Due to the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF has encouraged the expansion of handwashing emoji.
A few studies look at the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study found that encouraging hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing to human health was first recognized by two pioneers of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician in Vienna, Hungary, and Florence Nightingale, the Englishwoman who founded modern nursing.
many people at that time believed that infections were caused by the odor of miyasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a critical way to prevent the spread of the disease.
The 2009 Swine Flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak have led to increased awareness in many countries of the need for soap washing to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, in germany, posters with accurate handwashing techniques are hung in public toilets and nearby toilets in buildings and airports.
the expression washing hands is a refusal to take responsibility for or cooperate with a matter.
it is a biblical passage in the gospel of matthew in which philatus of penthesia washed his hands after his decision to crucify jesus christ, but it has become a widely used phrase in some english communities.
In shakespeare's mcbaez, lady mcbaez begins to wash her hands with a paint that represents her criminal conscience for the crimes she committed and the crimes that led to her husband's execution.
he also found that after recalling or meditating on immoral practices, people often value handwashing and handwashing more than others.
in addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to participate in other remedial actions such as voluntary cleanup.
Hand washing is a symbolic practice, using hand washing without soap, and is a practice in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, Tewilla and Netila yaday, Judaism, Lavooba in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
hinduism, judaism and islam order washing hands after using a toilet.
and: hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism and islam require washing hands before and after every meal.
workplace risk management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are a means of preventing workplace safety from controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Effective workplace risk management will depend on the workplace and type of work, and will be based on risk assessment of risk sources, the presence of spread in the community and the risk of COVID-19 in the individual.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations are occupations with low interaction with the community and coworkers, and basic prevention measures such as hand washing, keeping employees at home if they are sick, breathing procedures and the usual cleaning and infection prevention are needed.
Medium exposure risk jobs are people who work with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who may be infected by ongoing transmission or international travel.
This includes people from the community, such as schools, high-density areas and high-end retail locations.
For this group, the emergency management team must have a ventilation and personal safety protective equipment using a high-resonance air filter, in connection with basic infection prevention measures, if a person with COVID-19 is exposed.
OSHA considers the risk of serious risks to a known or suspected person who is or is exposed to COVID-19 to be at high risk, and if staff are collecting samples from people known or suspected to be COVID-19 when carrying out aerial production processes, the risk is increased.
The appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering control, such as negative pressure ventilation, and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many effects on the workplace.
workers may be dismissed from work due to illness, caring for others, and fear of exposure.
business practices can change, including what products are needed and how they are purchased (which can be through queues or through a delivery person or a passing service).
Finally, shipping can be disrupted in areas with high COVID-19 exposure. pandemic preparedness and response plan can be used to take preventive measures.
There are many workplaces and work types, including risk-taking, home and community-based threats, and the risk-taking of each worker for their age and serious health problems.
they also explain the necessary controls to avoid such risks and plans for possible outbreaks.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be for national or regional proposals.
The aims of the pandemic response are to reduce spread among workers, prevent people from experiencing high-risk health problems, protect businesses and reduce negative impact on other entities in the supply chain.
the severity of the disease is determined by the location of the business.
The framework for the management of hazard sequences is used in terms of effectiveness in the management of occupational safety and occupational hazards.
In areas where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control methods are engineering controls, which are ultimately supported by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.
engineering controls identify workers from work-related hazards, which are not dependent on the worker's behavior, and can be a cost-effective method to implement.
administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that lead to action by the employee or employer.
Although the effectiveness of personal protective equipment is less than that of engineering and administrative control, it helps to reduce some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected (e.g. filters) and properly applied, according to the employee, in a consistent and appropriate manner, regularly inspected, repaired and replaced, and properly disposed of, cleaned and stored or prevented contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are associated with low-risk communities and other partners.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces are repetitive and deep hand flexibility, advising people to stay home if they are sick, measures such as covering up for breathing related coughs and diarrhea, preparing soft and garbage, being ready to work on the phone and away from shifts, encouraging employees not to use other people's tools and doing a series of workplace cleaning.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step to protect employees, customers and other people in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that people with severe respiratory problems should stay at home for 24 hours until they have a fever, symptoms of inflammation or other symptoms, but should not use any medication that reduces fever or alters other symptoms, and that sick leave policies should be flexible, allowing employees to stay at home, and employees should be aware of these.
According to OSHA, medium-risk activities require close proximity, up to six feet (1.8 m) for people with suspected or no COVID-19, but if they are likely to be caused by the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, or if they have recently travelled to countries with high COVID-19 prevalence.
This includes staff in contact in schools, densely populated areas, and other high-risk retail stores. For this and other high-risk groups, engineering controls include high-impact air filtration, increased breathing capacity, introduction of physical barriers such as plastic explosive devices, and customer service through the window of a car's driveway. Administrative controls and other high-risk groups require that sick workers remain at home, face-to-face meetings in the overhead meeting, a permanent shutdown, a permanent evacuation alert, the introduction of travel restrictions, or the introduction of regular travel restrictions on COVID-19 and other health and safety measures, including the use of medical and occupational safety equipment to protect people from the risks of COVID-19, and the introduction of health and safety measures to prevent COVID-19, the introduction of COVID-19 and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the introduction of COVID-19 and the introduction of health and safety prevention measures, and the introduction of health and safety measures in places of work, and the introduction of health and safety measures to people who are exposed to COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, and the promotion of COVID-19 prevention measures.
how often do employees in this hazard group use breathing?
Proper control to protect a person from sick crew and other passengers on an aircraft includes identifying the sick person at a distance of 6 feet, serving the sick person and providing a front face mask. or asking them to cover their mouths and nostrils with a cloth when they are sick or in a hurry.
flight crew members must wear disposable gloves when handling a sick passenger or when touching fluids or contaminated organs, and in case of a fever, persistent cough, or shortness of breath, use additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items must be placed in a biohydrate bag and contaminated items must be cleaned and contaminated afterwards. For commercial transport, including ships and other passenger ships, the risk controls for dangerous goods include postponing travel and isolating and informing.
The CDC recommends temporary closures and cleaning or disinfection for schools and child care centers, regardless of whether the infected person has entered a school building and the community is dispersed.
In a low to medium-sized community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling travel schedules, dismissing meetings and other events, such as school attendance, stopping large gatherings in guest rooms or cafeterias, extending the distance between seats, separating arrival and departure times, banning non-essential visitors and identifying isolated offices for children who show signs.
With high prevalence in the community, extended school closures can be seen as an option in addition to social distancing. The CDC estimates that the immediate health risks for law enforcement personnel who do their daily work are low.
Law enforcement officials who have to deal with individuals with or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs at a time of distress, workers must disinfect their work belts and equipment with spray or wipes before reusing or using furniture, and use stored work procedures to store and remove used PPE and container and laundry clothes.
OSHA lists some health care and mortuary workers as being at high or very high risk.
High-risk jobs are the areas of healthcare, support, laboratory and exposure to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This is a serious risk if staff are working on aerosol production processes or working with suspected COVID-19 patients.
processes for the production of airborne particulate matter, the insertion of a tube into the respiratory system, the process of initiating a cell, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and tests or immunological sampling assembly.
The most dangerous body work includes the work of people preparing the bodies of people suspected of COVID-19 at the time of their death, meaning that if they perform autopsies, they will be the most vulnerable.
a special negative pressure respirator may be needed for some medical procedures or for the storage of corpses.
The samples must be treated with level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients arriving in the country stay in a restricted containment area based on their suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends that people who are suspected of working at a distance of 6 feet from work and who work with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who work in airborne particulate matter use respirators.
In the US, NIOSH has approved the use of N95 face masks for respiration or should be used in a comprehensive manner, a written respiratory protection program that includes qualification testing, training and health screenings.
Other types of respirators provide great protection and increase comfort. WHO does not fully support covering, and COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends that only staff who perform screening at the entrance doors wear surgical masks.
WHO recommends that people engaged in the care of COVID-19 patients or the transportation of patients without airborne particulate matter use surgical masks, eye masks or face masks and gloves.
If the air conditioning process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
In the face of a global lack of PPE supply, WHO is suggesting a reduction in the demand for PPE by telemedicine, physical restriction, through clean windows, to allow access to people who need direct care, use personal protective equipment for a limited amount of time, care for a large number of people without taking out a breathing apparatus, monitoring the supply chain of personal protective equipment and coordinating people who do not sign.

The case: [Covid-19] easing the strain and preparing for the future
Date and time of delivery: 14/2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensee: CC0: No legal right
this month we found ourselves in a special situation.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has made our human relationships clearer and has also made our responsibility to each other clearer.
While we have no precedent for the challenges, our best response is to global solidarity, cooperation and community building that are central to this initiative.
The friendship and caring that we have seen among our employees through e-mail, phone and chat shows how much we struggle to work with amazing people.
i consider myself lucky to have known you all as a coworker.
last week, someone thanked me for our work.
It's a big sign of how meaningful our world is to be back on Wikipedia and that this critical contribution is online and accessible to everyone.
This will make your job possible, whether you hold the position, whether our colleagues are paid or whether our community is safe.
Our world needs the information that Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
this is the time when not only do we do but also how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
this mission and your role is so important, we may make some major adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
The Bible says that "they will not be able to keep their commandments".
As robyn has previously stated, the c-team met last night to discuss our course and schedule for the coming days and months.
in that talk, we have been thinking about what would be the right answer to what we face and what we should do to keep our organization going during this time.
we wanted to avoid major stress and continue our assignment for a long time.
if you want to call back, it's okay.
For all employees, temporary and temporary workers:
the daily work schedule will be 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until the future is clear.
not that it is a vacation - if you can work more than usual, the assignment may be beneficial.
but it is impossible to imagine where our world is going now, and whether you need to take care of your family, go to the store, or go to the doctor, your safety is our priority.
we do not keep track of your time.
if they do, don't work.
that is not necessary, but we do.
No sick days or PTOs are required - you just have to tell the management staff and check your team's calendars and schedules to make sure they have coverage of key work areas.
(if your COVID-19 test result is positive, please notify Brian to help you and ensure that your case has received proper attention from the administration).
hourly pay.
we have already, and we will continue to give our contractors and clockworkers what we have.
all are paid during normal working hours.
this includes those who are unable to work because of illness.
if you want to work, we will help you.
many people use work to express their anxiety about the world around them.
our work can produce high results, especially in this situation.
again, it's about taking care of yourself.
our question is to talk to your administration about what to expect and to prepare for.
some jobs are considered essential.
there are certain things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR procedures, trusts and security and fundraising teams (among others) perform crucial work that may require additional support.
in all areas, we will begin a process to achieve the current goal and focus on what is essential for our goals.
we all have a lot of work to do, and we all focus on what is most needed.
delay is not bad now.
we do not plan to double the hours of work to finish the delayed work after this pandemic.
nowadays, you are not expected to work overtime to meet unreasonable deadlines.
we accept the changes and work to set new goals and timelines when necessary.
What is created on APP (annual plan)?
to adapt to our new reality and our daily work schedule, we need to adjust the timing of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will allow employees to schedule their work schedules, take care of themselves, and their families, and meet the needs of those who want to work reduced hours.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the current planning stress and pressure on the whole organization.
next week we will notify our staff to the board and let representatives and teams know what the next step is as soon as we have the information.
Thank you for your leadership of this trusted APP team.
The office environment, exposure, and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But, due to the high level of caution, we hired virus detection staff for the San Francisco office.
They have made every floor infection-free using a virus-free mixture of the same type used in hospitals, including the receiver and the elevator banks that reach our floor.
The building uses its own maintenance process using its own products to protect tenants.
we are confident that the office will be fully equipped when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 process with us and our employees in DC.
last week, our dc office followed san francisco's directions to operate entirely from home.
as some of our staff in nyc know, we are also giving a rental speech in brooklyn.
these discussions continue, but may be delayed.
some of our coworkers are working from home for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues know that it can be a fix, and they wanted to give you some tips:
limit the length of meetings to one or two hours.
if longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide smaller sessions into several days.
make the meeting clear, have an agenda, and send out reading materials in advance.
Make video default, which includes tools like Google Docs and Zoom, and facilitates direct collaboration and interaction.
have someone to conduct each meeting, monitor the chats, and monitor the list of speakers, and help you take notes (or take notes in collaboration).
If you need a comfortable earpiece, email technical support.
use your security payments for legal claims.
Join the #remoties site to discuss the work with colleagues
The Human Resources Group is looking for ways to implement the growing work of the foundation by providing a webinar-based ergonomics guide.
Last week, we asked community aid recipients to remove Wikimedia Fund posts that were like editors, until the WHO declared the pandemic over.
we have been informed that our request for cancellation will help them to reach a previously agreed aid agreement and that no one will be punished for delaying or changing these goals.
We will be doing more guidance tracking next week at Wikimania and other regional and limited community conferences.
The characteristic of the international community is not only the sadness but also the relief of the uncertainty caused by the sharp focus on their own community, Wikimedia and others.
Speaking of the future, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki with the aim of managing the pressure on the community and keeping in touch with them.
Keeping up with COVID-19
We will send out invitations to a special staff meeting on Thursday 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
we use this time to share more new information, answer your questions and spend time on our relationship.
we are in this together and we help in any way we can.
At this time, you can access information from this email and other COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
In addition, we are working to maintain a continuous relationship with employees, especially those working in highly affected countries.
If you need help with travel, conditions, a main line of work or coverage challenges, or any other matter, please do not hesitate to inform CRT and work with them.
we are here to provide support and to implement as needed.
If there is a secret wine issue that needs to be handled carefully, email Bryan Judan - Director of Global Human Resources Operations.
none of these changes should be seen as a loss of work.
But this time, it is a recognition that our work and our abilities must be adjusted in a way we have never seen before.
the steps we need to take to support one another are one and the same, to continue working together, to support our activities, and to provide services that support our world.
our planned work will be waiting for us at the right time.
For now, it is time to support each other and create vacancies for the next weeks and months of crucial work.
you are all vital to this being achieved, and we want you all to protect yourself and your families to be better when necessary.
Now - Wash your hands and keep your face clean!
Catherine is part of the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin - conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme found in the outer membrane of cells (cellular membrane) of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is a promising drug target for treating blood vessel diseases, as it reduces angolistin-II levels and increases ang (1-7) against the activity of the related angotensin-change enzyme (ACE). ACE2 serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The enzyme in humans is usually called hACE2.
Angrostin-enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing iron (ironloenzyme) found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is classified as an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transducer domain.
ACE2 is a once-infectious type I membrane, and the enzyme has an active domain, and is found on the surface of the saliva and other internal organs.
ACE2 is extracted from the inner cell by another enzyme called outer cell shades, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually into the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is primarily bound to lymphocyte enzymes of type II alveolar cells, small intestine, vascular and vascular cells, and soft tissue cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, stratum, hypothalamus and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to be a relative balance to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I is a hormone that binds to vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 also cuts off the carboxylic terminal amino acid phenylalanine, which is derived from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe), in the fountain, and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotestin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also kill many other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19, and has been implicated in hartnapp disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 cell spike S1 proteins bind to ACE2 enzyme domain cells and cause the transmission of the virus and enzymes to the endosomes and cells.
This entry process also requires a pre-test of S protein on the host's semiconductor processor TMPRSS2, which may be a currently research-based drug. This has led some to speculate that it may help fight infection by reducing ACE2 levels in the cell.
However, several professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend that regular ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy continue.
A published strategic review and meta-analysis on July 11, 2012, found that ACE inhibitors had a 34% decrease in lung cancer compared to controls.
In addition, the risk of pneumonia was similar in patients treated with high risk of ACE influenza, especially those with brain and heart failure.
ACE inhibitors have also been used in pneumonia-related deaths, with effects lower than overall risk of pneumonia.
Human ACE2 (rhACE2) cell is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lupus, a respiratory disorder caused by liposaccharides that improves the haemodynamics and oxygenation of the salivary glands in piglets.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the 24 hours of active (time duration).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for diseases with classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or with high circulating angiotensin II. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials to treat severe respiratory stress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help track or track the process of identifying people who may have been contacted by the infected person.
in certain government departments and states, many applications have been prepared or submitted with the help of public support.
several frameworks have been developed to develop applications for tracking touch.
privacy concerns have been raised, especially with regard to geographic tracking systems for app users.
Low-interference options include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On april 10, 2020, google and apple announced that they will work together to coordinate the functionality of bluetooth devices to android and ios operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed a phone app to let citizens know if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
TraceTogether app is being used in Singapore.
The app was developed by a local IT community and is available to the government, which was released as open source. In North Macedonia, it launched a Bluetooth-based app called StopKorona! to track exposure and respond quickly to people infected with the virus.
The app is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 april 2020, the app is currently awaiting permission to be placed on google play store and apple app store.
"On 12 April, the UAE government announced that the contact search app is in a very advanced stage. It will also launch within weeks. The same app is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol in Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to prevent them from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, a security engineering professor at Cambridge University, listed a number of problems, including the potential for false positives to be applied to application-based systems and if the application's use is limited to a small segment of the public.
"To address the growing threat of fraudulent or harmful ""coronavirus"" applications, Apple has imposed restrictions on which types of enterprises can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting it to only organizations with a high profile profile or a reputation".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Human rights activists have expressed concern about the impact of extensive surveillance of coronavirus applications, especially as the intelligence infrastructure created to combat the global coronavirus outbreak will be destroyed once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have called for restrictions on such intelligence surveillance.
The organizations have announced eight prerequisites for government projects:
monitoring must be legal, mandatory and affordable;
the lengths of the monitoring and monitoring shall be a periodic period;
the use of the data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes only;
security and concealment of identity of information must be protected and identified on the basis of evidence;
digital control should avoid exacerbating discrimination and neutrality;
any information shared with third parties must be legally defined;
there must be protections to prevent abuse and violations of civil rights;
"A "significant engagement" is needed by "all relevant stakeholders", including public health professionals and a team of experts. The German Keus Computer Club (CCC) and reporters (Reporter Ohne Grenz) (RSF) have also provided a list of inspections without restrictions".
If Google/Apple's plan is not necessary to solve the ongoing tracking problem, it is possible to remove the tracking system from their platforms.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the ability to download and track apps.
network-based monitoring is approved in israel.
Web-based solutions to access dry data have potential problems.
However, not all systems with a central server should have access to private local data, as a number of privacy backup systems have been created that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In south korea, it was used as a non-app-based system to search for contacts.
Instead of using a purpose-built app, the system collects tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card marketing data, and combines text messaging with these infected individuals.
In addition to using this information, the government has made location information accessible to anyone, due to significant changes in data privacy laws due to the MERS pandemic in that country.
This information is open to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany have taken into account the use of central and private protection systems.
As of 6th April 2020, the details have not yet been released.
The idea of respecting privacy and following connections has been around since at least 2013 with a long history of human search. On April 7, 2020, they used a privacy-friendly solution, Bluetooth Low Power (BLE), which showed how close they were to other phones.
However, PPP-PT is a collaborative combination that includes both central and decentralized approaches and a single protocol, with integrated protocols for privacy protection close-distance search (DP-PPT / DP-3T), temporary contact numbers, (TCN, fka contact event numbers, CEN), privacy privacy protocols and for mobile communication search (PACT) and others.
The personal data identified in these protocols will not leave the device, and all relevant data will be applied to the device.
SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy techniques when collecting and using data from the area or roadside to track the spread of COVID-19, is being developed by the privacy team at MIT Media Lab.
"""Apps Gone Rogue: Protecting Individuals' Privacy in Pandemic" is based on a study article released on March 6, 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform, a privacy technology development company at Engma MPC, set up at MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace is a secure hardware technology that allows users to share confidential locations and health information with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that information.
On 5 April 2020, the International TCN Coordination was essentially a similar approach and was divided into mainly protocol-compliant groups, with the creation of a team that would allow for universal connectivity to reduce gaps and monitor applications and alert.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the launch of the BlueTrace protocol, which is used by the official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple Bluetooth, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a communication initiative that they will protect privacy based on a combination of low-power technology and privacy-protected databases.
They also published details of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three stages:

This function is implemented directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple Plan to facilitate integration and to prevent ongoing monitoring problems by distributing the system first after the threat has passed through the system's implementation system updates.
A drug recycling (also known as drug recycling, re-distributing, recycling or therapeutic switching) is a drug that is authorized to recycle a drug other than a previously approved drug.
This is a line of scientific research currently underway to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research areas include COVID-19 vaccination and plasma transfer. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 potential drug proteins, each with a high ligand binding potential.
The investigation of these critical areas involves the provision of a reasonably effective antiviral for COVID-19 proteins.
The most important targets of SARS-CoV-2 are proteins such as papine, RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helix, S protein and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A, et al studied several candidate compounds and later consolidated and analyzed a strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine recommended by the clinical study, compared and analyzed with high-quality approved drugs to accelerate development.
Chlorokine is an anti-malarial drug used to treat certain diseases.
On 18 march, the world health organization classified chloroquine and related hydrochloricine as one of four drugs undergoing collaborative clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the testing process for chlorine and hydrochlorine in New York State will begin on March 24. FDA approved the use of hydrochlorine sulfate and chloroxide phosphate on March 28 under the Emergency Use License (USA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA for clinical trials and is only approved in the EU for use as a trial treatment for patients who cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
According to the CDC, the use, dosage and timing of hydroxychloroquine for proplaxis or the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been determined.
"Doctors said they would use the drug "if there was no other option".
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in conjunction with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at duke university and oxford university.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an evaluation of the use and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medicine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen show that favipiravir is clearly effective.
35 patients in Shenzhen had a negative test result on average in 4 days, compared to 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the duration of the disease.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has told the public that the current evidence for medical support is very limited and preliminary.
On 2 april, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan and use its military to deliver it to university hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe said he would buy the drug and support the Trump administration.
it may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
"A study of the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that ""no benefit was found""".
The drugs were designed to prevent the spread of HIV by attaching them to the prostate.
Research teams at the University of Colorado are trying to develop drugs to create a compound that is related to the SARS-CoV-2 prototype. There is much criticism in the scientific community for disrupting the resources to convert drugs made for HIV/AIDS.
The world health organization tested lopinvir in an international collaboration trial.
Remdesvir has been studied by guild scientists and is an Ebola virus infection. guild scientists have consistently found that remdesvir has potential for anti-virus in vitro, multi-philo-, neumon-, parmexo- and coronaviruses.
One issue of antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more serious disease and spread.

Also, tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a full shot vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
although no vaccine is said to complete clinical trials, there are many trials underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization said it would not be expected to arrive 18 months before the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus-related virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the phase-out safety studies in april.
COVID-19 was detected in december 2019.
A major global outbreak in 2020 will lead to a massive investment and research effort to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using imprinted genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
CEPI report, completed in April, is a report on the monitoring of development initiative, speed, production capacity, balance and global accessibility.
CEPI scientists reported early in April 2020 that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets of the upgrade to Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (grade I developer and vaccine candidate Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (grade I enhancer and vaccine replication: cannabinoid biology, adenovirus type 5 vector)
In April, scientists from the AEA reported that 115 overall vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, 78 were in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 were announced, but public information is estimated to be scarce (in terms of planning or design).
Phase I-II testing is an initial and safe immunological test, usually randomized, spatially controlled and deployed at multiple sites, to determine a more accurate and effective dose.
Phase III trials include additional participants, including control groups, the effectiveness of the drug in preventing the disease, and the negative result due to the moderate dosage.
Of the 79 vaccine trials under development (as confirmed in April 2020), 74 have not been tested on humans (still under preclinical research).

In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their funding to buy supercomputers from IBM, which brought in computing equipment from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
some vaccines have limited effects, also called limited effects.
this means that they are more than just immune.
In Australia, further randomized testing is looking to register 4,170 healthcare workers.
vaccines in development may not be reliable or effective.
Research into the efficacy of vaccines in animal models related to COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and other non-human bedbugs, suggests that there is a need for time to use life-saving viruses of stage 3 and for international cooperation to implement standard safety procedures.
vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or prevention for SARS, which is considered safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs developed to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was believed that the current SARS research could lead to the development of a useful measuring vaccine and a treatment for MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine completed phase-in clinical trials in humans, and three others are in the process of being developed, all with a viral vaccine, two equivalent-based (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have led to a conspiracy theory behind COVID-19 and the idea that a known and already available vaccine is already available.
Articles on various social media sites have also indicated that patents for other types of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus, and vaccines are owned.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
the time between the onset of symptoms and five days can range from two to fourteen days.
although most cases cause mild symptoms, there has been some improvement in viral hepatitis and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered from the disease. The virus is mainly transmitted through human contact, often through breathing, drawing, or speech.
These droplets are produced by inhalation, usually on the ground or on a body, rather than over long distances.
people can also measure by touching the contaminated soil and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours in dry areas.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it can be transmitted before symptoms appear and later stages of the disease spread (rRT-PCR) is a nasopharyngeal rash.
people who suspect the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
recommendations for the use of masks for the general public may vary, some authorities recommend their use, some recommend their use, others recommend their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or separate antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The spread of the disease has been recorded locally in most of the six regions of the World Health Organization.
people infected with the virus may have symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and bleach on the face or lips.
Most often, symptoms of upper respiratory tract appear as a burst, a sore nose or throat.
symptoms of digestive problems such as diarrhea, nausea, and diarrhea have been reported in varying percentages.
In china, some cases were initially only reported as breast and organ defects.
in some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
this is the period of time the symptoms are present.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms show symptoms within 11.5 days of the date of infection.
The role of these non-symptomatic carriers in the spread is not yet fully understood, however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The number of cases without symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with 20 percent of confirmed cases remaining unknown during their hospital stay, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
The National Health Commission of China included first cases on 1 April, including individual cases. 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that day were identical during the test.
Both acta and spinach can carry a wide range of viral loadings.
loud talk is more likely to cause drops than normal speech.
According to a study in singapore, uncovered cough causes droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) long.
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has confirmed that bioaerosol transmission is possible and that airborne collectors are testing positive for viral RNA in the outer airway.
Some medical procedures, such as macular and cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory tract to enter the air and spread through the air.
Although there are risks of transmission through the urethra, the risk is considered low. The virus is highly contagious when people show symptoms.
While the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is not entirely clear on how easily the disease spreads, one person infects two to three others in total.
The virus was found in the cardboard, in particular, in plastic (polypyllinine) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to 99% copper for about four hours.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. Soap products dilute, destroy, and freeze the viral fat-resistant coating from skin and other substances.
Other solutions such as benzodiazepine chloride and chlohydride gluconate (anodizing) are not effective. Medium-grade samples were taken in a Hong Kong study two days after the start of hospital treatment.
The first sample of five of the six patients showed the highest viral load, while the sixth showed the highest viral load on the second day of the test.
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus, first identified in three people in water with severe respiratory syndrome, and later associated with pneumonia.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur naturally in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks down the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable to COVID-19, because the virus acquires host cells through the enzyme angostine enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most common alveolar cell in the lungs.
The virus uses a special layer of "stimulant" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
A heart attack is a common condition in 12 percent of patients hospitalized in Wuhan, China.
During the course of the disease, cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system problems, but severe myocardial damage is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
In patients with COVID-19 infections, high blood pressure (31%) and hormone retention (25%) were found and may be associated with post-prostate.
Although SARS-COV-2 is associated with respiratory cells that reveal ACE2 to express respiratory function, patients with severe COVID-19 have systematic blood pressure symptoms.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secret T-cells have been shown to be associated with the enzyme-in-6 secret blast monotone and severe pulmonary pathology induction in COVID-19 patients.
lymphocytic infections have also been reported in autopsies.
The health organization has published several global test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the snapshot-precision polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed on breathing samples held with a nasopharyngeal swab. However, a sample of nasal swelling or acne can also be used.
results are available in a few hours to two days.
blood tests can be used, but these require two weeks of separation and two blood samples, and the results are not very valuable.
Chinese scientists have identified and published a genome sequence of coronavirus disease to allow laboratories around the world to develop separate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to investigate infections with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, anti-virus tests (which can identify active infections and if someone has previously been infected) were in progress, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience in testing shows that only 60 to 70% of the data is accurate.
FDA in the US approved the initial care-testing test on March 21, 2020, at the end of the month. Test guidelines issued at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University indicated methods to identify infections based on clinical characteristics and influenza risk.
Double multi-storey floor-glass openings with a backward, originating and backward spread are common prior to infection.
Sub-extensive dominance, manic inflammation (with variable alveolar filling for lobular septal thickness), and strengthening may be seen as the disease progresses.
There is little information about the process of changes in the small lesions and the COVID-19 disease.
The results of major pathology tests on the body:
Macropsy-pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia
There are four types of viral hepatitis:
Soft lymphoma: pneumonia, pulmonary hyperplasia, splenic disease, lymphoma, and the formation of a large central cell
severe pneumonia: alveolar damage (DAD) is spread by alveolar oxidase.
DAD is a cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hyposemia.
Healing of the lung: exposes in the central fibrous between the alveolar cavities and the lungs
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic response
To reduce the risk of infection, precautions include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, monitoring the hygiene of the respiratory system and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or nose with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a cloth and using the inside of the neck if there is no cloth.
after any cough or diarrhea, it is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face masks in public gatherings to limit the spread of the disease if the person is a carrier. Social distancing strategies are a strategy to reduce contacts among infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
distance guidelines include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
"There is no known effective vaccine against COVID-19 and as the vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is attempting to reduce the outbreak known as ""delaying the spread of the virus"".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are clearly dirty, before touching the nose and flushing, or before and after eating.
Only when soap and water are not readily available, it is recommended to use alcohol-based handwashing with at least 60% alcohol content. In areas where hand sanitizers are not available on the market, WHO has provided two formulas for environmental products.
in these formulations, the activity of the antibacterial agent is derived from ethanol or isosopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used in alcohol to remove bacterial tumors, it is not an active ingredient in hand-antiepsis.
glycerol is added as a humectant.
people will implement financial assistance, which may include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organs and support for injured people.
CDC recommends that people who believe they are infected wear a light face mask.
Artificial oxygenation of the endocrine membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems, but benefits are still being seen.
personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. the world health organization and the national health commission of china have issued recommendations to care for people hospitalized in COVID-19.
Doctors and respirators in the United States have complied with medical recommendations from various agencies to use the free source of information IBCC.
As of april 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For testing, some medical professionals recommend papamol (acumannonone) for first-line use with respect to ibuprofen.
precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of viruses when performing airborne processes such as inhalation or hand breathing.
In addition to taking regular precautions, precautions and air precautions, CDC recommends that the person be admitted to the Air Infection Refugee Unit (IIR). CDC lists guidelines for personal protective equipment.
Recommended gear: PPE clothing, respirator or facial features, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, respirators are preferred (rather than face masks).
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but FDA has approved them as masks for use under the Emergency Use License (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness on a specific biological agent does not guarantee a service outside the product description.
When there are no masks, the CDC recommends wearing face masks or using homemade masks as a last resort.
Most COVID-19 injuries are not as severe as mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but minor injuries are severe.
The respiratory type of individuals with respiratory problems related to COVID-19 is being actively studied for people in the hospital, with the pain being eliminated with high nasal flow or two-stage positive airway pressure.
it is not known whether either of these benefits the patient with the same chronic illness.
Some doctors prefer a mechanical ventilator when available because air conditioning limits the spread of particles compared to a higher nasal decomposition.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which is a result of the sudden increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization, which limits the ability of the health system to control.
A study in China found that 5% went to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 will be admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen becomes more difficult.
Air intakes that increase air pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygen supply while reducing the risk of respiratory damage and pneumonia associated with breathing.
high PEEP may not be found on long-lasting air fans.
A study on feasible treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems very promising.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other services or are already undergoing high-level testing.
antiviral drugs can be tested on people with serious illnesses.
The World Health Organization has proposed that they volunteer and participate in efficacy and safety trials of potentially effective medical methods. FDA has granted a temporary FDA test permit when an individual's life is in serious danger or immediately at risk.
he did not review the clinical studies needed to prove that the disease is safe and effective.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the pandemic.
users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can use intelligence to get 'close contact', thus determining the risk of exposure to the disease.
each user can also check the status of three other users.
If an accident is detected, the app not only alerts local health authorities to isolation, but also to isolation. Facial data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and them.
In March 2020, Israeli government security agencies were able to track mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus cases.
measures have been taken to identify and protect those who may have contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared enhanced phone area data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented face recognition technology to identify those who are not being isolated.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that 40 percent of people continue to move around in any way, mobile phone operators said.
The German government conducted a 48-hour study with more than 42,000 participants on weekends.
President of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid also called on the international community to create innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
individuals may be at risk of isolation, travel restrictions, medical complications, or infection.
Rory O'Connor quoted BBC as saying: "Social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic decline are the perfect wave of people's mental health and well-being".
other common respiratory diseases, such as common cold, may progress mildly with few or no symptoms.
mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but severe or severe illnesses can take three to six weeks to recover.
Depending on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be more likely to get severe infections for COVID-19, but there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause mumps by attacking the mumps.
In the most affected people, COVID-19 can lead to rapid respiratory problems, death threats or multiple organ failure, leading to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
COVID-19-related problems include sepsis, unhealthy stomach ulcers and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Unhealthy urination, especially increased prostate time, was seen in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 and in 4% of this group, in abnormal kidney function.
About 20 to 30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the initial symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in hospital beds.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a seven-day average between hospitalization and death.
In earlier cases, the study showed early signs from mid-life to death, ranging from six to 41 days, with 14 days.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men increased by 2.8% and for women by 1.7%.
A historical study of postmortem lung samples reveals cell-cell fibroxide in both lungs and alveolar damage.
viral cytopathic changes have been observed in neocytes.
The lung image is similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In China, 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, heart disease is a major coronary artery disease.
According to data from March, 89 percent of those hospitalized in the United States had a pre-existing condition.
deaths vary by state because of these regional differences, but may be due to political problems.
small cases can cause a very high death toll.
however, death is a consequence of past events, so the current mortality rate is estimated to be lower.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are 2.4 times more likely to require or require more care than smokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities confirmed a 20% to 30% reduction in samba levels in some recovering patients, and the severity of their body damage was determined by scans.
This can cause symptoms after post-exercise recovery.
As of march 2020, it is not known whether the previous infection will provide an effective and long-term resistance for those who recover from the disease.
The incidence of the disease is seen in other coronavirus traits, but later positive tests for the coronavirus were reported after recovery from COVID-19.
these cases are thought to be worsening rather than being treated again.
The virus is believed to be of natural and animal origin through natural and aggravated infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection will be fully transmitted from person to person.
The first 41 confirmed studies of COVID-19 published by Lanet in January 2020 indicate that the date of onset of symptoms is December 1, 2019.
The world health organization reported the first signs of illness since 8 december 2019.
various measures were taken to measure the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and affect social characteristics such as the size of the trial, the quality of the healthcare system, medical options, the onset of the pandemic and age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, the emergency deaths for laboratory-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 were given the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 and U07.2 in a COVID-19 test study of a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease in clinical or related diseases.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the U.S. has accounted for 6.9% of deaths globally since April 17, 2020 (153,822/ 2,240,191).
Other measures include the CFR (Case Mortality Rate) and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which reflect the percentage of people who die from the disease (treated and untreated) who die from the disease.
and these statistics are not limited to a specific time limit until certain people are given a vaccine.
although all infected individuals may develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people are infected.
In the small village of Castiglione d'Adda, home to 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) people died in the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through carnival events, and spread to young people, causing relatively little death, so all COVID-19 deaths may not normally be classified as such.
Furthermore, the German healthcare system is not overpowering.
blood donors estimate that 3% of the population in the netherlands may have antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) have confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rate of the pandemic are different for men and women.
In studies in china and italy, the death toll is higher.
The greatest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only close to 90.
In china, the mortality rate for males was 2.8 percent and females 1.7 percent.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but racial and behavioral issues may be one reason.
for sex-related diseases, smoking can cause higher mortality rates among women than among men, such as low blood pressure.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 are men.
As of april 2020, the us government is not tracking sexual-related data related to COVID-19 infections.
studies show that men and women, such as ebola, hiv, influenza and SARS, have different symptoms.
a large number of healthcare workers, especially women nurses, are also more likely to be exposed to the virus.
World health organization on february 11, 2020 the main name of the disease will be covid-19.
According to the World Health Organization Director-General, Theodoros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, carbon corona, the virus was first identified for the virus, the disease and the outbreak of 19 people, on December 31, 2019.
In order to prevent discrimination, the name was chosen to avoid confusion with a specific geographic area (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international recommendations. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The world health organization also uses the terms covid-19 virus and covid-19 virus in public communications.
"The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the 'coronavirus.'"
The virus and disease were first identified in Wuhan, China, where they were commonly known as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended that the 2020 nCov and 2019-nCoV Emergency Respiratory Diseases be used as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines for the use of locations in the virus and virus names.
The names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were named on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in regular supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nasal sprays and air conditioning units.
For example, an Italian hospital needed an emergency ventilation valve and the supplier could deliver it in the required amount of time, while a local startup fire-nurse printed 100 valves a day for a night.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the origins, balance, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and information have spread rapidly on the internet.
humans seem to have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
there is no cure or vaccine.
Global research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a Solidarity Test to evaluate the treatment effects of four existing antiviral chemicals that promise to be highly effective.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have both been used by SARS-CoV before, as they use ACE2 receptor receptors to enter cells.
There are three vaccination methods under investigation.
first, researchers aim to develop a general viral vaccine.
The use of this type of virus, active or dead, is to respond to the human body's immune system against serious illness, to a new exposure to COVID-19.
The second strategy is sub-vaccination, with the aim of developing a vaccine that monitors the immune system of certain sub-components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on an S-spike protein that helps the virus to handle the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines) - a new method of producing vaccines.
Test vaccines for safety and efficacy must be tested in these methods. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was launched in Seattle on four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that exposes the disease. Although it has been proposed as a risky anti-human enhancement for preparing for SARS-COV-2, this is controversial.
As of april 2020, more than 300 clinical trials in operation are underway.
they were reviewing previously approved treatments for malaria, including four approved studies of seven hydrochlorokines or chloroquines.
Most recycled antiviral drugs carry out Chinese research, reported in late April in nine Chapter III trials on multiple countries.
A dynamic review of clinical progress for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was conducted as of April 2020. Reflovir, chloroquine and hydrochlororoquine, Lopeavia / Rutanavir and Lopenavir / Rudanavir in combination with interferon beta, are evaluating the treatment of many existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 .
there is concrete evidence of the effectiveness of the price reduction by march 2020.
clinical improvements were seen in patients treated with compassionate-use therapy.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020.
However, calls have been made for peer review.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chlorokin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking one gram a day, but twice the dose can be more dangerous and deadly.
On March 28/2020, the Selection of Doctors for People with COVID-19 issued an emergency use license for hydrochloroquine and chloroxine. The Chinese 7th edition of guidelines also includes the use of interviron, ribavarin or umfenoviron against COVID-19.
Early data suggest that high levels of ribavarin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After showing a low pressure stock for SARS-CoV-2, it was recommended that Nitazoxanide be used as an additive in vivo studies. Studies have shown that high protein consumption of trans tissue prototype serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry into SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydrochloricurine with or without arthromycin have major limitations on how the medical community can prevent these treatments from being treated without further study. Oseltamivir does not pass on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cyclone cytokine may be more complex in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytoquin wave properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines of the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
A national level stage 2 trial is underway in Italy after showing positive results in people with serious illnesses.
It is intended to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in the victims, in combination with blood tests by Sam Fritzstein to identify the toxic wave.
The interleukin-6 receptor receptor was approved by the FDA based on studies based on the response to treatment of steroidal reverse ectoxin release syndrome, published in 2017 in CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no random, controlled data that suggests that tocylizam is an effective treatment for CRS.
The vaccine is being tested as a recommended method for people who need filtered and stored antibodies created by people recovering from COVID-19.
This strategy has yielded unconvincing results for the SARS experience.
Viral neutrality/control is a thought-provoking measure that can make an immune medium against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques such as anti-addictive cellular cytotoxic and / or fungitocytosis are possible.
Other types of indirect antigen therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are rare.
the recovery of the blood fluid from patients recovered may be increased to speed up the production of the disease-causing stem cells, which contain antibodies specific to the virus.
