Inflation in Europe has been a disaster for food
The accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, prices in the 13 euro area countries rose more than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts said only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the key interest rate, saying that lower interest rates, with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
One analyst says it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we have to deter" inflation so that it does not have to intervene in the future.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has picked up because of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The market shares of cereal futures rose by 88 percent and the price of soybeans also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of edible oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price has risen 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold was worth almost $100.
According to the ECB, the inflation rate will fall from 2.1% this year to 2.5% in 2008, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup reports a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of Fidesz (Young Democrats Alliance) supporters increased significantly in early December, so that it now has the highest number of supporters since 2002, while Gallup (Poll Institute) has never before found such low socialist support, at 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of MPs: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the loyal voters who were sure to go to the polls, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the previous low, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation of the country to be particularly serious was never higher, rising to 41%, and according to a further 46% the situation was rather serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects the situation to worsen and only one tenth expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, thought the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent the Fidesz president.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of the population who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office after the riots in October last year, only 20 percent now believe that holding new elections would be the solution.
When asked about their intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents say they would certainly vote and an additional 20 percent say they would probably vote.
By comparison, for a "parliamentary election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and an additional 15 percent would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees for higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital costs.
When we look only at the same proportions of people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has raised its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs shopping triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent from last year, although the VAT rate did not increase this year.
The article by Napi Gazdaság (Economy of the Day)
This year, in the Budaörs shopping triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with a value increase of well over a thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had already skyrocketed in supermarkets in December last year, have not risen sharply from their previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below 9,000 forints last year now cost more than 10,000 forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 HUF, at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573.
(In 2003, this was HUF 6,800.)
Prices for unicum and live fish have remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey fillets, walnuts and poppies have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Statistical Institute), but at Auchan, one kilo of bread was found at only HUF 139.
Competition did not bring the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was surprising to see that in this hypermarket too the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was under 200 forints, so that the bottle cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora raised the price of her daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan raised them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
When we compare the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a gap of 12 percent while the difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive basket of this year is 21 percent.
Prices have risen by an average of HUF 1,480 a year.
Last year prices rose by an average of HUF 1 206 although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already being felt in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has left trade confused, hypermarkets cannot clearly determine which margin to apply to products as they are unable to foresee the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
The change in the VAT rate led to such an excessive increase in the prices of the Daily Basket that the most expensive basket was HUF 1 720 higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only HUF 844.
This year the difference was not so great, as the most expensive basket was worth HUF 1 630 more than last year and the cheapest basket also increased by HUF 1 284.
As we approach the two Christmas seasons, we see a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods have risen by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Institute has recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the newspaper, this seems almost absurd, since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent from the base.
The indices show that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the price surge accepted by the multinationals as well.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets don't complain, they're consistently having good years.
In our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets they visited.
They buy everything in bulk, they take the long-term food on pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the cash registers of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the provinces, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for durable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
Hygiene in hospitals, insufficient beds, and overwork of medical personnel are not helping to prevent infections, says the chief physician of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
Earlier this year, a similar infection occurred at the same location.
The man who was seriously injured in a car accident was released from the hospital but soon afterwards had to return to the hospital because of an MRSA infection and since then doctors have been unable to perform a major operation on him because of the bacteria in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Hospital Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
That is, the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop a highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that will multiply quickly in poor hospital conditions.
If the immune system is temporarily or prolonged, the bacteria can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, underweight or debilitated patients.
According to the chief medical officer of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of daily life in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, because MRSA is not found only there or not looked for, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The ASs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff are wearing rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, patients in hospital are screened for MRSA, but infection cannot always be prevented.
The sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is most common in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients in hospital and isolate MRSA patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
Please note that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these examinations.
Most cases are only detected if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief medical officer of the Epidemiology Center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to target antibiotic therapy, in other words microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is spread from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
The Commission has also been consulted on the draft directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
MRSA is spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact, but due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close together, while in terms of epidemics, patients should be kept at a distance of at least 1.5 meters from each other.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals in difficult financial situations are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Karolina Böröcz said.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA is a huge expense for the social security funds, which is why the fight against this infection is everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections are showing a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The police commissioner, who was involved in a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official report on the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It is not possible that the 22nd arrondissement's commissioner, who has resigned since then, who ran over a pedestrian and killed him last Tuesday, was driving drunk or dizzy, Attila Morvai, spokesman for the capital's public prosecutor's office, said on Friday after the findings were made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which had already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
On Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd arrondissement police station ran over a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned in his car on Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd arrondissement.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance.
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following the accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police communication, the accident had upset him greatly.
The investigation into this case is being conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total of €400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, for which a EUR 100 million credit agreement has already been signed by the parties.
The agreement on the EUR 150 million loan also concerns budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, the remaining EUR 150 million of which will be available later, following the extension of the loan agreement.
The parties signed a €50 million innovation contract, which will be used by the state budget primarily for the research and development project at the University of Debrecen.
The negotiations also covered the project for metro line 4.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the original contract once Hungary had finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB provides loans at the Euribor rate, with an eight-year grace period and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, the EU's housing market paradise
The Bulgarian real estate market is evolving dramatically, and the attention of all Europe is now focused on this Balkan country, which has been little mentioned in the past.
What, or who, bought on this EU market which is still the cheapest but which will soon become expensive?
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the measure is compatible with the internal market.
Currently, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the hottest target in Eastern Europe for real estate with its cheap ski flats and seaside homes.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nessebar but there are more and more people looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also attract the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the cheap corner of Ruse.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office space promising the highest rate of depreciation.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe and thus a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. e Black Sea and the most famous ski resorts are traditionally full of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional manager of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to move in buy renovated buildings, which cost between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, which cost between 5 and 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and generally the local doctor.
The second group includes second home buyers (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realising medium to long-term value.
The price of housing in the capital is constantly rising because of the increasing demand.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but over the past five years they have risen by 21 per cent a year.
The increase in house prices essentially outstrips the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to the communication by Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, but on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to set out efforts to be made beyond the Kyoto Protocol's emissions reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there is a lively discussion on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that it was not willing to discuss exact figures at this time, but was willing to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund set up by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, likely to be part of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, confirmed the EU's ambition to remain a flagship in the overall efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of whether the 'Post-2012 Agreement' was successfully signed, and was prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also willing to make commitments commensurate with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the countries signatory to the Kyoto Protocol had set a total reduction target of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at the time had committed to 8 per cent less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared with the 1985-87 period, and Hungary will fulfil its commitment, the Environment Ministry press release says.
The stakes are high in Bali because the international long-term climate agreement must be in place within two years, otherwise the agreement will certainly be postponed beyond 2012, in which case the reduction commitments below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be immediately followed by a new international emissions reduction system, the need for which was highlighted in the new report of the IPCC, the international scientific body that won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius would be unavoidable, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British Army units share video-sharing site footage of their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in an attempt to gain popularity.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) became a fan of YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan uploaded video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are monitored at the Air Force operations headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is essential
The Air Force soldiers have already put 139 videos online through this channel and their "channel" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The UK Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and it shares videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (IPF) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original goal, the videos were posted online for recruitment, and the Defense Ministry said they were also used to inform the general public about the real objectives of the military presence abroad.
Although propaganda by this means is relatively inexpensive compared with the usual recruitment advertisements on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defense consultant, told the BBC, it also inevitably carries a political message, since it justifies in a special way the justification for military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is annoyed because, in addition to the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been posted on the sharing site that also show, for example, the death of soldiers: in the official propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never show the bloody side of the battle.
In fact, many videos had already been posted online showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out in real-life operations, but the British Army only recently got excited about uploading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently using the free-to-download shooting game America's Army, in which the player can put himself directly in the soldiers' shoes in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in the ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Labour Minister, does not seem sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with donuts and coffee.
Another department will throw a party with live music, yet another will charm officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, this is how power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence but it will not be the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for Missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The Ministry is planning a budget of HUF 25 million to create the atmosphere for the end of the year.
Compared with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be celebrating.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of HUF 4 320 000 and, of the 600 employees in general, 350 are expected.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas party cost HUF 4 700 000 and was held on Wednesday at the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and a dinner.
The hall cost one million forints to rent, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have received information that a NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas party which is being organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the tendering company.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person in charge.
Suit is not compulsory
The ILO building was not only the home of the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of a Christmas party held a ball on the occasion of St. Luke's Day on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
There were five hundred people at the ball.
The party began with the minister's welcoming words and the dinner was followed by a dance party to live music.
Answer to [original question]: evening dress was not at all compulsory at this ball.
The health, labour and local authorities are preparing a sober celebration.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a work-end meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and donuts, the press service said, and the party will cost only 350 000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister for Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall where 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest, including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
There is no party atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's speech but also by the time of the party in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle in the City Wood and according to the ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints per person is calculated for 100 guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The annual cocktail party begins with a few words of welcome from the minister and is followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee on Friday to coordinate the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health care bill, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as railway traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV (public transport company) employees will also strike until 1 pm.
The unions will announce Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers Councils.
The strike committee of LIGA-MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as coordinator of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the health insurance law, is not fixed.
If the National Assembly does not pass the law on health insurance, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, the vote on the health insurance bill is likely to take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the planned strike on Monday, there will be significant traffic jams: railways will stop working indefinitely and in the morning some public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being shut down.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for strike action, and the list of these is updated regularly on the League's website.
Some organizations have announced an indefinite strike, others have announced a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to reach an agreement on minimum services, and as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1 pm, Budapest Airport between 7 am and 9 am, the Electricity and Heat Energy Industrial Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for strikes for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike nationwide alternately, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) affiliated to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second demand is that the new method of calculating pensions to be introduced from next year be introduced in stages.
The third demand is a guarantee of early retirement, which would allow the rightful positions to be filled before 2010.
The fourth ground of appeal is the rejection by the Free Railway Workers' Union (VDSZSZ), affiliated to the League of Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed in August last year with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
In its  risk warning , the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the biggest political risk is already that  aggressive ethnic clashes may occur in the short term as a result of the worsening of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary .
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy, which is likely to cause this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors:  public actors have passed on the public debate on the Roma issue to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians .
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely to occur, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media  has significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, particularly regarding confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity .
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since autumn 2006, numerous associations have been established in Hungary since summer 2007 under the name of  National Association of Self-Defense .
 The common feature of these meetings is that they define themselves as a civil organisation while they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, and also by referring to the inadequacy of the police, the army, in other words the state , they added.
They pointed out that everything was done according to the method which, based on the rancor of society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civilian aspect.
The emphasis on civil status and association status therefore serves not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering associations in court but also constitutes a political strategy.
The analysis shows that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor which also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
 In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region, they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma riots that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to form a guard saying that the organization's goal is  national self-defense .
They say that for the past 17 years, the Gypsies have  terrorized  Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, says Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked a lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
They say that the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations about setting up their own guards as a resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The similarities between the Hungarian Guard and the Bulgarian National Guard do not exclude the possibility that Hungarian Roma may react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, the risk warning from Political Capital says.
When asked for information by the Telegraph Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party's not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law defines the exact days of public holidays, and around the holidays it has become common to reorganize the working days, which will be reduced next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Holidays are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter especially so that the wakers can rest in peace.
In addition, we have a total of 11 red-marked holidays in a year.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 which is also the commemoration day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
Besides, we have two days in Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, state or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, depending on the calendar, it has become common to rearrange working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years the Minister of Labour has laid down special regulations on the days of substitution for the days before and after the holidays.
The law applies to all employers and all employees employed by them, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions which operate continuously and are in service by virtue of their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24 onwards, life stops almost all over the country because experiments show that most people work overtime or take vacations they have saved for this purpose so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be rearranged for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay home four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day, so you will have a day off on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
But next year, the end of the year is coming with the holidays because from December 24 onwards, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six trivial things that can be a huge annoyance to coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never get, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that  beautify  a workplace's daily life.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or whether we rise to the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations that cause trouble for others.
Examples.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you got a call from the marketing department.
That you missed a date?
At best, he's sorry and tries to make things right by calling the marketing department and telling them he forgot to pass the message (the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before giving hurtful explanations, it is helpful to think about how you can cause unpleasant situations for your workmates and to work to avoid them.
You're borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to grab a file or a desk tool or a phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it was gone the next morning?
You wouldn't happen to find your pen you thought you lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your coworkers without asking, or they're right to be angry at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring envelopes home, just mail them in your pocket because it can be annoying when they're gone and you need them right away.
You're talking about the private lives of your colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what, with who?
Or why?
Do not tell everyone your information (assumptions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a coworker confides in you, do not abuse his trust.
Keep the shared information to yourself and don't discuss it with your coworkers in his absence even if your coworkers know about it.
You're calling yourself sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you call in sick on the pretext of a debilitating headache because you feel sick or you feel you need to rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your deadline assignments need to be done by someone else for you.
Don't bother your coworkers!
If you know in advance that you will not be at work the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, be sure to tell your boss and coworkers so that they do not be surprised when you are not at work the next day.
The whining, the laughing, the phone
You're so busy with your work, but the laughter of your colleagues suddenly pulls you away?
Have you unwittingly become a witness to a phone conversation that you should have ignored?
Don't disturb your coworkers with humming, singing, talking out loud (over their heads), kicking, swearing, or loudly expressing complaints.
They can be annoying even if your colleagues are not involved in a project - writing, designing, organizing.
You blame others for a mistake?
If you're late with your work, forget to send an important e-mail or text, don't blame anyone for that.
Don't blame him for the mess in the office or the noisy coworkers!
If you have committed a mistake and caused others to suffer, admit it and correct the mistake.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake, correct your negligence.
Do you feel too comfortable in the office?
Wearing jogging boots and slippers is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Don't wear comfortable jogging shoes even if your job allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your coworkers and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it by wearing nice, fancy clothes to go to work.
If you want to live up to expectations, you're no longer interesting
We're moving slowly through the usual morning traffic jam.
Suddenly, a peculiar melody is heard on the radio - the voice of a violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn it up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes in to accompany the notes of the whole time, then a female choir comes in and joins in like a real gem.
Mr2 is playing Zagar's Wings of Love.
Hungarian musical life did not spoil us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now, it sounds like the cork gets different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are slowly beginning to change the overall image and, despite the new trend of guitar-shattering garage rock, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he himself played in the Yonderboi band before he started on his own path, perhaps because there is no room for two feet in one shoe.
His project (Zagar) and his music, a blend of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, were only beginning to gain recognition when he was commissioned to compose the soundtracks for the films (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The band, which started out playing in small clubs, started to become known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine listed their 2002 debut album among the top fifty records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the only Hungarian trendsetters who would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have become undeniably  trendy  but no one asked them if they wanted to wear that label.
The band did the right thing, they put out a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line from Balázs Zságer's old group of Pecs.
We are well on our way with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the louder guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the album premiere at Millennium Park.
On the album, a real radio hit, mr2 Petõfi, recently playing popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is all right ?
hvg.hu has asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new hit makes me ask a question: has your music really remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn't mean much to me.
For me, there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made just to sell and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is one or the other more open to your music?
ZsB: Overseas, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people in their 10s and 20s but also the older ones.
They are much more attentive to the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people, are listening to your music?
ZsB: I'm obviously happy to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts where the mutual influence is already working but is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you try to live up to the expectations of the public, you're not going to be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and has made a career out west.
ZsB: We don't really follow his path, although sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
We're more like team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because many of us left his band and went our separate ways.
hvg.hu: On the mr2 Petõfi list, Wings of Love is number one.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you've consciously opened up to a wider layer?
ZsB: We didn't plan on making a hit record to sell the record.
This song means more than that.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try and soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes that are covered throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did they - what was the guideline?
ZSB: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was made up of six members, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who later became known as the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little?
ZsB: This song had already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing from this song.
The chord sequence drew the voice of the song.
I sang the song that night, the melody the girls learned later.
I had it almost immediately and it was all terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but sure enough we needed the Divas.
She wouldn't have had the same strength with my voice.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too, it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There are no solos (except for a brief Judy Jay solo), they don't have a solo role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were backstage, too.
Is that what you want?
ZsB: The fact that they were in the background is due to technical problems alone.
But what was voluntary was that we didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we need to forget our ego a little bit, forget who's coming from where, who's going or, we just need to let these wings, the wings of love, carry us away.
I wanted others to feel the same euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs did you work on the most?
ZS: Actually, none of it was about the process of creating music, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing piano in concert, or with Rock 'n' Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
ZSB: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already released this record.
Right now, it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A fraud in disguise.
This is how the former employee of the French giant Societe Generale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka, is described.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems rather that Kerviel is just a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, can by no means be considered incapable.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market early.
"He's frail", suggested his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel's testimony reported by French media, including Le Monde, his transactions at the end of last year generated a profit of 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis extends beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he says in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to make half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity earlier this year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called sub-prime mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had had difficulties in repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in it, and he bet it well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it", says Kerviel, adding that he, of course, kept nothing to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to falsifying the reports to avoid detection.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
I'm not sure.
"I figured the mere fact of getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Why is he willing to risk so much?
He only got to his post gradually.
He had started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader, and in 2005, he became a freelance trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
But he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being treated far less favorably than others.
In view of my university education and my professional and personal background", Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he took office, however, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he made half a billion euros betting on the decline of that stock during the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect", he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As I won, they pretended to close their eyes".
But then the start of the new year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the money.
On Monday, when he gets to work, he's no longer a bank employee.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year I took only four days off.
A trader who does not take a holiday is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could bring EUR 14 billion (about CZK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Almost SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around CZK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most, up to 150 billion.
The transport programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be used to increase the budget of the National Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage a sum of 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, which is aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to raise funds to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The Czech Republic has so far been one of the least successful recipients of EU funds among new members.
The court upheld the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
Nicaragua's Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence of former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released and was placed under house arrest on his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former leader of the Central American state, who was in office from 1997 to 2002, will be imprisoned again is not yet clear, according to the AP.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officials, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court found that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign corporate accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been passed.
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been passed.
What is so special about this budget?
This is the first budget drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without the support of the opposition.
The one for this year was passed a year ago with the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
There's a paradox of sorts.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the power struggle between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive to the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more interesting to the public than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills which the present budget is not able to address at once:
The first is the large share of mandate costs imposed by law, which consists not only of pensions but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the public budget deficit, that is to say the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, the state budget deficit is not the biggest concern.
It is public and relatively controlled.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and towns.
Many mayors often issued bonds in a daze, putting their municipalities into excessive debt, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and bank loans.
In the past, they were able to repay these debts by selling off the shares in the distribution systems, particularly in the energy sector, which they had obtained from the State in the course of privatisations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts alone, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been in a growth phase for several years and ČSSD is not without its share of satisfaction.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regulate public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the State.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame which is mainly on the backs of previous governments.
We are among the countries with the least poverty risk in the world.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have unfortunately become unnecessarily inflated in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections has been removed, if the retirement age is not raised and the pension system is not reformed soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will be just administering.
It is no exaggeration to say that politicians in power will become bureaucrats who will distribute the majority of taxpayers' money between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the present budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism by which the ordinary expenses are replaced by the mandate expenses.
The deficit of 70 billion projected for 2008 would be absolutely pointless if the previous governments had not squandered all the money they could.
If we really do not want politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and duties, the necessary calm to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to achieve a balanced state budget gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
The banks will have to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Federal Reserve will auction off $40 billion and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual countries have decided on such a concerted action to prevent or even mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend", writes Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, a consultancy, in his report to clients.
"The concerted action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in bad loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in the billions.
"The central banks have chosen this approach because they really need to be aware of what is yet to come", says Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", he adds.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth worldwide.
The central banks made this choice after failure to lower the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as LIBOR, used for borrowing on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual lending, even though the US, Canadian and British central banks had repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem, which is the collapse of the US housing market.
President Klaus: The environmentalists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect particularly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time came at the UN international conference on climate change that is ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not the Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
Klaus said it was not only the structure of the conference, which was a curious mix of government and non-governmental representatives, that was unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, solutions to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book would also be published in German, since, he said, "I often find only caricatures of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus said that although he was not a climate scientist, he felt he had enough motivation to write such a book.
He is an academic who can follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, he says, the following: the climate is constantly changing, so changes in it are normal, there is no consensus among all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too severe, so they do not pose any danger, and finally, efforts to influence climate change are useless, inefficient and unacceptably expensive.
Especially since he has experience of totalitarian rule, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous encroachment on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into account the relationship between costs and profit".
Klaus had already spoken about this topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driving licence on time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driving licences, which expire at the end of the year.
This is the last day people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities can issue them a new license before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid licenses will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license especially those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities are reporting a drop in the number of applications for renewal of the permit, authorities in the capital are being overwhelmed with applications and the number of applications for renewal of the permit has been increasing this week.
The city hall serves about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a line of about half an hour.
In Prague, almost 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to issue a new licence.
However, it is possible to apply for a release within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional fee of five hundred kroner.
Drivers who fail to renew their driving licence by the end of the year and start driving without a valid licence will be fined from January.
The guilty party will be forced to pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence in a friendly manner.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is up to 2500 kroner.
According to old reports, even a person who was not going to drive was liable to a fine.
This could result in a fine of up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to exercise restraint and to impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, no one is at risk of fines in the tens of thousands.
He said that the driving licence is a document that people can decide whether they want to have or not.
It is not like an identity card, which must be valid without exception.
People who no longer wish to drive should hand in their driving licence.
You just have to bring it with you or send it to the relevant municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will expire at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also required to gradually renew other types of driving licence.
Those with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three years to renew them.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives who worked with Berdych.
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of colluding with David Berdych's gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The High Court in Prague therefore sentenced them to life imprisonment, reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, detectives from the Department of Combating Organized Crime faced sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal the judgment given today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently awaiting the verdict of the trial court.
However, he has already received sentences in other cases totaling more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the departmental court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, the Superior Court was today dealing with the objections of appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants questioned the accusation from the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the police, after an agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed on information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the various robberies and helped the gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the stolen goods to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges relate to the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
The main cases are armed robberies, in which the victims have, in most cases, suffered serious damage to their health, but also the abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During house searches, the police found illegal handguns, steel-cores, a laser sight, and a submachine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has amassed tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from about 20 men from that trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a host of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the courthouse.
The main hearing has for the time being avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The cost of child surrogacy: 12 million
The lawyer for the families of the victims, Igor Veleba, wants the Třebíč hospital to pay 12 million crowns plus costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the hospital lawyer Ondřej Dostál is absolutely against Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a demand, it is very, very high", Dostál said as the court was leaving.
"To be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned.
We'll see if this one has any explanatory value.
But we still think the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands", Dostál said.
The amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonoff's family demanded one million kroner for every month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress of varying degrees and depth.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, although they were faced with regrets for not preventing the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less calm about the trauma they have experienced in the news and what is happening at this very moment, the Veleba report summarised.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on December 9th.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina region Miloš Vystrčil gave each family 100,000 kroner at the end of October to reimburse the expenses caused by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask the manager for help.
Until now, the courts have awarded relatively small amounts of compensation, with the amounts calculated from the tables ranging from hundreds of thousands to exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost the Kingdom of Valašsko
The Bolek Polívka lost the case concerning the trade mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was indeed the first to use the title King of Valašsko, but the project was put together by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the actor's former collaborator.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
But his lawyer says the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabiš and his team parasitizing on Bolek Polívka's popularity", Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Valašsko Kingdom evoke to everyone this actor and comedian.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"Finding money and setting up events", he said.
He thinks the problem is money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his TV show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
But at that time, it was not about setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing passports from Valašské Království.
From a humorous action it grew into a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to have his name and signature on the passport and even offered to sell the sale of his farm and theater performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the show manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project", the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between the now hostile parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I, elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, a claim that the court has now rejected.
What might shed light on the matter is the proposed tournament for the throne and half the princess.
There should be a new king.
He didn't want to give away the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to rush into business.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register", added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: elimination of prejudices
I'll be honest, I was never a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of the gear change, the handling and also the manufacturing could in many respects be described as below average.
The successor to the Peugeot 207 is now on the market, and it is much better.
Especially since the SW-combo goes one step further, I have to think harder.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback I complained about the headroom in the backseat.
But that's it for the complaints because the combi body means even the big devils will be comfortable with it.
Let 's see it done .
I'm going to go very quickly to the inside so I don't repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, my only comment being the central tunnel which I find poor.
I would have liked a more inventive design here, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days of complaining about too short seats or folders are over.
The lateral guidance has also been significantly improved compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in body size is also noticeable here.
The combi also eliminates the lack of space above the head mentioned earlier.
A chest in the chest
So the most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I must say that this one is very accessible (also thanks to the back swinging glass) and quite easy to attach.
Blind spots are fitted with restraint bands which are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be stretched out while still being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's just focus on the volume.
The tables show that the basic configuration of the car produces 428 litres, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we see that the Peugeot is very noticeably behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or to loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the box remaining after the reversal of the backs of the perfectly straight rear seats, or else a very low footrest.
120 horsepower on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 litres and a power output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1.6 should look like that runs a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it consumes little and, most importantly, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often looks like it has an exhaust plugged by a moped, then I can only be excited.
Let's go through the rates.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a car that is quite well equipped, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine of 329 900 CZK is still reasonable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410,900 Kč, which is enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, raises the price by 80,000 cents.
We also have head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic control of the rear windows.
In reality, the vehicle costs 531,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
So all that's left is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which is causing concern among the remainder about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
Schools in Britain have even seen cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants have turned violent.
The case of North Kent, where conflicts between immigrants and Slovak residents are becoming more acute, illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the bullying and the fighting between the students have translated into the relations between the parents.
The situation got so bad that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old schoolboy with a bar of iron.
The offender defended herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks and threw stones at the man.
"On the way home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he uncovered his ass", described another unpleasant experience a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One survivor even went so far as to describe the conflict with the immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the natives and the immigrants is beginning to tense.
70 000 Slovaks who came to Britain to find work are registered.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make the right choice.
Gold-white beaches, high waves, or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering you pizza, ice cream, and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you will find this list not only complete but enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more, and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the days of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of the Americas.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the storehouse and transshipment point for the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was built by Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under Prohibition) was allowed and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra. He was a great guy.
In Havana, high-rise buildings have sprung up and cars, which were cult symbols of the 1950's, have been driving along the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought property in San Francisco from Paula, near Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
Stars from the entertainment industry and politicians from all over America were signing their names on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be served the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still in Havana, because the jiguulis and the fiats once imported have long since rotted in such a salty and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there so many splendid colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places are getting more beautiful, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money when needed, its development is a green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on smaller islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another fantasy that is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by lovers of small trains.
The cane had been brought from the plantations spread out in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and engine trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and so small locomotives, of which only museums have contemporaries, can be seen running.
Where to direct his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
But remember that Hemingway's estate, mentioned earlier, has a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
There is lush vegetation on limestone soil.
The valley floor is littered with cinder blocks, limestone balloons, and rocks, and even the rotting rocks are covered with a dense vegetation, with fertile soil seeping into their bowels.
The valley is probably where the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see the final shape of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
Other
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and character of this small city-showcase.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlements, has almost changed in the last four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is so isolated that even in the 1950s there were no roads connecting this region to the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay out of the way.
We didn't build, and that's why we didn't tear down, and everybody was content with having a roof over their head.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is also worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón or the Valley of the Sucreries.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which gets lively after sunset and where the music is not heard until the early morning.
Other
Some have called this small town on the far eastern tip of Cuba the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the road leading to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo to the site must pass through high, rugged mountains and through a landscape with almost no traces of human activity.
The eastern Cuban stork has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its pristine landscape.
The best chocolate is made there, the church has the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was built about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the current El Castillo Hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba, Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by descendants of former slaves - all of these could fill pages.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, say the Americans
The lack of troops and equipment is affecting the way the US mission in Afghanistan is being conducted.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, officials from countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for increased NATO troop activity, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid as a priority.
"The developments in Afghanistan are noticeable, but military might can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new economic and security development themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
Violent incidents increased by 27 percent from the previous year, to 60 percent in Helmand province in the south.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
The United States, however, felt that the Allies had reached their absolute limit in both organization and equipment.
In particular, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the period ahead, as well as ways to achieve them", Gates said.
The European Union is now in a position to take a decision on the future of the European Union.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that is not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
The last few months have also seen conflicts between the countries involved over whether all the allies are really doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"The lazy Afghans are exposed: the Germans play, while ours fight", Sun wrote in a document supplemented with photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild retaliated by publishing a photo of a British troop at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will rise to 1 trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt of over 84,000 CZK is borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
The Ministry reduced the amount of the budget to 152.8 billion kroner, as the state budget was better than expected.
The Czech Republic's national debt rose to 842.7 billion CZK at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
However, as of June, it has fallen by SEK 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the national debt from early October.
The burden of a debt of over 84,000 CZK falls on every Czech.
The State has borrowed more than 111 billion kroner in the last year.
"At the moment, it seems that, with a smaller deficit foreseen for next year, the one trillion-krone mark could be exceeded in 2009 alone.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion kroner", said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the server iHNed.cz.
The forecast by Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed the trillion by the end of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it appears that the political situation is changing, that politicians are willing to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I do not expect this change", he said.
Debt is rising
The national debt is the central government's debt and is mainly the result of the accumulation of deficits in the national budget.
The government debt is financed by Treasury bills, annuities, direct borrowing or, for example, by borrowing from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt of the State has so far this year increased from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The external debt of the State has increased this year from the current 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroner from June.
The average debt to GDP ratio was 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased year on year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which is far too high, given the current good health of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly driven by annuities, where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be some negotiating material when the pension reform comes", Pikora said of the data.
Better than we expected
This follows from the 2007 State debt financing and management strategy, which envisaged the government borrowing 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, as a result of better than expected progress in the state budget savings, the Ministry reduced the amount planned to 152.8 billion kroner.
The amount is mainly the state budget deficit which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns originally planned.
The Commission has also decided to grant a loan of EUR 10 billion to the Czech Consolidation Agency, which will be used to finance the financing of the pension scheme.
She was appearing today in a court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six- to seven-year-old schoolchildren name a teddy bear after Muhammad, even though any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a punishment of flogging.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, ages 6 and 7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the classroom.
Eight names come out of the children's mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the caption My name is Mohamed.
The bear itself had no label with that name on it, but the problem is simply that the depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that would insult a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name", he said, "it's just an innocent mistake".
Many of the teacher's students share her viewpoint, describing her as "very attentive to her students" and "never talking about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most common name in Britain, spelled in English in 14 different ways.
This name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of the name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last session of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status, European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was at stake, his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
We are not planning violence immediately but we are entering a very difficult period, he added, noting that there are obvious tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian-speaking, may become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final round of negotiations since the troika was given a new mandate to mediate by the UN last August.
The US and European countries consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo at the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution, said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Declaration of independence from the United States?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina says it is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached, said President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority Fatmir Sejdiu at the hotel in Baden, where last-ditch negotiations have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to killings and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be left exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be made in consultation with the West.
Bush tears up an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "road map" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, chaired by Abbas, would aim "to conclude a peace treaty that resolves all outstanding issues without exception, including the core issues".
The term covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "comprehensive and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Olmert, in turn, took the stand and vowed that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states" - Palestinian and Israeli - to coexist by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this effect from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
The Arab world, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi Arabian-language daily.
The prosecutor says the cops are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in all cases of this kind, official accounts and rumors are conflicting.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspection Générale de la Police Nationale (IGPN), a police car was driving Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on the rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
She was not on patrol, but on duty, and was travelling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophone, a police source said.
A Kawazaki green motorcycle, not registered, so not allowed to drive on public roads (see below) and driven by two youths without helmets, was travelling very fast.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a right-handed refusal of priority", says a police officer.
The blood alcohol level of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (front smashed, windshield starburst, bumper ripped off) shows how violent the impact was.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into "facts of involuntary homicide and failure to assist anyone in danger" to the IGPN, which is attached to the departmental directorate of public security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the police version, namely that the mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left.
Yesterday, a groove, probably caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were entangled until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical examination.
Both victims' bodies were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have left the scene very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out any serious misconduct on this point.
This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which one must be very careful, a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness in the moments after the accident.
One of his windows looking precisely at the stage.
We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, says the witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a policeman who was completely lame, limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the youngsters, the fourth was on the phone.
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty of those present about the young people's hopeless situation, the police were driven by colleagues who arrived on the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue team arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also tried heart massages, but to no avail.
I will not allow it to be said that the police services have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
Firefighters came right away.
Everything was done to try to save them, the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first protests since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring some police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police shot and wounded lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar Association called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other protests were reported in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement was backed on Monday by the religious parties of the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose chairman 'called on the people to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and trash to those who swore allegiance to Musharraf''.
'Musharraf's promise is no longer valid'
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
It was due to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election on 6 October by indirect ballot.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
'Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings,' the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to step down as army chief and become a civilian president 'is no longer valid' after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
Today, more than one in three pregnancies (36 percent) is still unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute of Population Studies (INED), 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed that made contraception legal in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and unplanned or unexpected births.
The INED estimates that the failure rate of different contraceptive methods, such as the pill or the IUD, is still 5 to 6 percent.
The institute notes that the use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5 percent in 1970 to 60 percent today.
And eight out of ten births today would be well planned.
It is estimated that about one in five couples will have a baby every month, and preferably in the spring, the season considered best for having a baby.
The spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, vital to the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky outing that has set records for its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was conceived, the tools  handcrafted  by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece of spacecraft that will soon house European and Japanese science laboratories.
This module is a kind of docking station for the lab modules.
But we have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5-ton solar power module already on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began re-deploying the module's 76-meter-wide solar arrays.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged by a cable that got stuck for almost a meter.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally scheduled to make a control exit from the shuttle Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel that had a faulty rotation system, were forced to focus on the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go to the end of the 100-foot long remote control arm of the shuttle that was added to the station's to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, tough, very skilled, with a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor was assigned to  operate  the solar panel  injured .
After carefully inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed some sort of  splints  on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the airlock and, from inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electric shock on solar panels that generated several hundred volts, was designed and crafted  by the astronauts on board the station.
When the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the shuttle Discovery for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS securities listed on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defence group announced it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS is currently losing 4% at 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to revise its operating result forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which conditioned the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which over €1 billion for Airbus', said the parent company of European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating profit targets (EBIT) for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, it added without giving further figures.
The Group also states that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
The operating result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the very large A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the polls: Russians will overwhelmingly vote for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general election, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the voters today with a message on public television, already recorded but kept secret.
He does so as the leader of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party that is predicted to win a landslide.
Yesterday, the president made no such statement when he received foreign ambassadors, merely issuing a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his favorite campaign theme.
 We know the price of true democracy and we want the most honest, transparent and open elections, without any glitches, he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far from out of the picture.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennady Ziuganov says there have never been such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time.
After the crackdown on protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains barred from visiting, according to his lawyer.
 The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus 
Behind these uncertain legislative elections lie two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to announce themselves.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor has emerged.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
 Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel in control of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: Civil society in this Christian country lagged behind five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s,  Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, which was accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror but by a certain economic ease,  says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians are willingly renouncing the personal responsibility they had briefly shown after the collapse of the USSR.
Why think about it?
This phenomenon affects all social groups, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional heads) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
Which is why the Russians won't vote for extremists either.
The conclusion of 54-year-old teacher Tamara Cherednitchenko:  What good is it to think?
The people in power are not so bad, why change them?
A painful memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which record the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are now open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on a 27 km line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were previously only accessible for  humanitarian  purposes, i.e. on an individual and nominative basis, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The 11 countries responsible for their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them up to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of the agreement by all States is complete and the opening of the Convention has been in effect since yesterday.
The information shall be sensitive.
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research  on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of forced labourers , explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public disclosure of such personal data, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some of the deportation victims.
The Gestapo's records of concentration camps and arrest warrants were compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to locate civilians deported or forced to work and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, so as to pave the way for compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees still handle tens of thousands of individual claims.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest to some in the scientific community.
 There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents, said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to reach free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between India and Europe is already close to 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the go-ahead last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
"A free trade pact would be a huge boost to both economies" and "India would have better access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", explained Peter Mandelson.
The European Commissioner said that Europe is the first or second market for each of India's top ten exports.The Asian and European giants trade annually for "€47 billion in goods" and for "€10 billion in services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, this week, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential".The EU and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President Manuel José Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns by offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was keen to alleviate the current return of credit concerns and announced an unusually long offer of £10 billion at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks.
The Bank's main objective is to provide a financial intermediary with a liquidity base of at least EUR 500 million, which is the equivalent of EUR 500 million in the case of the Bank's assets.
The bank said 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) would be put on the market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT at the base rate until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has put five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are usually done within a week.
The Bank of England added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of day-to-day interbank lending in line with its base rate.
The overnight interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a high penalty rate which had discouraged banks from using them.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the pound against the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to rejecting the text.
The text, which was drafted in a socialist "niche" (a meeting initiated by a parliamentary group), included about a dozen measures adopted by the PS national bureau on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the reintroduction of the floating TIPP, a transport check and rent controls.
The UMP and NC voted against the articles (180 votes to 115), and the sitting was adjourned after the general discussion which led to a sometimes lively exchange of views between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would represent the entirety of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill being considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival Is Born
Following many rumors about C3 Presents' creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with someone who has nothing but inspiration for the current festival movement in America", Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produced the Chicago Lollapalooza and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes outside Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic's director Melvin Benn is one of the world's most respected festival producers.
In 1989 he took over the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now seats up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he's ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in tandem to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", says Charlie Jones.
We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have become bogged down in political trickery because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
Luckily, we've been able to talk to Melvin Benn and we're about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.
C3 Presents resurrected Lollapalooza in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having made a mark on the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours is more urban green spaces, says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to somehow merge the two formulas to give both a European-style country festival and an American-style urban festival.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event, says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that will hopefully have a long life.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very big", just like the 80,000-person capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been sent out to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences", says Charlie Jones.
His partners on C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing off against the Terminator .
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when nobody but the Terminator is against it.
This seduction mission is part of the delegate's duties.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "runaway productions".
Is it hard to play the Governor's leg?
We have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best", he says.
The Race to the Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The Oscars race is on.
All the festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about showcasing Quebec films, promoting them and making sure that the directors do interviews.
Dark Ages had a great showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is showing in Santa Monica and will premiere at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a stock market rally at the end of the year?
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year rally.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "statistically, December is generally positive for the stock market.
However, forecasts should not be based solely on statistics, as the current environment is one of uncertainty in the markets, at least in the short term".
While they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum in the final weeks of the year, they note that "the stock market is fuelled by the availability of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of the flight to quality securities in both long and short periods".
They believe that the stock market will behave rather laterally, not free from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely Fed rate cut is unknown, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI's sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
"This is not the best thing", says the expert.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost almost 4 percent since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes the Ibex 35 could end the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur each year on these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a bit different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day bridge (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a reversal in the index which could be triggered by the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum heights.
Solana of Intermoney says that "this year the big values are back for him".
The expert said the portfolio included the two major banks and a few construction companies "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says the increases will be a blow to the banking and industrial sectors.
Manufacturers will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow suit", explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the main focus in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it very well too, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month only twice.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, the Ibex 35 has recovered by 28.17% and December has risen by 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (the Ibex has so far risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds on its year-end rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 are banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the brand name Populaire Max, represent a major change for the bank.
The same applies to the rest of the Spanish agencies, since they are the first group to start betting on their offices being open continuously until 8.30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 to 8.30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeatedly stated that it would like to expand the opening hours of its branches is BBVA, although it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He's about to make a deal with the unions to close 75 percent of his offices on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for whether or not other organizations will join this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely the aim of the People's Bank.
Attract self-employed customers who travel to these areas to shop in the SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not opening new branches but renovating existing ones.
To this end, the agency will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more modern design with brighter colours.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, says the renovation does not involve large investments but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per branch.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The People's Bank has already tested its initiative in three branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches on Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid were the streets chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others, under the brand of Mundocredit, specialised in immigrants, also with very wide opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax branches they will not copy the model of BBVA, where several of its branches have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3's market value for the first time
We did it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a senior advisor at Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the close of the stock market when he found that the channel he runs was worth twice as much as its rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was clouded: 'What hurts me is not that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, "we have fallen less".
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This gain stabilises its loss to 15.66% for the year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (up 13%) thus reaches EUR 4 488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which dropped 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half that, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
Vasile says the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television station to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the chief advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising subsidiary of the group.
For this figure to be realistic, the TV channel should see a 3.6% increase in its advertising bills for the current financial year compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
Net revenues of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million) while net revenues of television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for Telecinco's relative best performance on the stock market is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have an official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already given equity with the 33% of Endemol.'
Analysts say the market is showing signs of fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates for Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to lower projected income growth from 10.5 to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 to 5.1 percent in 2009.
The same company reduced the profit forecast for Antenne 3 to 4,5% in 2008 and to 7,5% in 2009.

The Congress approves the transposition of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of bodies for the efficient functioning of markets.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, strengthening investor protection, enhancing the powers of the heads of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various heads of the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided for both specialised social reasons and to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (FSI), financial advisory firms (FAs), which merge with securities companies, stockbrokers and portfolio management companies.
It also increases the number of systems for executing transactions in financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which compete with current stock exchange managers, can be added to the regulated secondary markets.
The law also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a register of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
The Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress passed several amendments, one of which emphasizes that secured debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, as demonstrated by what happened with the debt of US subprime mortgages.
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977 was approved, the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the ombudsman, who will work for a company, who will not require authorisation from the CNMV and who will be able to lend his services of marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index rose by five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat then uses to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same methodology as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data to be revealed on 14 December.
'The CPI will continue at relatively high levels'
The second vice-president and Minister for the Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1 per cent increase in the CPI in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there were fewer surprises" than in the previous month, when the Government did not face such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4 per cent", the Minister for the Economy said in relation to the figure announced today.
Virgin plans to recover €42,000 million from Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50 per cent to £12 billion (€16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he had some record deposits of over £25 million, a figure which is gradually falling in two and a half months because of the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organisation with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the income from British banks that will be deposited over the next three years to get the remaining £18 billion until the £30 billion target is reached.
The wealthy Richard Branson Group, known for its high-profile advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend £50 million (about $70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin partnership's bid, which includes three other companies, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (of the Popular Party) early this morning because of his alleged connection to the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, a right-wing member of parliament who was previously a city councillor, and who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by SER, could be the 'leader' of this plot.
Officers are continuing to search city and city hall premises and the possibility of further arrests is not excluded in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption scheme, discovered earlier this week, was indicted.
As SER Channel reported yesterday to the lawyer of the 'people's party' member Juan Morales, he was arrested as he left Morales' home with important documentation in his possession related to the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to redevelop 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer from the President of the Government and the General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the Socialist Party's list for Toledo for the next general election and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general election.
The Spanish Socialist Party's organisational secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting with Zapatero at the party's federal headquarters this afternoon.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister because "it's important to rely on the best" in politics and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the Manche politician will be the Socialist Group candidate to chair the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, which on November 15 announced its decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon its political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the academic field.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned it two years ago.
He also noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If elected, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or scream" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one cannot talk quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times".
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his skill" and he did not want to pretend he already held his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Propaganda for the Climate
Since the climate change movement is subjecting to relentless persecution both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially true for a movement leader who is the president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges it to explain why the action or inaction of its government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the forefront of the European Union in non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it occurred and why his government, the one with the contract with the planet, did not prevent it.
The Commission has also been asked to explain to the Spanish people what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to change, what individual and collective energy savings will be required, what economic consequences will this have.
I mean, who will sacrifice themselves and pay to save the planet.
But there was no explanation and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it involves sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to corporate and individual accounts.
The essence of the Spanish Socialist Party seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he quickly denied it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans with no real consequences.
With phrases that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
I hope that this will be limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and not to requiring us to ride a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
Totana Mayor and Police Chief arrested for alleged urban corruption
Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcia town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, sources in the investigation said today.
The councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at that time many officers were gathered, who also went to the Municipal Councillor's Office of Urban Planning and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid in an operation to convert more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into urban areas so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 houses, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but are being charged in the judicial investigation, which is being investigated by the Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees were released today.
According to the sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently independent MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the target of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly paid.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the area, who may have been the intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of reclassified land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo's car parks in the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

If they don't mind, we'll leave the Book of the Month to rest, see if in the meantime we can think of any other ideas.
I'm already thinking of something.
Life is change.
Of course, you're welcome to come up with inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly the PISA news top in the world), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn's book review was published there, curiously:
"The content of the Philosophy course has been a matter of public concern following the tragedy at Jokela school.
The culprit, a college student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Councillor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude toward Plato on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he claimed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools".

A colleague passes information on the introduction of the offence of Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a prison term of six months to one year.
In contrast, theft from a CD shop for less than 400 euros is only considered a misdemeanor (Article 623.1).
B. Theft from a store of up to €1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than for loading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for loading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to be involved in a fight than to be involved in the trafficking of CDs.
Participating in a violent brawl carries a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs would carry a sentence of six months to two years
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009.
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to Section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, then someone is exaggerating.

My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research, entitled 'Money Makes the Brain Work, Especially When Others Get Less.'
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly salary of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the neurocognitive imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were getting the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them got double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required that much science.
The prosecutor in the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former general Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list, which is the title of the documentary by Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach, 'Carla's List' (2006, not shown exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York, who tracks fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the driver's license, civil status, type of vehicle insured or use, and others.
Having a car is the main thing.
It is even more difficult to choose the right car insurance than to choose the right model of vehicle.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is made in the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the premium and in return becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by various factors, such as age, gender, driving licence age, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the premium.
For this reason, people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their caution.
Similarly, using surveys, companies have concluded that married drivers tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must carefully consider the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will outline the most important variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it not only adapts to the insurer's characteristics but also offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face a number of disadvantages when purchasing affordable insurance, such as low driving experience and long driving licenses.
Although the ideal insurance policy is a risk-free policy, there are other cheaper options.
The more prudent drivers can choose to take out a risk-free policy with confidence, so that they can get the coverage of a risk-free policy at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the claim amount.
"The part of the claim amount that the customer pays will be determined by the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, the head in Spain of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer insures protection against damage caused to third parties, but not for those caused to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
I'll give you a piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may lower the price of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic fare of the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses", explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced by accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to choose a risk-free insurance policy with honesty.
"Young people usually don't get the benefit of the experience they have gained after an accident", says the European company's manager in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, after the 'fear of the novice' is over.
However, if the customer is married but has no children yet, it is preferable to negotiate an all-risk insurance policy, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the ones with the lowest claims rate, because the premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deductible (up to EUR 300), or an extended third party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more relaxed driving and they have more purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchisees", says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, an all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (at €150), or an extended third party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it is a considerable expense, so it is essential to properly study the insurance that is most suitable for us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will be looking to win a point in Milan to reach the quarter-finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow will face off at San Siro next Tuesday to find the point they are missing to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as it is up to the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have 10 points and they have already qualified on the fifth day with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who have six, and Benfica, who have four, do not get ahead of them.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as AC Milan are due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on 13th of this month in search of a place in the final on 16th December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most anticipated outcome, although both teams will try to come out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow know that by winning they will remain first and ensure a better crossover in the last eight.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it cannot count on that alone as the game is nine points behind the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct match.
Milan will try to poison the evening against Scotland, who are hoping to qualify for the last eight for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten in the last edition by a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0).
While waiting for the Rossoneri to win, the only triumph would be for Shakhtar, if Celtic lost, to qualify for the last eight to continue in the UEFA Champions League.
And that is that Benfica, although they are last and without any chances to continue in European competition, could reach third place with a win.
20,000 people in Vancouver for first Spice Girls concert tour
The Spice Girls opened in Vancouver, Canada, before an audience of about 20,000, their first tour since the group broke up in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before the start of their show at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out of tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that was a hit in the late 1990s.
The meeting and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that includes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five Spice Girls took the stage to show off the bracelets that were given to them by Posh Spice's husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days before.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "hasn't seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he'll think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' who left the band in 1998 "due to differences between us" and who caused the band to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness in an interview with the press two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings had changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision", Chisholm said of the group's meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
She also noted that in time, "things have settled down and we're really enjoying each other".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
First, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, they found an army of babysitters waiting for them.
She had five sons and seven daughters.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is alarming.
A dispute over gas prices is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of a spillover effect on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are carried by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's monopoly gas company, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned as it agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan in 2008.
Analysts said that this would mean a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
 It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes, Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
 Fluctuations in gas costs are probably linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine 
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused the interruption of Gazprom's supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, which in turn led to higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplies its own gas with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Union nations in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Department of Health needs to improve the checks on its extra-Community employees to check for criminal records, the monitoring committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was implicated in the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Department of Health had no precise figures on the number of overseas workers it employed.
However, his report highlighted other crucial checks, which were properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General has been conducting checks on extra-Community staff following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after he drove his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of being involved in various attempted car bombings in the UK.
The Department of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Department of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out criminal record checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Criminal Record Office, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
 Although we found that some information about staff was checked, this was not always done.  says the report.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Department of Health does most of the pre-employment checks that it would do itself, but he also added:  our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said: 'The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can provide any added value.'
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor-General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems in identifying staff with permanent contracts who may or may not choose to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities' controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service staff.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport. 
She added that the Scottish Government, in partnership with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings in the report due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better enforcement of the recently updated pre-employment checks for all employees, including overseas workers.
Joy Division is dominating the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on the late Joy Division singer Ian Curts, won five awards, including best picture, at the British Independent Film Awards.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-starring Toby Kebbell.
Mrs. Judi Dench was named best actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal".
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, won the Variety Award for bringing British film into the international spotlight.
The awards were handed out during the ceremony at London's Round house.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, up until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film, which features music by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just £3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, one for Best Director and the other for Best New Director.
The Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has directed films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of the star of Harris, who starred in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney made it possible for people like me to have access to cinema", he said.
I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored 
The Independent Film Awards, better known as  the Bifas  are awarded by a jury made up of directors, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 fearsome plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday announced that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells planning an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
State television in the world's biggest oil exporter said one of the cells smuggled missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have staged a campaign against the US-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV news reported.
Saudi Arabia quickly assembled a 35,000-strong force to protect the sites, following a failed 2006 Al Qaeda attack on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement from the interior minister, saying that 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a  missile launch expert  who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees were allegedly involved in the plot to assassinate clergymen and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudis-led in Iraq, to join al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, considered heretical by the Sunni Saudi hardline.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
"Important efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months", the interior ministry spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina who are organized into a  media cell  aimed at promoting  Takfiri thought , the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that advocates the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to Earth's, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect from carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion from solar radiation, coupled with a slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is without water, ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The findings of the Venus Express probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a bleak glimpse of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said:  We are beginning to understand why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
 Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have originally been identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface. 
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people have been arrested and the material is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise was worth $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to anything
Mitt Romney has declared himself unfit to answer a snowman's questions as a presidential candidate.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the YouTube debate, during which many ordinary voters recorded their questions and submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one from another YouTube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, which is running in the next election.
It's unclear what criteria the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the YouTube clips to show to the would-be candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest ever on a single topic, focused on immigration.
It's one of the strongest issues for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke in a rude way.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
Both fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote an "amnesia" (giving illegal immigrants a regular status and the opportunity to become citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have managed to dig deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has the chance to be elected, but both of them are staying in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration earlier and more forcefully than the others.
In general, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, along with concerns about toxic toys made in China and other fears about the outside world, has led Republicans to forget or downplay the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the gun control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to boldly declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure if he believes the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have supported capital punishment.
It was not to be expected that Mike Huckabee, who was in the lead in Iowa in a recent election because of his longstanding Christian conservatism, would declare that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would have been favored, he laughed and said that Jesus was too handsome to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to anything.
Mr. Huckabee's ascent to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant seeking led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two party proteges cannot agree on who is the more well-known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate unified the party early and convincingly with a successful message of American greatness bringing leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the working class
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigns, the situation will not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital sucking toes.
But now a revelation that a wealthy businessman had hidden for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to over £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party did not declare: another battle that Gordon Brown would have gotten away with.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked on his election plan, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls had not influenced his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown had turned from Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of bankruptcy, demonstrated a flaw in the guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals for a change in the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the IRS has revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a rebellion in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending. They have proclaimed that being Secretary of State for Defence is for them a part-time job.
At the moment, suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour General Secretary (and his former head of vigilance) have forced them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is bound to head for the exit.
But governments can get to a point where it is impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually put their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for long, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are being assessed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and has no further objective.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation into party funds  cash for members of the House of Lords , voters might think otherwise.
But Mr Brown's predicament is not as tragic as it seems.
The blunders are not as monstrous as Tory Party members make them out to be.
Just like Mr. Bean, there are no victims and no scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to put into practice Mr Brown's longstanding Stalinist tendencies for a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The recent political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular character who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his own opinion, but it's not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of big donors to politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams's programmes, without knowing that they were illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raiser manager who spoke of the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown has not been involved: there is no indication that he was aware of these moves, even though most of the payments were made after he joined the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He was quick to condemn his party's legislative flaw, but he failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, to call upon a committee of inquiry on this subject made up of a retired bishop and a judge.
In that case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's the police's responsibility.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Standards Committee on Public Life, which has been without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform of political party finances.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead to it giving up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr Brown.
But he should face some favorable facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good electoral advantage; it has two years to win back the electorate, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Could the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see fins flailing around.
Now that the U.S. housing market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
There are obvious signs of tension.
There are increases in the rates of fees and insolvency, which measures the parts of the balance sheet that are not recoverable or are, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer loans, partly because of weak cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody's, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89 percent is almost one percentage point below its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if loan conditions worsened.
The industry also advertises fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of debt consumers have to pay each month.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct contagion links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair housing loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to asset value, and so the fall in property prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer mortgage premiums fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan, so credit card debt would become a priority for paying it off.
Card issuers are able to respond much more quickly and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions than mortgage lenders, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid stock recovery.
We're not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans", said Gary Perlin, CEO of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe of the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a substantial decline.
If lower house prices and a contraction in the credit market push America into recession, the industry will certainly face a grim future.
Watch out for the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify in connection with a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their plea to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich himself at the expense of their employees.
They're due in court in January.
But at a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain because of the extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an open question for this investigation, which began after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three", state that they came to Houston in 2000 to stage a fraudulent script with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind behind many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the branch as zero, but in fact the three Britishmen already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's interest in the subsidiary for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in reality, that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers were paid $7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and the others were paid $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in a Texas prison.
The three British nationals were released on bail of $1 million each, which requires them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest national corporation, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting fraud, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its bogus speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion in lost market value and over $2 billion in lost pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their involvement in the company's collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were dropped because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Not a penny, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But that's just a small change for some Russians.
 It can carry up to 18 passengers  said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
Even though no one really needs so many seats as it is more of a family plane or for the president of a company .
Mr. Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, a four-day consumer-encouragement orgy held at a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to attract the interest of the newly rich Russians for their varied products, from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like 50 Cent's.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche on display next to his booth.
 it's a nice car, but nothing like our product he said.
 After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets .
 Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas 
 We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic, said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are trying to find their place in the Klondike.
In another location in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference saw Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault exchange ideas on the strategy for selling luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth a combined $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth trends in the former Soviet Union by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
 There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we are all here  said Nicole Marais, a representative of London jeweler Davis Morris.
She was at the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, The Jewelry Group of Soho.
 Women are all well-dressed and men are worth a fortune 
Walking through the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, grabbing her high-fashion dress like a red-carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to queue through traffic jams to a huge warehouse that displays Cadillac Escalades, platinum knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
 Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands  said Mr Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch Porcelain Factory's Delft booth, in front of a hand-painted mural of Raimbrant on blue tiles.
 it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling 
Indeed, the sellers here said that Russians with old capital (10-15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Yet, thousands of people - millionaires, emissaries of millionaires, and tourists - walk through the exhibition every day.
And some even buy it.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershow, CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold thread.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager of A1 Motorcycle, a company that equips cars with the latest alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire the bright orange Porsche for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said it would sell three bracelet-like cars for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a cartoon wheel designed for a Russian casino owner who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four is $22,000.
The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires said Mr. Karapetian.
He's probably gonna keep it in his garage, which already holds 30 or 40 vehicles.
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase  Russian millionaire  is not on the agenda given the rise in property prices here.
 if you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash  he said.
 there are more than you might think 
Those who are not millionaires can at least experience this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company erected four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire show.
Passersby stopped throwing lots of bills, asking their friends to take pictures on their cell phones, in the midst of this fake wealth or pocketing a few million.
 you see, here in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire, Mr. Karyev said.
Unlicensed surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey.
It was Thanksgiving Eve when Ronald Livingston was looking out the window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and saw an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol came.
And then another one.
 Then I saw the ambulance stop  Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities later learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant superintendent of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of her death was due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, who police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicology tests, which, unfortunately, will take time, but should help solve this mysterious death that has saddened the highest levels of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to the Chief of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious", McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
She was like a pit bull
 she would have done anything to protect me 
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Liquor Control Board, and is survived by two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for the Union County Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgery.
 It's a possibility to consider. 
 the investigation is continuing. 
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3:00 p.m.
And finding Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead.
A little over a week has passed since then, and authorities have said little about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if any part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door to Miss Castro's house where a withered rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue canister called  Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes lay in a hangar next to a door leading to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
She said, "You have to be careful about this".
She was there when I came in, and she was there when I left.
 It was embarrassing 
Everyone is hoping that the Federal Reserve will lower rates in the wake of the global stock market bubble.
Stocks exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates spurred by the soothing statements of the US central bank's vice president.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second only to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that decision makers must be  flexible and pragmatic  in their actions in the turbulent financial markets.
In an apparent effort to reassure the volatile markets in the face of new credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had partly reversed some improvements in market performance in late September and October.
If this severe turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigid financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments are seen by investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These comments also helped to calm Wall Street with even worse news about the US economy, such as the biggest drop in property sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was exacerbated by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would lay off 650 people, or 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses from losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2, adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit difficulties on the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for an auction of monthly tri-monthly funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a hefty rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject additional funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, have caused the UK banks' monthly borrowing rates  Libor to grow at their highest since September last year, to 6.59% after a sharp rise since 12 November.
England is facing a court appeal over the criticism of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the number six batsman for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And more importantly in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the coaching staff who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make their decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the chairman and chief executive of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Whoever doesn't manage to win the number six backpack will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sports.
It is never easy to destroy what allows one man to rise to the top of his profession while another will never rise above the bottom, sometimes by lack of luck rather than by lack of skill.
It's not just cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment is subjective.
Is this a good time to bring Bopara out?
Is that fair compared to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee  tubby ? both new executives with good qualifications, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the fair standard of a cricketer unless he is given at least a chance?
Numbers are important in decisions, but so are opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain, at the same time he has to take the goal and a batsman has to be lucky to hit the one-day cricketer.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison was in good form and continued to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 overs to earn a place.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their glory days at the highest level and hope to deliver more.
Whether it's Shah or Bopara who plays at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
It could ruin or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every Test and did well in the first, with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the first Test cricketer, and that despite the fact that his double century against Australia in Australia may still be underrated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greater experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
To Shah's credit, his brilliant and considerable start in the 88 Test innings in Mumbai, 32 first-class centuries against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent batting.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord's, his Middlesex home town, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was back in shape, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Mumbai.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy of life.
He is not afraid of anything on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently overturned a 4x4 at a presentation of Volkswagen, the British sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, although the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from a distance, to ask if  'he had seen this? 
Bopara is by far the best batsman, his pace allows him to make good deliveries, and he bats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
I'd be willing to give Bopara a chance, but that doesn't mean Shah can't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dropping off these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight the militants who drove them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned on their own.
 I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad  said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
 I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now. 
They say the Mahdi army is not committing crimes anymore! he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, which has ordered its men to withdraw for the time being.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-backed militia had helped drive Al Qaeda out of the western part of the capital, and invited him to return home.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who was forced to leave his home north of Baghdad after a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back and fight.
 Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys. 
 That is why I am coming back today said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troops arrived, and the continuing training of  groups of involved citizens  well-armed and collaborating with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decay of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by everyone about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
 we had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq  said the Sunni retired.
 I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down when I left 
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There is concern that a sudden influx of refugees will again increase sectarian tensions and bring the fighting back.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even stands out for the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
The Sarrois are in a deficit in one area only, which is similar to the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, out of self-deprecation, is displaying for its 50th anniversary.
In this respect, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system in the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Economic Institute in Cologne.
Thus, higher education institutions have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in 1948 by the French in Saarbrücken.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high percentage of foreign students, 15.6 per cent.
The Saarland also sends more than the average number of children to higher education - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In Saarland, the vocational training system is being used", says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their qualifications in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In terms of population, the dual-education panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has forced higher education institutions to launch a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we have seen a lot of reforms in the general schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced comparative tests throughout the state.
To help children start learning earlier, the last year of preschool is tax-free - a model that other states are now copying.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether pupil performance improves in a lasting way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students dropped from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And despite the odds, foreign language proficiency is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbour is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarros are not French.
Chávez is setting the clocks
In Venezuela, clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will turn the clock back half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As reported in the official Venezuelan newspaper, a new law will set clocks to four and a half hours off the international time.
This gives the South American country a time zone that no other state in the world has.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones into full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is pressing for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil-rich country will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spat in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez said on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is the talk of the town.
A new cell phone ring is making waves in the country: "Porqué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people on the internet.
It was spoken by the King of Spain, Juan Carlos, who at the most recent Ibero-American summit was angered by the constant questioning of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real wage decline is forecast to threaten German workers this year.
Experts have cited a variety of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a decrease in their actual payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The blame lies with low wage growth, higher value added tax and higher food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research, to the newspaper Bild.
New charges could also be incurred for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency is no longer entitled to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and fuel prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent year on year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its inhospitable atmosphere, Venus is more Earthlike than previously thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirlpools at the poles, similar to those seen on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have speculated that there are lightning on Venus.
The European probe Venus Express has now provided proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus is flashing from a height of about 35 miles [56 km] in cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous cypress theory, lightning would have brought life to Earth. The storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
"If life existed, it must have been very early in history", says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little life on the surface of Venus today. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures can reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it is still a twin", said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of the "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the search for Venus, since no spacecraft had been on its way to explore the planet since the 1990s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results now presented in several articles in Nature do more than just highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that our neighboring planet has more in common with Earth than was initially thought.
For example, researchers found that in addition to the winds already known at the North Pole, a clouds' whirlwind at the South Pole is spinning much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system is almost as massive as the earth and is almost as large, with a diameter of 12,000 miles [12,100 km].
The planet, called the evening or morning star, orbits the sun in just 225 days.
It does, however, rotate much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, bears little resemblance to Earth, scientists speculate that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been trapped on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the party feud over the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he was criticizing the SPD because of the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and is calling on the grand coalition to settle the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
"We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue", Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler was showing understanding for the Dalai Lama's reception by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid, even if I respect cultural differences", Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a delicate balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the criticism that she was organising a new China policy.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China knows that too", Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was attacked for it outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular of the CDU's "foreshortening policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, there was a furor in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel admit that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official capacity, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions seem to indicate that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan areas from China, which includes other provinces today.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to prevent social discontent in Germany from erupting into violence in the streets, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, burglars firing on police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosion does not develop in our own homes and turn violent.
We must take this seriously", he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federation, the Länder and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it is already showing its early successes".
But it would be too early to end the warning.
Schäuble also notes that in the German suburbs there are no problems sociologically or from the urban planning point of view as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in violent street fights with police in recent nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater efforts on the part of the German Government to integrate.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need for action.
Kolat emphasises that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration is higher than average.
The first thing to do is to provide more places for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that social control in families was more common in Germany than in France.
Many immigrant youths also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"But we must be careful", Kolat urged.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling of foodstuffs intended for human consumption
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, all was quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying overhead with spotlights.
The authorities at the station reported three arrests as well as a few cars and trash burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will continue to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the turmoil in Toulouse was overwhelming.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the prosecution's preliminary evidence, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopian entry of the Chancellor shows that the coalition is done with the bottom line - and that there is nothing more to be expected from her.
What country does this chancellor live in exactly?
After her dismal intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which were chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, after all, be governed by her.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
It has made it clear to Parliament that this is correct.
There was no real interest or feeling for the problems of the country.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, fleeing into foreign policy and even there remaining in the thick of it.
For example, climate protection: in this area, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused even two years ago.
Now it's clinging to ready-made formulas, that growth would touch people.
It destroys its image as a pragmatist, one who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and worries of low-wage workers?
He has a few extra sentences left for that.
The number of times it makes mistakes in this respect is telling when it comes to family allowances.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to say a half-precise sentence.
She's stumbling into uncharted territory from the moment it becomes concrete.
The branch attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two frontrunners Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tensions between the candidates are already high on the first issue.
He would have made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani responds with a sharp rebuke: "I would say that his own home was a haven for illegal immigrants", and blames the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur videos that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are little more than breathless.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we allowed Hitler to come to power", John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who was the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney too is being taught a lesson vigorously by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn waterboarding, a mock drowning interrogation method, as torture.
However, the fact that the campaign's important themes go beyond the Iraq war and the debate on torture is seen in the reactions in the St. Petersburg, Florida, Common Room.
Whether it's praising conservative values or rejecting future tax increases, applause is pouring into the auditorium.
Here again the weaknesses of the two favoured are revealed.
"I made a mistake back then", says Romney, repenting and apologizing to the base and the television audience for backing abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is in a bit of a bind when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf is reigning for the first time as a civilian.
A day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani power-man Musharraf was inaugurated as president.
Thus ended eight years of military rule.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to uphold the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless coup, the former general is now reigning as a civilian head of state for the first time.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf declared on November 3.
Soon after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, fulfilling another Western demand.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the imposition of the state of emergency with lawyers from his own ranks, had last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are back.
The German supergroups of the seventies play again: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, they released a recording of their hit "Live 1974".
Even then, they were much better known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen advertised on the evening poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and most importantly their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sitting in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked on the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, as the audience watches, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is bowing down on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it's accidentally added to a piece of traditional music.
It does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has secured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, while the name resonates in the collective memory of pop, it is by no means so enduring that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why should not the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is mistakenly called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in its country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the Cologne Can survivors for their work, the German pop faces were seen in the audience questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the eulogy, the amazement was boundless.
Later, during the shows, Michael Rother would jump on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is one and the same.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and that during this period the impact power felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played first in the basements under the Berlin stage.
Then to Düsseldorf, for a church-sponsored label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly played in Kraftwerk and eventually made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in a former Weser farmhouse, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a community fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
It's more of an artistic existence in the Spitzweg way.
Supposedly, in the trash was a flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next one was called "De Luxe".
Because as serene and low-key as the music sounded, the band was suffering from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood was not the only way to find oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" which has just been released was recorded at a concert in Griessem before a record audience of almost 50 people, as someone thinks he remembers.
Rother issued at this time a wish to force Harmonia to practice from time to time.
It was an immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric realms and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (Flaming Hearts).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since become more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We owe the album "Live" by Griessem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Her label Grönland set out to maintain Krautrock as the inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been excavated on this occasion as Roedelius' own work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Worldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British former punk and author of the paperback Krautrock Sampler.
There's also the inventor of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole range of Krautrock's influence would be circumscribed with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the band will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's line floats around the room amid the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white photos of wired tools in the bazaar serve to form the caption.
In front, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and drums, to make the instruments sound unheard of with the effects instruments that you build yourself.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
All three of them were great technical losers.
Even the house choir will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sound, and at a nice moment we sing "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in escaping artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The shouting "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not getting annoyed by it now either.
But what's most self-evident will be covered meticulously on stage.
Where does the music begin and end?
It can be a treat for someone's nerves (?) or it can be a momentary source of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killer Peace", two films again address the Balkan war.
But neither of them are convincing.
Either the plans are too much based on action and senseless exchanges of fire or they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help you.
The good news first: although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, it is precisely there, in the most gloomy backcountry of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the 1980s, because far too many gentle and trivial roles in women's-feeling films and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism had made him want to show off.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a beautiful, wink-filled portrayal: at bottom, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere might have become, had fate and the film industry not been so kind: a man whose best moments have long been behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument in decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this, "The Hunting Party" continues along with the German production "Killer Peace", which also releases this week, the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
"Murder Peace" can be quickly put on trial: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovo snipers, in whom one of them quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that for once the Serbs are not being portrayed as the sole cause of all the ills, this film, which is as flat as a TV movie, is lost far too quickly in the action and senseless gun battles.
It's still kind of a "Cobra 11 Alert" without the highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party" why there never was a really good film about the Balkan war.
The story of three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go into the forest in small teams, to accomplish something that the military can't, and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons "The Hunting Party" failed is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the desolate cynic with a heart, as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also credit him with a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, by a fast-track process, does what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him to exact just revenge on the Bosnian Muslims.
It's so bad that we should take it to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for violating cinematic logic.
In this case, the film has a too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this they must exceptionally agree) are not conducting the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the good-intentioned and the bad-intentioned are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It tells of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly that kind of tumbled heads, but they hint at how tiresome it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan wars.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were huge flops.
We can add that there have never been any good films about South Africa.
Which is always true: when a star hangs out in a crisis home or a minefield, he then comes out with something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, it was always decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie with "Schindler's List".
Some films have yet to mature - those that are now considered classics about Vietnam - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were by no means universally celebrated as masterpieces in their day.
But maybe we also know too much about the conflicts of the world today, where every massacre happens live on two screens at home at the same time,
And it robs screenwriters of the lack of scruples they need to tell good stories.
"To Be or Not to Be" or "The Dictator" actually became so good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin didn't yet know how dominating the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe we should have the sarcastic, distant artistic gaze of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and war will always be in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is getting criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with strong criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to keep fighting for the Water Games.
But von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chance.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a drop on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had so inspired the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measure".
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "taking as its starting point another amended agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday maintained his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that in the time frame we had planned until 2028 we will have no chance".
However, the dream is not definitely a thing of the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This would give the impression that Hamburg would not be bidding for the Olympics for another 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects now", HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and the Council for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympics in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in recent weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD faction of the mayor has criticized the Senate for not using this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction", said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook to be integrated into the Olympics and later use of the housing, the CDU is said to have relied exclusively on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have been a source of great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had been broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
If you connect the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, you think of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast a shadow over Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, internal research at Moderna Museet Stockholm has now led to a disappointing result: the six Brillo-Boxes, which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulten gave to Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - along with a large part of the hundreds of other Brillo-Boxes of the "Stockholm Type" that circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is a tangled web of artistic and curatorial production.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York City, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 featured - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather models of them, exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden crates produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time now speak of about fifteen wooden crates which at the time would have gone down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of these have been auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later sell to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén cases were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes in the museum, three others from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of the white oil paint.
The texture of the 1990 copies reveals that the paint was applied directly, without a backing, to the laminated panels using a roll of paint - and not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", suggests Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet. "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not reach a different decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material".
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in July that it would investigate the "heavy allegations" in the case of the soap boxes.
But since then, there's been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, the same rebel soldiers who had retreated to a hotel in Manila and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo are giving up.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he cannot be held responsible for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had just stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been trapped in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court Wednesday for a failed 2003 coup attempt - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to sneak out with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who were supposed to be watching them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Troops loyal to the government surrounded the area around the respectable hotel.
The President called an emergency meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People are sick of it", Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already the scene of the 2003 attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo.
The uprising broke down almost 24 hours later when the army refused to join in.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of over 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday.
Only 20.05% of the share capital would be held.
We've been talking about a buyout before.
The option to increase the stake in Versatel further would remain open.
The move is aimed at speeding up the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, speculation had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf grid operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money for only one third, the market says.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million of them for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", said a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, both companies want to feel satisfied with their 10 percent stake in Freenet, and not use their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies would however leave all options open, in particular to increase their stake in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still hard to predict Freenet poker game that has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million customers under a mobile phone contract at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding had until now a direct holding in Freenet of 6.01 per cent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring in about four percent more.
