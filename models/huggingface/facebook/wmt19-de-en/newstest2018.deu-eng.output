Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where excavations are now taking place for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small-scale gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals fascinating stories.
It sucks when maps are out of date.
Everyone knows that, who ever had to get upset, because the car sat nav instead of a bypass showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but for this very reason very informative.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of distribution of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called urposition sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Authority, these originated between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Their client: Napoleon.
The French army commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even if the French troops eventually withdrew with the Treaty of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the present-day neighbours who came up with the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founding the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between past and present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant revolt against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered parcels of land from the so-called "primordial recording," from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but by allotment gardeners in the "Land in Sonne" plant.
A large green area can be seen north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In what is now the district of Au-Haidhausen, not only the street name "am Gasteig" or the hill "Auf der Lüften" can be read in large letters, but also "Irren Anstalt."
Yes, people with delusions were once imprisoned here on Auerfeldstraße.
The Munich mental asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established there in 1858 / 59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institute - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time, for example, ending the chaining of the so-called lunatics.
He also forbade the staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has studied the institution for an exhibition.
At first there was room for 280 patients, later on it was extended to 500 places.
Eventually, even this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
On the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.
The TSV München Ost football ground is located to the west and residential buildings from the 1980s to the east.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally based on the original building of the lunatic asylum, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse."
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where preparatory work and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line will take place on 5 April 2017.
The slider lets you compare the old map of Munich with the aerial view of today - and fill in the hole at Marienhof.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to take effect August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred and are noted throughout the state," the group's statement said.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
'You've got civil rights violations that happen to people.
They get stopped because of the color of their skin, they get beaten up or killed, "Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
'We hear complaints with such frequency that we haven't heard them before. '
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for any state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely than whites to be stopped.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and let their families, friends and co-workers know what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
'People need to be prepared, whether it's bringing bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling across the state. '
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crimes reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in the country in the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, advocacy groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
Electric fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher pasture fence project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.
At the Schwendemann family's Rechtgrabenhof, representatives of Fischerbach's CDU local branch met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first gave an insight into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, looks after 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative-less marketing way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
As he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "fundamentally important."
I cannot operate profitably on such steep surfaces.
The grassland provides for a lot of work, much of it had to be processed with the Motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," emphasized Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over his parents "farm and managed it without chemical pesticides and fertilizer, even though he did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is pleased with the Leader funding."
Farmers would have to be supported at a cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this could delay the afforestation of the areas for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can further their business," said the mayor.
Farmers often come under criticism for subsidies
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in over the electric fence promotion.
This means that the open area is 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of 71,500 euros was funded by Leader, and a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers with €12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann said.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear: "The best food is produced here."
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg enables the state to support pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
Prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable by tractors (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
The application for the Fischerbacher Electric Fence Project 2018 is currently under way from eight participants with 24 plots who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.
The open space corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated costs amount to more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value them as much as anyone - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to slash legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done so.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller scolded Acosta, "I'm not going to go into a whole thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, yearning to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich shores."
There has never been a time when the "miserable waste" was more visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's America.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned for her words to be placed at the grassroots after her death - knew full well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical figurative representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great crier Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame to the reviled world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States. "
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Her torch is not intended to illuminate the way, but to kindle hatred, which is her only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scotland members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the Great Britain team
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn from it.
"We welcome it and we are trying to understand it and we will continue to do so until we find out," Black said.
'I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's got something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It's got something to do with what they've done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant. '
Several of Scotland's athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been named team captain.
'Eilidh's pretty humble.
Her captaincy speech was incredible, "Black said.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real emotion Eilidh brought to the event was great. "
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who is competing in her fifth World Championships in the 400m hurdles, said it was' incredible 'to see 16 Scots in the British team.
Scotland's best ever total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1,500m and 5,000m heats.
Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season which included victories at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but will also, in some cases, be competing in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me," she added.
'Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my captaincy speech?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to rely on that home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the critics, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "So what?."
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating among the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head on his page after chemotherapy.
Thus, blocking people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum designated as official, and employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people wielding the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she did ask about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post.
"I do not like this idea either, when a number of people take a stand on the same issue, some tend to disregard it as a so-called collective effort and not recognise it as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the governor's aides called a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message simply by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for berating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on the issue came last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment when she banned a voter from her Facebook page, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's day, the era of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers attacked his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that put down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he hasn't silenced them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are fundamental to our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links to the final last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built and we're seeing how it achieves its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
'The players will see this course at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry did a great job in defining this place.
He is an ardent supporter of the game and is proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course. "
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
'I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was withdrawn the year after I won it.
Coming back to that part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we'll always cherish. '
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
'You want to do well but you're also feeling that extra pressure.
I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played solid golf.
I'm happy with how it's gone so far. '
Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Fewer lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on the subject from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Connections to the house prove to be very complex
The construction works in Villinger Straße are in full swing and "are reasonably on time," according to Fred Heinze, head of the construction yard.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, as there is much hidden underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is enormous," Heinze says.
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water, "Marvin Kostorz says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a cooker.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers.
"No one dares walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by public hand before the occupying forces.
An existing pro-independence movement against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren, with a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a 5-hour morning car ride.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs, which have been transformed by rust into various shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and light-colored skirt.
"We used to only have leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything," says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which included accounts of atrocities from the previous year, including unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring in an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper than local Papuans in the traditional market," said Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
"It cost the indigenous Papuans - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to tackle inequalities and rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You said.
Indeed, just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai hit rock bottom.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with the butts of their rifles, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began throwing stones at police and military posts.
As the mood heated up, soldiers were sent an order over an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document obtained by TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, lots of shots were fired," he added.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told TIME in a somber mood.
'I saw he was dead... I kissed him, 'she said.
The Chief Inspector of Papua New Guinea Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" her station because she was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
'It's a matter of life and death. '
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
News of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address Papua's historic grievances.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights abuses.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that have to go through, "he said.
Then Wiranto backtracked when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," Yohanes says.
'I'm tired. '
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
'I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot. '
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid that there would be revenge," said Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being rushed to the hospital, according to TIME.
'I've been hiding in my house for two days. '
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribesmen who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years on the pretext of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty fuels dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potato each.
They keep the bulk of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between indigenous Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the more educated and affluent migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or skills needed to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign's promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not materialized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to cover Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is a free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, in addition to living under constant threat from a predatory military, have poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried on a site opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Fire hits Dubai's' Torch 'skyscraper for second time
A fire broke out in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 79-storey building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the tower block, which happens to be called the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "one resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at about 04: 00 local time (00: 00 GMT).
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding used for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed around 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Next best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal, revolutionary for the sport, to play Davis Cup singles only in two sets, was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-movement classics, which are often very long, but also much appreciated for this reason, will thus remain in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, which meant that the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the whole package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions, "Haggerty said.
They will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final at a neutral venue was not even put to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively small details: In future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce costs for the organisers, training pitch requirements etc. will be eased and players will have to attend fewer official media events before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items on planes, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Fewer than 1 percent said they had belatedly discovered that they had traveled in error with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to flout the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they had knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also admitted to intentionally bringing prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travellers across the country to find out how many had inadvertently brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that TSA policies are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electric jack-of-all-trades Elon Musk likes to boast about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
So far, he has concealed the fact that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphant figures for sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed another, less glamorous figure for the first time when announcing the latest quarterly results: that of the cancellations of the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had been touting the new car in recent months, with more than 500,000 pre-orders, and delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits that of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the 1,000 euros (1,000 US dollars in the US and 1,000 pounds in the UK) "reservation deposit."
There are currently 455,000 such noncommittal reservations, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could be a problem.
His argument: The challenge with ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models taken together - there are expected to be 500,000, and one million in 2020.
The demand for it is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations a day.
Those who order a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla succeeds in driving its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions and with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt it is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA Chief Pruitt Withdraws Over Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous job in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforces EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet implementation deadlines and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and reached an agreement to set the implementation date," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
'We don't believe in litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us. "
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt will at some point use his "belated authority and all other legally available authority" to ensure that the rules are "based on sound policy and the best information available."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone rules.
A bill approved last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to keep up the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - according to our lawsuits - is an important health and safety benefit for these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that is pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in this case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil-ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprise change of course.
"It's troubling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
'We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests. '
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, a serenade will be held in the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Due to its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have been the concern of Tumlingen's friends and supporters.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique village gem."
In 1267 the chapel of St. Hilary was mentioned for the first time in the Wuerttemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen including the bailiff's office" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
In addition to the former parish church, according to the text of the document, there was also a manorial courtyard on Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged, and not vice versa.
So there were people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the upper office of Freudenstadt from 1858, besides the lower village and the upper village, which are still barely recognizable in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the noble settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from early medieval canon law.
A gentleman who built, furnished and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
Linked to this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke up on Christmas Day 1673.
The newly purchased bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be surrendered later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years "War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery in Tumlingen also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of St. Hilary was demolished.
Only the steeple was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the steeple and half of it collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Pensionern" are taking care of the Hilarius plant as successors to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizer, the Friends and Sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth Serenade on Sunday, July 16, in the old cemetery of St. Hilary's Chapel.
It will be designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Town councillor Hartmut Romann will give the closing speech.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Doors open from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink will be served in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers emphasize the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to the care of their homeland, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines to be reviewed
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done unlawfully.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone in Viersen at the city border to Schwalmtal.
In principle, the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from becoming "sparsely populated."
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette through an amendment to the land use plan - but the Düsseldorf district government had not approved this because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of a prerequisite under planning law, the permit decision issued is still illegal and must therefore be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists."
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded by planning law."
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The Circle takes the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the proceedings being halted.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the district did not wish to comment on the content of the reasoning of the association "Boisheim resists."
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the City of Viersen has an indirect stake, signed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.
The construction of the four wind turbines is intended to cover the electricity requirements of around 11,400 households - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all households in Viersen.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in horrific crash
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The highway remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort on the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping possibilities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants for a shopping spree in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" -Weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is therefore planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their apprenticeships.
In addition, the shops in the city centre are to invite you to "midnight shopping."
The aim of the action is not only to inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags, which refer to the action weekend, so Christian king.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the "Attractive City Centre" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Fountain Festival, including an open-for-sale Sunday, discussions with all traders and landlords in order to encourage them to take an active part.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, new or re-opened customer potential is to be developed.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - including landlords, businesses throughout the city and associations.
It was important to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will be taking part in the third "Heimat-Shopping" day in Germany for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local commerce and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action under the auspices of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her immediate environment with his or her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
More people were injured.
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis has killed two people and injured nine others, some of them seriously.
According to the fire brigade, one injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A man who was initially missing was also later found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
Authorities suspected the cause of the accident was work on a gas pipeline.
Few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building during the holiday season.
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by The Washington Post.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly telling him: 'You can't tell the press that.'
Trump launched his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that a trade deal for the US to accept refugees who migrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "lousy" and "stupid" and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "Depp" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull 'this is the most uncomfortable call of the day'.
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists revive racist lynching as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Ga., and rumbled toward the Ford bridge in Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train by his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want that n ---- r Roger!" the man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22, is only a re-enactment.
But when a noose is thrown around "Roger's neck," almost everyone in the audience gives out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is truly incredible that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the re-enactment.
'It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls. '
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecutions, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
'We can't get healing and reconciliation until we get justice. '
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Though the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the double motive for the lynching has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed Georgia's black citizens to vote in the summer primary for the first time.
Around the same time as the election, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly over a woman, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they left the jail and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, which not only participated in the murders, destroyed evidence and covered up the identities of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community," If you register and vote, this will happen to you here. "
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her account is vivid, poignant, and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we're confronted with the ugliness of it in all of us," she said.
'But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through. '
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed review of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
'But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times. '
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play opens with Malcolm yelling at Hester and harassing him, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- er, disappear from my property!"
Rascona returns fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I being too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
'I just don't think white people said 'n --- er' back then. '
"Yes," quipped one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard" R. ""
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunshots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning gown, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many of them just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys "graves.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynching took place, the air feels spooky.
As the song's final notes fade, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children crouch by their heads, register the fake blood and still bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters, as if trying to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then breaks down in tears in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through for him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
'We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason. "
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted animatedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they had just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to describe the emotion the performance left behind.
'It's hard to hear those horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you, 'she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called a police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.
He said he had already started planning next year's performance.
"The re-enactment is in some ways inspiring because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
'It's like, if we don't learn from this, it can happen again.
If you don't study your own history, if you don't know your own history, you're doomed to repeat it. '
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf once again relies on a colourful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) alternatively shows a shabby street corner with remnants of the wall and kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open-top vintage Mercedes car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "Ring" production.
As in "Rheingold," the three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise wonderfully.
They saucily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and hand over the riot clique.
Stephen Milling sings the splendidly nasty Hagen, surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with loud applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows humbly and bends his hands to form a Merkel rhomboid, are celebrated wildly.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat, once again in casual casual casual clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team had been eagerly awaited.
While he had to endure a roaring pipe concert in 2013, there was great jubilation five years later, in which the sporadic "boos" went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been delighted.
"You can see that the audience has grown together with the" Ring "in a way," she had told dpa shortly before the performance.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding for his point of view had grown.
I take a positive view.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt at the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked in the open full day at the school.
What is your experience with this?
It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late-career volunteer.
How is that?
Quantity: I graduated from high school.
And then a degree in civil engineering, let's say, successfully dropped out.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Have a social year, there is an insight, there you can see what it is really like on the ground, perhaps in the focal point.
And was it?
Quantity: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Welfare Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteer work?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from a nursing home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partially in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from studying civil engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in your head who have a completely different story behind them.
Whether you are a refugee, a teenager who has been taken out of your family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you were not afraid of contact?
I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
Pearson, the British education group, said on Friday it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it embarks on another restructuring programme to cope with the pressures the company is facing.
The job cuts, announced by chief executive John Fallon for late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of his previous restructuring, which saw 4,000 job losses.
In a third cost-cutting programme, Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after posting a 1 per cent rise in first-half profits to £2.05bn.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest violence to hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by persons."
The statement said all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision late Wednesday to push ahead with so-called "Ozone 2015" regulations, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations - which measure pollutant emissions in one part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year, until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will boost economic growth.
But the effort has sparked a backlash from Democrats and conservation groups, who worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Local council wants communal space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the local council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area previously belonging to the congregation is owned by the congregation, there is now no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to help the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of floor space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have in mind that such a common area should not be provided as a meeting place only for the residents of senior-oriented housing, but should be open to the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was already pre-decided by the allocation of funds for the current budget last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The construction is located in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common room would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent of the funding.
In order to send a signal to the investor that he does not want to throw clubs between his legs in this respect, the draft resolution states that both the articulated roof - which is based on the surrounding buildings - and the convertible roof - which reduces the eaves height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: unanimously he passes the committee.
It is not so easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many buildings of her own with which one cannot really get along, but now one leans out of the window in the communal room, she says: "I have a hard time with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against communal participation.
It sees it as a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is simply not the case, because with the purchase of the area one does not give a subsidy, but gets a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, reads the counter-argument.
Staiger's motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly has three supporters.
Thus, the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we will be taking a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Cyclist is thrown onto road
An 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car while crossing the road in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been riding his bicycle on the cycle path of the road Schwarzer Weg coming from Hilden at 12.20 pm.
The senior wanted to cross the roadway at the level of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A female passenger car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When Langenfelder drove onto the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was hurled into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital by ambulance.
Bayern Munich will have to do without David Alaba and Thiago in their Super Cup clash against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup is without him: David Alaba has to miss the game against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory match of the new season with personnel concerns.
The defending Supercup champion is missing seven professionals against the Cup winner.
Personnel concerns at German champions Bayern Munich are growing ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (8.30pm on ZDF and Eurosport) with cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti will also have to do without David Alaba for the clash with Borussia Dortmund.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
Bayern Munich are also missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
Ancelotti has blamed his team's physical condition and lack of balance for the five defeats in their last six matches.
"We know we are not in the best physical shape," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important thing is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good in the end. '
But the 58-year-old believes his performance will improve in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show those qualities.
The squad is ready.
We want to play intelligently, "said Ancelotti, who expects a" difficult, intense game. "
The duel between the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the Harz Mountains
In the Harz Mountains, the first "Star Trail" in Germany is to be created.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many Harz visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to put up signs along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz Mountains.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be eligible.
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet.
Good mobile network reception therefore plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Starpath will be extended step by step.
"On the star path, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it is much further away.
It is also communicated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Frequently, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly visible to the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Göttingen Planetarium Association, there has been something similar to the planned star dwarf - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel on Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Trail with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stelae with the individual planets - including Pluto, which has been reduced to a dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth shrinks to a sphere 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia put out his right hand and said: 'How are you, champion?
I wish you the best of luck. "
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
'I'm a former featherweight, 'Garcia recalled.
'I went up for Broner [to 140lbs] but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that. '
Lomachenko agreed.
'Boxing needs this fight, 'he said.
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to set a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later openly expressing his desire to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... '
Garcia said he rates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and he may take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped short of lavishing praise on Garcia, saying he thought the three-time champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was on showing punch power, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the battle that must be fought.
No other fight attracts so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: 'I've been waiting for the top fighters and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight. '
Four injured after tyre burst
Four people were seriously injured in a crash on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the Marktbreit junction, probably after a burst tyre.
The car skidded to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
The A7 northbound was closed for about an hour while emergency services treated the injured. Afterwards, traffic could be diverted on the left lane past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "The chain of three works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2: 2 to the season opener against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue points brings.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result as well, had it not been for the two goals against Braunschweig in the 2: 2.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the chain of three is to be further optimised.
And the Fortune doesn't want to catch a goal after a free-kick.
"For the future, it will be the case that nobody will line up next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in the preparation, his team can cope better with the chain of three than with the chain of four.
"I do not yet know how we will operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players in the three-man chain at half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," Hoffmann said.
'The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and that we don't make too many mistakes in the build-up. '
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
'But whether you can talk about a bad start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be okay, "Hoffmann said.
'But if we can come away with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, I'm sure we'll have a decent start to the season. '
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I will only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons "match in Heidenheim had to be called off prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can basically start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favourite in their bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are at the moment," says the Fortuna central defender.
The guests from the Rhineland will go into Sunday's match in the (nearly) finished stadium of Aue as slight favourites.
"It is nonsense that we sweep them away just because we have the ambition to finish in the top six," says Funkel, whose record with only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the second division that you have to beat from the start," Fortuna's head coach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And that is not how he wants his players to feel on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the people tested are older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they are to make the assessment of age more precise, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest the person being examined is 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that he would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the Karolinska Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he told Metro newspaper.
But Göransson, from the Forensic Medicine Agency, defended the accuracy of the tests, saying: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child incorrectly as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case it's about 10 per cent. '
Full on plan
Work on the three bridges of Highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very well on time, things are going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Traffic in the Regional Council of Freiburg.
Work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation in April.
Construction is due to finish in October and we are confident that the timetable will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arched bridge made of concrete covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has grown old.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve metres long and 10.60 metres long respectively.
On Wednesday morning, the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach received a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-tonne bridge cap on its north side.
This is an edge attachment, which is also used as an operating route.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
The pedestrian path will then run along it.
The special thing about it is that it concerns finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach required special sensitivity.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
Residents were informed about the project by leaflets in advance of the works.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge near the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach.
The total cost of the three bridge refurbishments is EUR 700,000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colourful protest at German potato salad
It is not often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what would otherwise be difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance, which peacefully flies the flag on this day, because the AfD invites people to the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell for what the poster calls a "big campaign launch."
And well-known names will be at the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD members, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "Everyone at a table" on Brunnenplatz, but now takes place on the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
It's a colourful picture.
And Christa Karoli, president of Forum One World and one of the main organizers, is really pleased: "It's great how many people have come together here."
There is music and plenty of food, including "an ancient German potato salad that even the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it with her.
The police have summoned many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the railway station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD said he had tried to organise such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially enquired in Daun, but was refused because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the Laurentiuskirmes that had already been set up.
So now the roundel, Hompes is glad that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
Commenting on the event on the roundabout forecourt, he said: "This is the right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful."
And it does: around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the roundabout forecourt, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including Uwe Junge, leader of the AfD in Rhineland-Palatinate.
There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for Alice Weidel, the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, and Beatrix von Storch, the vice-president of the Federal Republic of Germany, to give their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour lasts the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is shortly after 21 Clock tidy up announced.
The police can move away - no special occurrences.
Trombone meets trumpet
There will be a reunion with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli in the Haslach monastery concerts series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest," or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is principal trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is principal trombonist with the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both share the desire not only to transcend the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach can be heard in both of them as if in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating Gesamtkunstwerk.
This centrepiece of the programme was premiered only this spring in Freiburg with enormous success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: the Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything, "Kristen Stewart said candidly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think," Oh that was cool, what's next? ""
Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, which ultimately fell apart bitterly.
Despite this, the brunette actress told Harper's Bazaar magazine: 'I was genuinely in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it? "
After their split, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: 'I've always lived the dualism and genuinely believed in it.
So it has never baffled or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously. "
According to "Bang Showbiz," however, she suffered most from this during her school days, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
It really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the children told me I looked like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think: "Girl, be proud of yourself." "
She doesn't like to explain her love life to the public in particular: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public. '
West Virginia Governor Announces He's Changing Party
Democratic West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would switch parties.
Like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me, "Governor Justice said.
'Today I'm going to tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of reflection... today I'm going to tell you as a West Virginia resident I can't help you anymore when I'm a Democratic governor. '
The rally erupted in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
'As a coach, I'd say it's time to play a different game. '
Mr. Trump earlier promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
He is worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hinder than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is top-to-bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises' honest 'Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as a blatant apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but reiterated it was not the time for the country to return to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all the athletes who have had their gold and silver medals snatched away in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to separate clean athletes from the tainted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players under the strict IAAF criteria at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.
Funeral for soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1,000 people paid tribute to the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
But she described the two pilots who died as "experts in their field."
"We bow before this supreme sacrifice that they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse were killed in Mali, West Africa, a week ago on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transported to Germany and on Thursday, accompanied by a funeral vigil of the Bundeswehr, they were brought to the Cathedral of St. Peter in Fritzl.
At midday, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral service began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politicians.
Among them were the Prime Minister of Hessen Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid roses and relatives stood arm in arm by the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers who died as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The chief of staff helped to build up the flying operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen showed no doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
The Bundeswehr did not specify when or where they will be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family announced the news on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement added.
It is not yet clear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
But he had no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made any secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession to the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016 and also holds the title of "Prince Consort."
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
It is not yet clear where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, Margrethe had met in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy on the River Thames.
While his later wife always received the sympathies of the people, Prince Henrik had a hard time in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of his first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco, who had a reputation in this country for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes! "
Prime Minister Weil wants early elections
CDU and FDP facing possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick new election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil called for parliament to be dissolved on Friday.
Earlier, the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not being nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hanover on Friday.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them.
Together, the CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new state parliament will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil considers it indispensable, however, that the state parliament decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on its next course of action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament removes the Prime Minister's confidence and elects a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be properly examined in legal terms, "said Thümler.
"All issues will be discussed calmly when they have been examined in a legally reasonable manner."
Thümler called Twesten's move "a bit odd."
The politician herself insisted: "I am not a traitor.
I'm feeling very good. '
She described herself as a follower of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MP to return her parliamentary mandate.
"We naturally assume that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she received via the Green Land List, with immediate effect," announced the chairmen of the Länder Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The leader of the Green Party Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She had made a conscious decision not to have a debate within the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD candidate for chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the conversion of Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green Party," the leader of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the state parliament re-elected quickly.
Leaving the EU will cost the Tories a majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician put "in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputies that Elke Twesten join the CDU.
The parliamentary group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a wafer-thin one-vote majority in the state parliament.
Interview with Agriculture Minister - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers questions in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the egg batches concerned.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, as far as we know at present, there is virtually no risk to health.
Is Aldi now adopting the best possible crisis response - taking all eggs out of the supply - because the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really taking on the central role of enlightenment?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House intervened immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the Länder ever since the news of Germany's concern became known.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
Retailers, like manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg / kg, they are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, it is not the farms that are to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
As far as we know, there is no direct culpability on the part of the production companies.
On the contrary, they face economic damage as a result of alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
After all, it was the official controls that uncovered the affair.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent ruled out.
Precisely for this reason, a consistent investigation of such events and handing them over to the public prosecutor's office in cases where criminal offences may be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a full explanation.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
Consumers are right to be outraged when an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry.
The adulterated agent has put manufacturers, distributors and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and without gaps.
How football's financial rules are affecting Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European football clubs, will not interfere with Neymar's world-record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint Germain in France.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will still come from UEFA, because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary in the region of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money to sign Neymar and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players, but they have to counteract this with legitimate revenue streams that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs "debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - was to become a harder business.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of €30m.
And although Platini fell from grace as president in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's head of FFP, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause as a lump sum, they can spread the amount over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, meaning the transfer fee for the next five years of €44.4m will be included in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014-15 Champions League season be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outwit its financial regulator by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship had been inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean UEFA will be even more vigilant to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, said people familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent published reports show PSG made a profit of more than €10m in 2015 / 16 on revenues of €542.4m.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent after the signing.
The Spanish league were clearly irritated to see one of football's best players leave and tried to block Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate FFP.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS, referring to Qatar's eventual ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go down different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country. "
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet collaboration is about to come to an end: The airline is re-tendering the contract.
At the request of the news agency sda, Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-and-white chocolate bars of 14 grams are distributed to passengers each year by the flight attendants before landing.
Swiss declined to give details about the costs.
According to "Northwest Switzerland," industry insiders estimate the order volume to be between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs.
But what is more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious contract.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there will be in the new competition.
However, only Swiss manufacturers can be considered.
According to the newspaper report, Frey plans to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
Sda, Switzerland's largest chocolate maker, could not be reached for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers will be pampered with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers will snack on Shoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class on Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey will also be distributed on short-haul flights, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Olympic discus champion Robert Harting reaches World Championship final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in Saturday's final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed to qualify for the national championships and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres, also qualified for the final with his first attempt.
Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This rerun of history is simultaneously nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the 1980s, for the grunge era of the 1990s (when masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd, went to greater things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny kids who grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its grown-ups now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more watered-down, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazily malicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the digressions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's "Singles" lip-beard, whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like some kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume is its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," the final scene of which will show the gang attending the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now evokes a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW," with its East-versus-West wrestling iconography.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, this comedy, directed by Rhys Thomas, claims to be a found TV series: an eighties Romanian drama with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent 'find the voice' game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - involving a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like one.
Six long episodes drag on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which has been edited to a lesser length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a pile of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make anything fodder for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and theirs.
Blow to the country's drug mafia
The police have dealt a blow to the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, the prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen suspects, aged between 25 and 77, were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued for them.
Officers also seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people have been arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued for the two suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the operation.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
The prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany since the summer of 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil police station had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
That is why four officials from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning.
The investigation focused on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to be attributed to the gang.
Weise complains of large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data of citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This sometimes leads to serious miscarriages of justice in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis published in the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."
According to the figures, the register covers ten million people with foreign nationality, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
According to this, the data is administered by around 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts until now.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have long since ceased to be alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Incorrect data entry can significantly slow return processes," the report says.
In addition, the statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country include EU citizens who do not have to leave the country at all.
Such misallocations, however, "led to a distorted debate about how to deal with those who are obliged to leave," the analysis said.
Meanwhile, the German government appears to have begun to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they have entered from there.
This is apparent from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung."
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and very young children - in Italy since 1 June 2017."
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
In justifying the decision, the Office wrote: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these assurances sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The home affairs spokeswoman of the Left faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised the decision: "Families with children are threatened with human rights violations and endangering the welfare of children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system."
Second-best result
The blood donation service has already made a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who received the award on Friday.
First and foremost Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality acknowledges in the meeting of the municipal council the multiple readiness to donate blood.
"It is awesome how our bodies are designed for this and we pay our respects to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even more so selflessly," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, Head of the German Red Cross (DRK), as the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC's head of preparedness.
Apparently, the change to the theater a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger recorded half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave off 500 millilitres of their lifeblood ten times.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowing inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on family incomes amid mounting pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that rate rises would be needed in the coming years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the Funding for Lending Scheme to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it said it now expected to provide £15bn more under the scheme - £115bn more.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: 'In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption.'
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and "somewhat more" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The downward revision to the Bank's growth forecasts for this year and next compares to the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and fell 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for an interest rate hike, with GDP rising to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be around 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to pick up slightly towards the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and small wage increases, because the tightening will get worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a fall in incomes in the coming years, but added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also being boosted by rising demand for British goods, driven by the weak pound, which will offset some of the fall in consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to fully recover.
Before the Bank's latest interest rate decision, calls for a rate rise had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and would pick up in the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: 'Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders clamour for deals and want to end the year on a positive note.
The market is looking particularly good for those with existing deals coming to an end and taking out new mortgages, with many offering fee-free options and low rates. "
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a High Court battle over funding for the drug on the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the NHS through an initial three-year trial for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, with more clinics to follow in October before it is rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means there are just enough drugs in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also register to attend their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "
Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to transform Britain's HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be for the trial to be carried out quickly across the country and for no one at risk of HIV to be left behind.
Now that PrEP has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people living with HIV. "
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and long overdue after months of delay and delay by the Government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out across the country as quickly as possible to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society. "
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for property, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell them.
"Before that, I lived in a much bigger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and I made an offer that day. "
Since the first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely refurbished.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement, "she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's Notting Hill architecture and design studio, Duck & Shed, to use the 12.5-foot ceilings to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but of arranging the steel in such a way that it was the right height for the function above or below. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other at full height - with plenty of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic retro copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the tone for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it last longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen when not in use.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special feature of this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
'It's counterbalanced so when you push the door up it slides very easily. '
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the land - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
'In a rudimentary form, an estate agent will come in and do a calculation based on the land size, 'he says.
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
'You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart. '
It shows that an apartment can transform from something standard to something amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave them.
Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are locked in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to seek clarification on how their property and business assets will be divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a bitter battle over the split is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate and De Lutis "portfolio now includes city centre offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and suburban shopping centres.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court document states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul is worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved a problem for Paul.
'Colin's proposed splits have left him with what I thought were the best properties, 'he wrote in an initial affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - something Colin claims Paul has ruled him out of.
Colin argues this is not true and accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the number one priority," he wrote.
Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and bipartisan law firms.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, have become "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL executive and being the TV star's best friend, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father didn't want Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he identified a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he got good information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from outlets that needed convincing," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption is a constant source of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his team-mates have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times already, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties, people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that might advance their views of the world.
Politico - preoccupied with this story - reported in May on the advisers' penchant for leaking dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is fixated on figuring out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the Web site of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for harassment, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has made false allegations in the past and retracted them.
Trump read the article and started questioning staff about Walsh. ""
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House press secretary Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly tried to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are by nature not known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday the operation, which follows the EU Most Wanted Advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
Thirty-six of those wanted online have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of information posted on the website.
Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to 'millionaire's row'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are at war again with some determined travellers who have negotiated a council-drawn trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travellers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the "Millionaire's Row."
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after being thrown out in May, but have not been deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a way.
Furious residents have slammed Solihull Council, which said it was' useless to deal with the problem '.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today. "
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop it. '
One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers only to be robbed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the park. '
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside off Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police and taking the necessary legal action to ensure they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court will have to consider when we present our case. "
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house on the outskirts of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost, as well as income from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the district administration as a collective accommodation, which caused controversy.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the local council at the time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with CEO Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
Construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance to the former Hotel Birkenhof for some time now, and when you enter the building, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do between now and March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything was to become "nicely citizen-oriented," as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, emphasizes Scherer.
Scherer goes on to explain that the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to be broadly positioned.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He has already held talks with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city coincide with those of the hotel group.
'We're on the same page. '
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be precise.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought up to date, this is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be created in a courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russia affair: US special counsel appoints grand jury
Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a grand jury in the Russia affair involving US President Donald Trump, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the move as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that the panel has already issued preliminary subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow.
The investigation is said to focus on several men who worked as advisers to the Republican during the campaign.
Mueller has also reportedly been increasingly scrutinizing Trump's private and business life.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel had personally put Trump at the center of an investigation into whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to review the available evidence in possible felony cases and to decide whether charges should be brought.
Grand juries are therefore also called impeachment chambers.
Usually they are turned on when there are larger and more controversial cases.
The proceedings are always conducted behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called in by prosecutors to subpoena people for questioning under oath.
Subpoenas have already been issued relating to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, according to CNN.
Individuals involved in the meeting were invited to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday night that the appointment showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he would act quickly if necessary.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that the grand jury will ultimately be involved in deciding whether to indict.
Still, the panel's appointment is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump, he said.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
'The Russia story is a total fabrication, 'Trump said.
He said the issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he was unaware of the appointment of a grand jury.
But it usually works in secret, he said.
The White House supports any action that would "fairly" speed up the special counsel's work.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation.
There was no reason to believe anything had changed, the statement added.
Mueller was only appointed after Trump fired Comey.
The firing prompted accusations against Trump that he was trying to obstruct justice.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under intense pressure over the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House gathered material against the special counsel and his staff.
That prompted speculation about whether Trump would fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel, as in the Watergate affair involving President Richard Nixon, who later resigned, Mueller has a position in which, in theory, he could be fired by the Justice Department at the president's insistence.
Several senators from both parties, however, want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills Thursday that would make it harder for the special counsel to be fired.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floats in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg nearly seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over one trillion tons and measures 5800 square kilometres, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
He does not pose a danger to people.
The extent to which climate change played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact sheet.
Many researchers believe this could be linked to global warming.
The colossus that has now broken off was previously part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
Ice shelves float on the sea and are fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also at risk, as the front edge has never retreated as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels, because they float on water and ice displaces as much water as it results from the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, according to the British Antarctic Observation Project (Midas).
The Larsen C ice shelf is the fourth largest in Antarctica, covering almost 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he said.
Scientists are debating whether the Larsen C ice shelf will grow again or shrink over the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a large number of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long strip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice cover has shrunk by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature had contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees Celsius over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house price rises for staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for withdrawal from the employers "association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the county council waved through 41 new jobs in administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first day at work.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously much sought after.
Approximately 620 applications were registered for the places to be allocated this year.
Nevertheless, the district still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
Among others, doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration are being sought.
The CDU would like to seize the initiative in the district congress together with the FDP and the UWG and counteract the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wish of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."
The aim is not only to meet short-term demand for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should orient itself inwards and outwards, point out concrete measures for lateral entrants and contain a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the county is dealing with personnel problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.
There is talk of a veritable "competition between public employers."
In addition, a large number of employees are retiring due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time for action to ensure that more vacancies are not left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, and his party go even further than the joint motion.
He caused a stir in the Commons recently when he publicly questioned the cap on staffing costs, baffling the other parties.
Völker wants all options to be explored for leaving the local employers' association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should work with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the municipalities belonging to the district - towards an in-house tariff," says Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than is actually envisaged by the collective bargaining agreement for the public service.
Salaries are currently strictly prescribed, but increases or more money can only be obtained if you move to a higher level based on years spent in the profession.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they abide by new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minetti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a boat belonging to German aid group Jugend Rettet because its crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in ways that facilitated illegal immigration.
The charity, which has only been operating for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"Saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
'We can't assess all the allegations that are currently being made until we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation. '
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew are taking on board dinghy migrants who are being delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to depart so that the boats can be used again.
At least one such encounter reportedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "significant changes or impediments" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations had dropped sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Viewing points followed, some on towers, from which one could see far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the salt pans and the sausage market.
Again, viewpoint after viewpoint was lined up, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many vertical meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhalatory.
Neustadt was also headed for.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude difference, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - both in sporting and cultural terms.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga gears up for e-sport
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of fighting their way through sweat in wind and weather on the stadium turf?
The fact is that e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "a lot of clubs will jump on this bandwagon."
Next weekend, the world football federation FIFA is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, so that young people can still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online in these markets far more often than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is at stake?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought out on a competitive level.
For a long time now, as in normal sport, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And e-sports are already part of the official program for the 2022 Asian Games.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly takes getting used to.
Ingo Froböse also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
Cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding, and a rapid reaction capability are also needed.
Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
'The fit player is a good player, 'he said.
But Froome also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue."
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players travel internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were generated in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion Euros of the Bundesliga, that is not much.
However, e-sports are "not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries have moved on.
Major markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in eSports betting company Unikrn.
Something is happening in Europe, too.
E-sport has been introduced as a subject in a Norwegian school, Froböse says.
According to Dutt, Premier League football clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"Germany lags behind in European comparison," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Nostalgia alone, and glorifying the old days, is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," says Dutt.
'You can't hold on to the fact that in football everything stays the same as it always has been. '
Gift eggs - the egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poisonous eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted by withdrawing all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven not to contain fipronil should be put on the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide in the death of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing: 'My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, hands folded and eyes down as she was sentenced.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility, "she said.
hasn't shown any remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance, which she totally regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is not a day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity, "it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
'Not having this single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always carry with me for the rest of my life, 'she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered that she should benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, told the Los Angeles Times: 'Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail.'
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from Bayern's new mini Lahm
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the side at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern are confident that the Confed Cup winner will have a great season - there is no harm in extra motivation.
Something was different in his place in the dressing room, Joshua Kimmich saw that straight away, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since there was of course no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, he kept the bandage on his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner said afterwards, after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the first leg could have been better than the 0-2 against Napoli.
But the sign from the coach could also be interpreted as Kimmich.
It was not Arturo Vidal, who was eight years older, who was chosen as the player leader in the C-team consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just returned from holiday, but him.
After all, one prefers to distribute sugar to those whom one trusts a lot, whom one wants to keep happy.
So whoever has been chosen to inherit Lahm can only need a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: 'That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility.'
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old dashed across the field as a mini Lahm.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on his arm did the rest.
And Kimmich, in that starting line-up, looked like the man who can take the lead the best.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unrehearsed troupe.
He had an eye for the big picture, while many others were occupied with themselves.
Vidal trying to cover up his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches trying to build on the performances of the trip to Asia (only worked to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle trying not to attract negative attention in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
At least it worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich and Rudy in front of the defence, both acting with aplomb.
The well-known Napoli Storm often struggled, and Süle also tried a few times successfully in the build-up to the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not what we hoped it would be."
But he, too, put in a decent performance on debut.
Shifting the game, changing the tempo: "I was brought in for that style, too."
After the match, you could see how unusual this Bayern world is for the new arrivals.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said his goodbyes to his new team-mates after making a couple of crisp saves.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game. "
At least he doesn't have to teach the newcomers any more.
Alaba motivates Austria women's team
David Alaba believes in the success of our women's team
Austria's best-known footballer took to Twitter shortly before the match to wish the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fevered with our ladies.
The tweet from the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner was meant to be a special injection of motivation.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavarian dusel, too.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's speed
The relationship between the state and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green Party) was Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is apparent after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy when asked - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of industry, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the closing of the gap on the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
Later this year, the ministry hopes for a planning approval process, with the building code to be in place by 2021.
The Trier West Bypass, which is in urgent need of the Federal Transport Route Plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to open the line in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is striving for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine, as suggested by Wissing, in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of declining German wine exports over the past ten years.
Besides Wissing has an open ear for humans, who want to found their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
Planned is a premium of 1000 euro for the passed master examination and 2500 euro, if graduates within ten years after the master training make themselves independent.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts are to be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive of the Trier Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing intends to recruit at the Landesbetrieb Mobilität, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The Chamber of Commerce calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, vice-president of the CDU, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that in 2017 and 2018 the state is investing more than 20 million euros less in maintaining state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects the country to come up with a concept of how it wants to remedy the skills shortage in the region.
He also said the roll-out of broadband in the country so far was sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply with the grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained of stalled Internet connections and cancellations.
Ex-Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it had already left the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Automakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers of installing equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of cosying up to powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which banned the use of so-called defeat devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but scaled back under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been indicted in the United States, while others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was implicated in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profits.
This message was sent to the raft on the Isar on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
Tomorrow, Saturday, a raft will sail through Munich, which has a special message, so that visitors to the Isar can join in.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge.
And this is no ordinary raft, with tourists from the Isar.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
A large infotransparent can be seen on the raft.
It shows a pile of garbage.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to visitors to the Isar.
With the motto "True love is...," the understanding of the Isar River as a wild river worthy of protection is to be sharpened.
Already last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoonists, and the bulbous noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there's too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on 4 August 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he worked his way through, among other things, as an artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
After stints in Lima, New York and Paris, his breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded figures of Mordillo cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
By his own account, he still sits at the drawing table in the early hours of the morning, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, soft toys and clocks, his funny figures continue to find widespread worldwide.
He has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters for the past six years.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favorite animal in his drawings - who has a millipede as his opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is set to hit the big screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," Mordillo said.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life span of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf leeches, and in very dry weather there are a lot of them. "
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened ones.
So we have less essential oil parts. "
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhoen is celebrating its 1200-year anniversary this year.
The festival culminates this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Shopkeepers, guilds, merchants, vagrants or a slave camp are to be experienced on these days in the city center.
The killing of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: taking their children into the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no lull from the violence, and while bodies are piling up all over the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, even though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez with his middle finger emblazoned with the word "Justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his trademark Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists "cases, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists "killers are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and the terrain is even more treacherous now.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
'As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone. '
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which translates as "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely around Culiacan.
But on the Valdez issue, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions here fight to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that every day in Sinaloa one or more people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug lords that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state, with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First came the release in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
The publication may have angered the sons, with suspected gang members buying up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without coming across the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
'You've got to do the job that you do as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked: "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a docker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions, and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees met for security training. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the 104-degree (40-degree) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-joking, some of the reporters wondered if those officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountainous area where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had an exposé on state spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite haunt of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for most of the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the eatery, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender physique.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adams disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
That day, Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked for it to be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" last year attributed more than half of attacks on journalists to police and civil servants.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others carry on as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as seems to be the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the pavement in front of the office, drinking beer, when all of a sudden their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the kerb, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens blared nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers who were on guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out into the street for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to evade his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have discovered that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even see that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "troubled past."
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers, who describe it as' truly remarkable'
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk as he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal inside the 2,500 pound (1,100kg) lump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink your eyes a little bit, you could almost believe it was asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered in armour and resembles a walking armour, it was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature's top was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored concealing confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use countershading - think deer, zebras, or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was facing a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was driven out to sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint your eyes a little, you might almost think he's sleeping. "
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, crisscrossed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
They include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from muzzle to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes that protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armored herbivore washed up across western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are splayed upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole. '
In the storm: Mass brawl on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass brawl.
There are numerous casualties, miles of traffic jams - and gawkers.
About 20 people were injured in a mass brawl on the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, around 5 p.m., almost 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, had crashed into each other during a thunderstorm between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (district of Aichach-Friedberg).
The exact number of casualties was not immediately available.
The injuries were minor to moderate, a police spokesman said.
A large contingent of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
Driving in the direction of Munich, a backlog of around ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstructions on the oncoming carriageway - by numerous gawkers.
The fire brigade noted down the number plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with severe penalties.
Shortly after 18: 45 there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There had been a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: You sit on the train and sleep unsuspecting.
Or you are engrossed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the conductor comes and rudely wakes you up or pulls the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket inspection.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing creator-less ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus validate the ticket.
There is currently a test operation on two lines.
"When the offer arrives, we expand it.
It is then expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year, "said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is what the train calls ticket cancellation without a conductor.
However, in order to be able to use them, a number of prerequisites have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You must also have bought it via the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
This is how the "comfort check-in" works: you board the train and call up your ticket under "My Tickets."
The test customers will then see a button for electronic validation.
The conductors receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the conductor arrives at seat Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been validated.
So you can sleep on, keep working, keep quiet.
"Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to personalise their travel time on the train, "says Michael Peterson, Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Anyone who often travels by train knows that, apart from delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documentation you need for the validation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.
As a result, there are endless discussions between the conductor and the passenger, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or in the wider area and delays in checking your own ticket, ultimately taking the conductor's time to deal with other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still lying on the street," it said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was sprawled out in the street and would remain there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer pulled out his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled her saying.
'It's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and we can call typical. '
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and I was crying. "
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters March 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled saying.
'We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them, "Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It needs to be well developed, to know not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free, to liberate ourselves.
Even though I am lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice by keeping her out of it. '
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place across from the police department that became a camp area as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter bonded with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come together. '
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story you can exploit?"
That skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, and along with six other locals, the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us, we talk," Davis said.
'That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed. '
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - but she turned out to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, including how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
'But I've understood that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people. '
Ferrell's story also echoes the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and that's why we're constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of it all. "
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being upheld by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," with Ferrell chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
'It's no coincidence that she was on the front lines because there's so much at stake in living at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen. "
Now the news cameras are long gone in Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to singing, and she's been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "
From "Dream" to "Megalomania": TV Readers Discuss Bit Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian precinct has divided the population into proponents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves anyone cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."
While some say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), others say: "Does no one need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents are banking on a gallery attracting more customers to the city, which will benefit the rest of the stores, opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will bleed to death.
In addition, the gallery is being planned on the very site where the farmers "market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers sell their products.
This will be the end of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely towards Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the farmers" market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much like.
We also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities it is the same.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting. "
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But this is not likely to be very low with the new project. "
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are, on top of that, reasonably priced.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
Too bad there are almost no specialty shops anymore and what is left of them will probably disappear. "
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers "market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost of Bit-Galerie manage to drive all the businesses out of Bitburg before? "
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmers "market rather than this gallery.
But there is no more room for a farmers market hall in Bitburg thanks to the insanely many - in my opinion - senseless construction projects.
If the farmers "market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black, and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging from cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek dabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clips from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he was just three days into office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, from which 30 portraits of what someone with these genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly uncomfortable in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - to which she has been associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you got in touch with Chelsea and asked if she wanted a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became disparate pen friends, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic, "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would overturn Chelsea's ruling and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome sort of happy coincidence.
There is something deep and powerful about the opening of the exhibition, too, as Donald Trump wades into a war against government whistleblowers and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to heal.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the gallery wall, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture" with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname has a heart).
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon) would show how astonishingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
'DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories. '
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
It shows Manning emerging from the United States military barracks like King Kong with a hands-free phone in hand.
"If they cold-call your speech, they won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote me," said the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
'I still get goosebumps when I'm talking about it. '
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated presciently in the comic book - but if she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra that cluster like hordes of protesters.
This was purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, down to size (5 "2, Manning's stature), where her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation, 'he said.
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was fatally stabbed in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after suffering multiple stab wounds.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem had now been placed on leave and barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and are ready to assist US investigators in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to surrender.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have an idea of her whereabouts and our efforts to locate her are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents saying: 'Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.'
"We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
'At a certain stage of meeting the criteria set out in the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping), 'he said.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard, 'Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
Mutko says there is nothing in it that could be of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
On the matter, Mutko said: 'We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist. '
Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: 'We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she has been allowed to plan and co-ordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi to stop selling eggs for now
This was announced by the business groups.
It was a purely precautionary measure and no further damage to health could be assumed, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs that have been proven to have tested negative for fipronil containing anti-lice agent will be allowed to be supplied to Aldi.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness among her employees at her e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or, worse, fraudulent.
And even though she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There's just never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She has been calling people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-Suite executives and address the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what her employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval ratings - so you can drill down why.
Companies are coming to realize that staying at the top of the workplace culture is essential lest you become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke out were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send bespoke "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has caught up with the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the old days, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays general counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue employee complaints.
Now that the company is deploying Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
'And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation. '
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations stemming from the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media came into its own" that companies realised they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has the backing of venture capital investors who have backed both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of business, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices are heard, and that the work they do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well. Companies do well when employees are committed and committed.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you find support.
Data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, you're going to ask yourself," Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I? '
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem was reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication enabled her to reorganize several teams within the company and add communications training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'And when you lose people, you lose customers, too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's approaching 11 p.m., as a crowd of UCLA football players converses on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and are showing their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, those idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour drill, before returning to Wasserman Football Center at 6: 30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated two-day practices to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until Friday's final.
That's why UCLA's first three practices were scheduled to begin at 7: 15 p.m. to accommodate the players' already jam-packed schedules.
The trade-off away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and practiced during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 drills over the course of August, 20 before formal game preparations begin for their opener against Texas A & M on Sept.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy itineraries.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
'And they've just pushed it through, they keep pushing themselves, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great. '
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will be no easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs clearing a safety net behind a goal post.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once those rooms are vacant during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
'It's a real problem and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then preparing to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security guards there, and we have security guards in the parking lot.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We've got a plan. '
Facebook to step up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results below the original post, the world's largest online social network said Thursday, as part of its effort to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers who may see results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings, as they did before September's election.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking system would be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, Facebook News Product Manager, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Making a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In its more recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy home in the Bewl River valley in Kent, and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England 'spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story has been illustrated by a different emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes's first book to be based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I was just reacting to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
'That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.
Oh, I love archives! "
For someone so battered by old papers that he is backed by the National Trust and Arts Council England and has lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overrated my welcome a little bit"), all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, talking to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he "drank whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was not given full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were only just beginning to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying" Oh, throw it into the attic. "
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree that two families fought for.
Guys, let it all go his way! "
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve deeper into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants "Revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380 in this book called 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected? "
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which portrays the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed quite crooks, getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys with a talent for wooing heirs. "
After completing his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau von Donnerstag).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
'It's too good for us.
Or?, "ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think so (of course!)," they write on their website, which was launched yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as citizens of Bad Honnefer we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city. "
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is important to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can afford a medium five-figure sum for its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) deliberates in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So it has been this week.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine for Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister's official residence.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions.
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is taking the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army, mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people directly involved in the coup attempt have been on trial in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "gift from God," saying it would give him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort at Military Headquarters."
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale cleanup of the army and security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree firing another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
Yet Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military.
The generals were once regarded as the real masters of the country.
Three times they staged a coup, citing their role as guardians of the secular order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least by invoking the European Union's reform agenda.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an unnamed officer, who sought asylum abroad for fear of persecution after the coup attempt, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO indifferent.
In any case, there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army after the purges.
Leadership and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It proposes to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are being proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is expected to be debated in both chambers of Congress.
'This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens from other countries. '
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves, and who demonstrate skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry to renovate track for racetrack shuttle
Over the past few months, there had been repeated disputes about the future of the racetrack shuttle - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction is to begin on the ramshackle route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the long-term future of the racetrack shuttle, construction work on the track is due to begin before the end of the year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the state has committed itself to this link, which is particularly important for tourism," said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at around 2.5 million euros.
The country will take 75 percent of that sum.
The contract, on the basis of which the country will continue to order the shuttle in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringia Railway as the operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle is to be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a railway connection between the stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether enough people are using the route to order it regularly in the future.
The track is also very dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier, comes a new report on technological developments in sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we're going to see them a lot more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable partners to robots with silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford wife look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy," with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in the mood"! "
There are many unsettling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive feminine qualities, the allusions to rape when taking a step towards frigid (i.e., reluctant) Farrah, worry you most.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional extra.
Most men, of course, won't be holding sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times we live in.
And many people are not weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is some overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale 'is not the graphic images, the entwined bodies and the gouged eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply walk away.
They have no mediation or back story, nothing to suggest independence or anything to disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or, to use the 2017 phrase, maids:
Trump's big achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a Trump-era truism that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the US were offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We all try our best to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family she fought with for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same page.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in a wider context that it also carries significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the spooky possibility that one day his antics will no longer repel us.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly seem the epitome of reason by his standards.
These days, I find myself infested with active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, actually seem like very lenient offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican nominee only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the best three dollars to spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are snarky and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders in fear - extremely dark, and the clanking music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years on, and I'm still not quite past the day I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub doesn't count - but a large North London roundabout.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could swipe my credit card.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of matching the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was grinning apologetically as I had the tedium of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
It is the second time Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treatment for cuts to his wrists suffered after a fall in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013.
Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cubicle.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal Pistorius' six-year jail sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were sent off for the holidays and to secondary schools.
Three of the discharged pupils will go to grammar school in the future, and four to secondary school.
Principal Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and members of the public to the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm."
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making it a hen was dashed, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain, and vanished.
Afterwards, grades three and four performed a chicken dance in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goblins, who wore top hats, to compete.
The eagle stands for integration, said head teacher Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he would never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wanted every fourth-grader to feel accepted in their new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former head teacher Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in case of teaching bottlenecks, and the parents "representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was reluctant to let her students go after two years of teaching because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students sang a song about summer time and holiday time.
The children were very happy.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegal campers in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found to be staying in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The inspections will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court may impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6 cars.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives her assessment:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates apply only to vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The retrofitting was ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has said it will write to anyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within the framework of that inspection.
How long are the retrofits expected to take overall?
"Hard to say," says Smetanin.
That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
'Because we've seen that car manufacturers don't act voluntarily when it comes to the environment. '
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It can be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive cars made by BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait and see.
Foreign manufacturers are likely to follow suit, Smetanin said.
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars now imminent?
The ACE fears this.
But precisely in those regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J, 49, is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
This year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95), the cultural institution announced on Thursday.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
Lear, who made his name in progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not be taking part in the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of funding - and that burdens me."
Estefan, 59, said she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's master builder, will retire next year.
The position is already advertised - but suitable applicants are scarce.
Wacker has been a city architect for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the job, as he explains in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application fulfils the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
In this way, there should still be enough time for an introduction - taking into account the regular notice periods.
As Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Law Authority for the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft, the applicant must present corresponding qualifications.
The city definitely wants to keep this function.
If it were no longer able to fill them out, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city liveable," he is sure about the building authority and its employees.
Varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: the redevelopment of the former Hukla site and Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the renovation of the stadium is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
It's fun to work here. '
In terms of design, there is a great deal of leeway for a master builder.
With Haslach's own farm and nursery, a lot of things can be reacted to quite flexibly.
"A lot can be done," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the Old Town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, stresses the outgoing city architect.
In any case, the city's master builder bears great responsibility.
He is a builder, "at the end of the day it's all over my table."
He can count on long-standing employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay."
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, anyone wishing to inherit Roland Wacker should have completed a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulations and planning law.
The Municipal Planning Office is responsible for building and civil engineering, town planning, land acquisition matters, administration of municipal properties, municipal depot with building yard and municipal gardening as well as the Lower Construction Law Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown onto wires: Southern Railway line closed
According to the police, the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle off the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the wires.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators believe there are two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the early hours of the night.
Witnesses saw a pink scooter and a bicycle rider near the scene.
"This goes far beyond a prank," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator (s) would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of rail replacement, the perpetrators could also face fines from rail customers.
The total amount is expected to be "substantial," the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the Southern Railway line was able to continue without disruption.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which affected long-distance services.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and poles were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, this can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had. "
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments when the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She hypothesized that the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: 'The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the gut.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of this population. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40million signing from Chelsea started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, was ruled out of the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia and managed only 45 minutes, something Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
'We're going to help him be ready sooner rather than later. '
As well as Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho moulded his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings but insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of his four priority signings.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
'I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've worked hard. '
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots took off from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and stretched in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, that is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had done such advertising before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no interference from party headquarters, just no headwinds from within the coalition - that was the main wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, that has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff of the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD-governed provincial capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be remotely described with headwinds.
They were low blows.
One by one.
Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the German Editorial Network (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to hand back her mandate.
The change to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately relinquish her mandate, "the Green Party's national executive director and election campaign manager told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"That must not be true at all," sighs one SPD campaigner as the new bad news reaches party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without his own government majority after the conversion of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at that time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
And that was it - and it got a lot worse.
The defeat in Kiel left the SPD reeling, and the Düsseldorf bust flattened the party.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades laboriously rallied again.
Then, just as they had gathered new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong leader of the SPD, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was on fire.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards that you can do wrong.
Scholz has been fighting for his political survival ever since.
Now also Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the spotlight for some time because of the VW emissions scandal and his role in the supervisory board.
Lousy poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps because of this, Weil has been trying to set accents in the federal government more and more in recent weeks.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to increase his power in Berlin was not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They let him go because they thought he would stabilise the party.
Now, the exact opposite may be happening.
Weil is basically not to blame for the internal strife of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
For the time being, therefore, the comrades are endeavouring to keep their own ranks united.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and in particular renegade MP Tessa Jowell.
"It is intolerable and detrimental to democracy, how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten was not elected to parliament because of her personal standing as a direct candidate, but through the Land List of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MEP went on to say.
The logical consequence would be that she relinquishes her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic manoeuvre."
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for the town centre III
Who wants to renovate his aged house, can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Received.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
There have been redevelopment areas in Recfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations to date are a "success project" - after all, it is also important to promote interior development, and not just to develop new building areas.
On April 4, the Karlsruhe Regional Council informed them that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the land, the rest from the municipality received.
So how does a redevelopment area develop?
Schindler went on to say that they would investigate where the "really old" houses were.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to be redeveloped.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then shift again.
On Wednesday evening, the STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City," within the framework of which the refurbishments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per property.
The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The funding period has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in the context of which those involved in the redevelopment area would be given a questionnaire to fill in.
If possible, the statutes should be adopted in November or December, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban ills and deciding when and to what extent redevelopment will take place.
For the respective property then also a reorganization note is entered in the land register.
She promised that Pietzschmann himself would come back to Received and get an idea of the situation.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project was the participation of those involved.
Questionnaires will therefore be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Buildings and Properties" questionnaire, which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Household and Apartment Form," information on the size, layout and occupants of a living space can be provided.
The blue "company sheet" is only to be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of subsidies works according to the "first-come, first-served principle."
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
At the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown, in order to make a renovation "palatable" to those present.
British inventor puts a microchip to himself to get into house and car with just a flick of the wrist
A British inventor has become the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a flick of his wrist.
Steven Northam, 33, who had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger, is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure is carried out to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes just 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's firm also wants to modify the locks on homes and cars to make them compatible with the chip, all at an extra cost of £300 per lock.
The married father-of-one has now fitted technology to both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House Advertising Costs Taxpayers Thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military figures provided to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House featuring American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or QUESTION, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event at 3 p.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restrictions on service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were informed that it was not," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and touted efforts to curb government regulation.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to request their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was taxiing ahead of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the" Made In America "show - which features products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and on the South Lawn to drop the US President off at the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted toward the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not shoulder the burden for any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"Establishing the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
'The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week, 'Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It's obviously appropriate to highlight that. '
It was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
At the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
Top of the Second Tennis Bundesliga is the table-topping Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third place in the table Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite still having an unblemished record after five matches, the Bundesliga leaders have retained a sense of reality.
In any case, team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially in the back positions I think the team is very good. "
Above all, the imports from the far north provide class and stability for the Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles, "says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all from Denmark).
'It's going to be tough for us.
You need a good portion of luck. "
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north stands practically.
Maxime Janvier could make his debut for Blue and White.
If the Frenchman, who is still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing at the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was on the ball yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also move into the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill the squad.
How America Can Harm OMV
Donald Trump didn't seem happy Wednesday night when he signed into law the toughening of sanctions on Russia.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress had packed in some "unconstitutional provisions," he said.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels frothed at the US move.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Investors in the domestic OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Russian Baltic Sea together with other European companies, have been correspondingly concerned ever since.
The threat level is enormous.
Still, it is too early to assess the impact, the oil company's official statement said.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" has looked at which ones the corporation could fend off and which ones could really hurt it.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, Cali Cartel takes center stage in Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, with the first receiving its first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With its third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" with only more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to join the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Reverse role: The city is hiring 46 kitchen assistants
The city organizes the daycare lunch again itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In city daycare centers, the clock is being turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (daycare centers) on its own initiative.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the department for youth welfare, this is good news: "We were all very pleased."
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked and chilled food.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon.
Last year, 2,800 children sat at tables, and demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children, who are cared for 45 hours a week, eat lunch in the kindergarten," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
From 1 September onwards, 46 part-time staff will be on kitchen duty: they will heat up the food supplied, add lettuce, raw food and fruit to it, portion the meal individually, dispense the food, clean up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are firmly assigned to a day care center," Pommeranz says.
Size - there are two-group as well as seven-group institutions - determines the amount of lessons.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," Pommeranz says with satisfaction.
"This way they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement pedagogical concepts."
That's what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking classes.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in kindergarten, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - not only improves the quality of the kitchen performance, but also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical for the city in terms of the cost comparison between self-management and outsourcing, according to the press office.
This is despite 46 part-time staff being recruited.
"But these hours are not that important for about 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, have a role to play, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections, with three women running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will pass peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan's democratic success.
Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are alleged to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße, at around 2.55pm because they wanted to make a call on the girl's mobile phone.
But the 13-year-old refused the request and moved on with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without booty, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by police.
Investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment at Glasgow's McVitie factory
A union is seeking assurances from managers at biscuit maker McVitie about its long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said he had invested more than £5 million in the last few years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to know" if their jobs would change.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being taken forward."
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The lack of clarity from the general manager about Tollcross's business needs and investment plans for the future is deeply concerning to our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and Greater Glasgow, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic manufacturing decline, the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie. "
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate the continued engagement of staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site. If our operations at the site change, the first people to hear of this will be the employees and their union representatives. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189m bid to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about a world-record raid?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window, with the Ligue 1 club poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89million last season.
Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world when he finishes his career, with PSG offering wages in excess of £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan executive insists the club have always done their best to look after him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club wishing to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all clubs, 'he said.
But if they try to sign one of our players, there will be consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the effects of that interest by losing one of their bid for Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown offender deliberately knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of property number 30, causing damage to the fairing of the vehicle amounting to more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for information.
Police are appealing for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came into his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and hit the guardrail.
clock on Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came towards him in his lane, so he had to swerve to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage was caused to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking any notice of the accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not notice the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the polluter's vehicle to contact the Stolzenau police station under tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Cathedral sparrow report on abuse exonerates the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks so.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to generate discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur after publication that he expected an apology from the former bishop of Regensburg and now Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their misjudgement of events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the "double standard" applied to the coverage of violence by the Domspatzen.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future, but what is striking is the "degree of media manipulation," according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "People like to go to church and that's a feast for the eyes."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beatings were a perfectly normal educational means of coping with naughty children like me."
She thinks it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Quite wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the book of remembrance "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because none of this had anything to do with him," he assesses the conclusions of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer commissioned by the Regensburg diocese to investigate the matter, say?
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of attacks "with high plausibility," while 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, is quoted as saying: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were used by R. Domkapellmeister.
Particularly with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated R. "s general humanity and therefore in many cases, despite violence, they even associate him with positive memories."
In this interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburg Cathedral sparrows exonerates Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of violence against persons subject to protection by the Regensburger Domspatzen" paints a contradictory picture of the cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students emphasize his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a cathedral sparrow did not achieve a top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you view this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the whole 440-page report from beginning to end, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of preschool violence also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of having learned about it too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."
The vast majority of his pupils also give Georg Ratzinger an excellent certificate, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and who was "always surrounded by grapes from children."
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to tantrums.
Years ago, he himself admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for not only banging chairs and throwing the keychain on the floor, but also distributing slaps and pulling too cheeky boys by the hair or ears.
To save his honor, however, it must be said that in the period in question, the 1960 "s and 1970" s, such methods of education were widespread, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know of such methods of chastisement?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence in pre-school, these are, of course, trivial matters.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media outlets have pounced on him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still working hard for him.
The truth is, however, that the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect.
In connection with the report, much has been reported in the media on the subject of abuse at Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Definitely no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral chaplain.
Not even the parents were privy.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one of those affected testified on behalf of the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in exposing sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to their parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster, who in a professional sense would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: As one student put it: "With regard to sexual abuse... I don't see... any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it is... also really absurd to assume that just him... boys have opened themselves up more forcefully or more clearly or even sooner than to their parents, boarding school principals, confidence teachers, etc.
To talk to him about sex... it's unthinkable. '
The report concludes: "It could not be confirmed during the investigation that pupils and / or those around them had confided in him beforehand."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of failing to prevent or prosecute him.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
There was a lot to read in the media about the "excesses of violence" of the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking the other way" in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up to a huge mélange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a neat separation between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, shall we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible pedagogy of beatings, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the cathedral secondary school.
On this occasion, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
They were just happy to have escaped and enjoyed the much better treatment and, for many, even "paradise."
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, for whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R." s general humanity and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate him with positive memories. "
All that remains is the accusation of having looked the other way.
But despite its best efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was told about the conditions in preschool.
The first time was in 1970 / 71, when he was just starting to establish himself and did not want to hear about what was happening at a school where he was not working and was responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "caning continues in preschool."
Faced with the risk of negative press coverage, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when caning had long been prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as all of us are well aware.
Here, too, it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatised, and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked the other way.
This is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to the atrocities and violence committed against innocent children's souls in pre-school, which goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because none of this had anything to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was then banned, he adhered strictly to it.
What image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of caning also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, and tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen only played a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But even this has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to transform the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen into a world-class institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don't make great singers out of unruly boys and stand before every success, no matter in what field, but always discipline, passion and self-control.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the discussions on her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally kind, deeply faithful and kind-hearted person, one cannot imagine that he could do any harm to a fly.
I regularly hear how many former Cathedral Sparrows still maintain regular contact with him 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
So those who have not forgiven him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Cathedral Sparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect to whom they still look up and who they almost revere.
And please, let me be very clear: all he is accused of are the methods of education that were the order of the day back then.
We can be glad that we have come a long way from this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The malicious intent behind this is all too obvious.
The report that has just been published exonerates him.
Now the decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and without whom probably no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, should finally be left in peace.
