This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already widely accepted, but it provides more detail than fossils, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were brownish brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feather of the dinosaur does not have the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other features typical of feathers, beards, and barbels, the researchers concluded that the spine is likely the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these features.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or courtship. The researchers speculate that although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult feather and not a chicken feather.
The researchers hypothesized that although the tail belonged to a young dinosaur, the sample revealed adult plumage, not that of a chicken.

The activity was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was supposed to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth that generates tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same as those of "normal" matter.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a sort of halo, formed by a multitude of tiny particles.

The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's "sitting" category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than first-place Claudia Loesch of Austria, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers failed to finish their descent, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh police were able to recover the laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman, and we have also found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services were releasing the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his own son.
She is being held pending trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system has other parameters, as the Scottish courts have considered the publication of the photos to be potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspicious subjects are walking on minefields".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for judicial proceedings, told reporters that no further comment would be made until at least the formal indictment.
According to the leaked document, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other issues reportedly discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters in the experimental pest control programme had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS' Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have received extensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is the fifth election to Martelly's Provisional Council in four years.
Last month a presidential committee proposed a package of measures to push the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime, which began in October.
Occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure of elections, some of which had been scheduled since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 more incidents related to overheating, which the company called "not serious".
In its reply, the Ministry called the postponement of the report by Apple 'absolutely regrettable'.
The Marianne earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau, there were no reports of damage in the country.
And also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of a tsunami in progress.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Most of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then substituted for an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
After training as a midwife, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two 'black boxes' with flight records.
His wrestling mates also wanted to pay homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Moona was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman".
"Muna was as weird as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... let's hope she's in a better place", was the comment of Dustin "Goldust" Runnels.
According to a survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8% since 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of those polled, who believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.
In contrast, 29% of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three-man relay at the Commonwealth Games, but has blamed several disorders that have led to doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't take the pain medication because it's banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to the earth, the matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists are eager to understand how planets form and, in particular, how the earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor, and last month he signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He says that speculation is nothing but "political gossip and nonsense".
It is assumed that he will run for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking spaces available on site.
Fears about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of having the match played behind closed doors without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that the time needed for this process was much longer; this was due to the mating of an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
They can be worked into any kind of shape. They can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin thread, suitable for twisting and weaving, and can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, and it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" because of the ability to be made so thin.
It's called the pH of the substance, and you can build a pH indicator using the juice of the cabbage.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyte is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H-letter of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons whose electrons have been stripped away (since hydrogen atoms are formed from a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, put them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Nearly every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with running water and a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage networks have been discovered in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the many benefits it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and various other means of transportation appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on smaller, considerably larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret to their success, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and cubs that may reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The lion pack acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even as regards the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: The tiger is able to climb (though not very well), swim, jump very long distances, and exert a traction force five times that of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same family (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as the lion's, but it is more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots like to feed on small animals, and when possible they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the prey they catch is much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find food (prey) by smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Their night vision enables them to see very well in the dark, as well as to move stealthily, and to hunt their prey, ocelots mimic their surroundings and then plunge on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island, thus making it difficult for it to return), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterised by different resources and competitors, so to be a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously required.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process of forming new species is called speciation, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed in by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled by them (through respiration).
Plants process their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is made out of plants.
The mosasaur was the super predator of its era, and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws protruded over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't compete with it.
Although many of their foods may seem familiar, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a rodent called the giro.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to feast together while lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was accessible only to the priests.
At times, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to the god.
Because of the mild climate of the Middle East, home was not of paramount importance.
Much of the Jewish family life was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were mere outdoor stalls that faced the street, and stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a treasure map drawn.
Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So, probably, the annotation was just put on as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing fighting had brought the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those Frenchmen who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, which they called "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
By civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly larger group of people who live and work in collaboration, forming a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is, citizen, and "civitas", that is, city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, in the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass tax laws and interstate duties.
The amendment of the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, which had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey, and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh-largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipel", given the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was founded in the 15th century, when European sailors passing through it soon registered the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or marvelous island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that involved the aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese indentured labourers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most widely used film at the end of the analogue photography era.
It is still produced today, and more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had been a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and custom.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money reserves exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violated the international law usually accepted and codified by numerous international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different time periods were marked in a very singular way: each period of China or each ruling family constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between provinces. The most notable was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same is true for the military, since the rankings of the army, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the earthly life, and he used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers a very clear picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you knew it existed, and once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
Nothing is seen but a beautiful clear sky and a great number of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little of the world around you.
Of the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to the present day in a state of unbroken ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples, and the great Sphinx.
The major pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were built to honor the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The indication 'upwards' looks like a V and the indication 'downwards' looks like a graphite or a square without the lower side.
Upward means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and downward means you should start at the armrests (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow produces a louder, more determined sound.
You can decide to add your own personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the archetypal signs you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover much of the expenses and the interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous gains from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which the fate of man is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the automobile necessarily involves the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of road accidents, and consequently to the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured persons.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, treated by such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the framework of romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time customs, customs, and culture related to such geography emerged that, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Like Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its prestige declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles to the West may be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style.One of the most significant developments of the period, resulting from the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence farming when it is carried out for the sole purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually of an organic type, which uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of the harvest.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same views, who do not feel represented by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods of explaining the importance of socialization is to analyze some unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "wild" or "wild", and some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is totally raised by nonhuman animals, it displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of it, such as fear or indifference toward man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, much less a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is an example of a scaffolding, but so is the little graffiti-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to question, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide for nourishment, care and education, but it does happen to them.
We believe that the foster care represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trustee is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
The study of Eighmey and McCord (1998) on the public's reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal engagement" and "continuous relationships".
The use of video recording has led to significant breakthroughs in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to find out whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even argues that these abilities to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century research has shown the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With mutation, a new genetic variability is added, with selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - slowing growth, malnutrition, and, eventually, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10-60 minutes later).
This process can easily be practiced using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness, without waking you completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace that is proportionally opposed to the tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Enlightenment is a goal that can be reached only by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana Rite's love path and various Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-embracing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the center of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, soon proved obsolete, as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the more recent and noteworthy examples in support of this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, where the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had a chance to conquer Britain, as it had in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by ancient cultures and tribes for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and leather.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move about on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goat-like shepherds who were often children or adolescents.
Already in the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply parallel wooden axles, wagonways, compared with the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses to travel at higher speeds and to move heavier loads.
Bars were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became common practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels gave way to iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails appeared.
The first means of transportation known to man were legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "right man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate future suffering in some way, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problem and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, now known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap embroidery pieces still known are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one class of dinosaurs survived and is still alive, and that's what we call birds.
Many tend to dismiss them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that they have in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers in use today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but its symptoms, including vomiting, are so general that immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or harmful chemicals in the home.
Check that the label contains first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have adapted strongly to become parasites of man.
Both killer and bed bugs are nesting, adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States of America, MS has about 400,000 known cases, making it the number one neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also helps to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behaviour depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by means of biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to periodic external signals, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells belong to the germ line.
The only mutations that can be passed on to offspring are those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism draws people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to be carried out on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information on the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to work, crossing other people whose place of work is the place they just left.
In this dynamic of commuting, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they also support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behaviour tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show a reasonably constant range and can be represented in a generic mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) volume, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Many insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small prey to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many others believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't have a sense of the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching six miles in width at some points.
The Amazon River is responsible for 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The language of the Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper in ancient times. These elements can be found in nature in native form and can be extracted quite easily with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These actually more closely resemble the four states of matter, that is (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minute amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so that trillions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil has thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on their computer screens and never has to approach a temperamentalist.
We can only wonder what fate will befall the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then, by further splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner, which has facilitated the lava rising to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start managing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge: on the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, to implement disciplinary actions, to evaluate performance, to define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the whole team's work and do it.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often causes disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may take place in different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
An 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organisation be willing to tackle the long process of building a learning organisation? A good reason for implementing organisational learning concepts may be innovation.
When all the available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the collaborative path within an organisation to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have shown the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition.
The link between brain disease and behavior is at the heart of scientific research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injury and cancer can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before observed.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite its strong science fiction connotation, AI is a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of application are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as speech, facial and writing recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real problems.
AI is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various home computer and video game software applications.
Tours are a fundamental part of teaching, and teachers often want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is technology with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills, as their first experiences with blogging are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgments the author of the blog is committed to improving his writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to feed the public's interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning well beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's evocative, bilingual capital, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north you can admire the unspoiled natural beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result may surprise many: In the United States, there are more African-American citizens than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama opened the way for European influence and colonialism.
The region is bounded by the Sahel in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
For women travellers: it is recommended that all travellers declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the courage to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.; under the name of Anfa, it was a strategic port used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it as Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city that was called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a lot of other fine art, but all of this is reserved for tourists only.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to do a good job of documenting yourself before making any visits outside Goma, so as to assess the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
A boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) is available to get around Goma, with a normal price (in local currency) of about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Also as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decaying city, but its reputation has left it a tourist attraction, with an airport.
In 1990 it was included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, because of the threat posed by desert sands.
In the Henry Louis Gates special of PBS "Wonders of the African World" it was one of the main milestones.
With its more Arab than African feel, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs east along the border with Mozambique, north to Zimbabwe, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily contributions for conservation and park entrance.
The purchase of a Wild Card could also be useful, as it gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart, made even more noticeable by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island has been concentrated on the heavily populated reclaimed land of the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove coastal belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain what remains of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable, sturdy Japanese minibuses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast means of reaching nearby localities, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two trunks are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two aisles 3.50 metres wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres and was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its native identity and peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place at the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
Information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches is available from the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers the currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley is often also available for credit cards and U.S. dollars.
On outlying islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currencies may be accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature below that recorded by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/metres from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem - bison, moose, deer, bears - virtually any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep a proper distance, and they must be given adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also, keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing along or cooking foods with strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoan Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two ports.
The Pacific Ocean-facing beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide variety of shops, and you can swim safely.
The most popular local beer is a simple, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines might be better for the trip.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you're afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, flat white coffee is a foreign idea: espresso is short black coffee, cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian hot chocolate, and fruit juices are expensive, but they're very good.
Many excursions are made on the reef throughout the year, and accidents from one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow the directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubed medusa appears from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of them and tend to stay away.
The saltwater crocodile's habitat is mainly the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, and they do not live actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind to find a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can still be booked through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer breakfast packages, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the action, you have to arrive early and get a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lingers into the late night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time to explore the city.
Generally, casinos do everything they can to maximize the time and money their guests spend, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of the guests up and make sure they stay.
In some places alcoholic beverages are served from the house, but drunkenness alters judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice or near-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you get stuck.
Rainfall and snowflakes, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors' holidays.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips made overland, particularly in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so a normal set of equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes fearful, so you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hike safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, the first being held in 1964.
If your 2020 flight and accommodation booking was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary among them, however most coronavirus-related cancellation policies, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry them. Many hotels offer the use of ironing iron and iron axes, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironing socks, you can try a hair dryer, if you have one.
Care should be taken not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to treat water, and some of these are proven to be more effective against specific hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so in case of doubt, consideration should be given to buying water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers may come into contact with animal pests which are not common in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free purchases are an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive, as it often crosses isolated areas of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow turns predominate.
The speed limits are much lower than those applied on the preceding and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h).
Strangely, however, the level of mobile phone service coverage in this area is much higher than in other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rather tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit sweets are a timeless classic, from those with year-round apples to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to try small but rich-tasting sweets can choose what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid it contains.

Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of simple dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The braces are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may present safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is kicked by a horse but has a foot stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures you can take.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially the British, incorporated safety bars, which caused a leather strap to detach from the saddle when, in case of a fall, the rider pulled it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are carved.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking vistas, with climbers from all over the world continually tracing new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Free-fall snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and involve skidding on the snow using skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (the skiers), who dedicate entire periods of vacation to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first rock paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing: The activity is also called outdoor skiing, alpinism or trekking on skis.
It is related, though usually not included, to ski touring or skimo, which are practised on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski run as a similar route to hiking.
If the conditions are right, you may be able to cover some distance more than those trails by walking, but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speed without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries.Usually, to travel through several countries you would need to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area operates rather as one country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to the other without having to go through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, saving time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique, but some tax authorities consider an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, even if they are more recent than similar series-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis for many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived by fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as working animals.
Today, many Sámi are engaged in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.

Transgender people in the pre-op stage should not expect to pass screening without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The backflow is the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most deaths occur because of fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're off the power, it won't be any harder than usual to swim back.
Try to identify an area where you are not likely to be trapped again, or evaluate whether to wait for rescues, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.

Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture may find it difficult to readjust to the culture of their home country.
When you return home from living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the uses of your native culture.
In your first experience abroad, you have likely met people who are patient and understanding, aware that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness would be needed for those returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the show begins, the pyramids will be seen in darkness and silence.

The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, the caldera of a still-active volcano filled with water from a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region that lies south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 200-mile-long chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m (14,932 ft) with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to make a call you have to be out in the open with the satellite's view clear.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as by missions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the more popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among newly graduated students, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education in one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programmes requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love sailing. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also contains thousands of islands, both in the interior of the lakes and in the coastal archipelagoes.
You don't need a yacht to go to the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted for every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is 1 in 40).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.

Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany.As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest toward other things.
For some people, understanding a little bit about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or the fact that you have no control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver goods quickly, and timing is often very important for company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
For some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as hold baggage, and that's where you come in, since airline regulations don't allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a good amount for the privilege (or, better yet, convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: for example, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal low-cost fare for business travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class travel!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class or business-class seats.
The airlines know well that there is a category of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge certain fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, and the local language is Romanian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Orthodox Christian one.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.

One tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional churches an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, the mammals could not cope with the journey, and the giant tortoise became the principal grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark for most of the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can even enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office clothing is normally a jacket and tie or a suit and colleagues are addressed by surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it gives importance to group engagement rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' approval on every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without question.
