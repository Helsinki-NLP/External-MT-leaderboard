More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian lamp was put into operation in Gutach on the village parking lot - in sight of the older city hall lamp.
Two plants so close to each other: intent or shield strike?
This question was clearly answered by the mayor of Gutachs yesterday.
"The town hall was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser lamp saves both cyclists and bus passengers and the inhabitants of Bergle.
The facility, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the crossroads Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area 'Grub'.
"Due to the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another lightning had to be made for their safety," Eckert said.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg County Council.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Safety is just going on here," says Arnold.
In total, four traffic visits were carried out, a circular traffic was also planned, but was rejected due to the congestion in the cruise area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested when choosing the location of the light bulbs: "With the help of an extra for us with especially long wooden stems loaded transporter, we tested whether these vehicles can get out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the light bulb."
The lamp system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is “the most modern one that is currently available on the market,” Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights from the drivers are well visible, for example, even in the deep sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for pedestrians can be completed.
“If a group or disabled people are to cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can safely cross the track,” Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver must think as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the light for pedestrians green, a high-end vehicle came through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the languagelessness, the inclination to brute violence and stupid sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - has the Kärntner poet described many times.
The Buchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prosaautor, theatrical texts are rare in his work.
Collage from proso texts Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of proso texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the garage X on Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosamiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage – an important requisite: a crushed sofa on which it is supposed to copulate and masturbate – the eight-person ensemble hangs through the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of directions known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are hard touched, with their heads immersed under water, with their evening dresses tapped to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or meadows, they stumble on dangerously high stems through the staging, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this intense way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songwriting.
Only at the end of the exaggerated performance comes a little to rest, and Winklers after all absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, believing they have found the solution in a small black box that can be placed in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every mile traveled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the U.S. state planning agencies to revise the outdated system for funding U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colourful alliances.
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and are advocating that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax reductions.
The tea party is terrible.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while you can’t agree on a move in Congress, several states don’t wait any longer.
They are currently considering how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the driving screens, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re just going to potentially use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record miles driven by all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes Americans pay on the pillar, is bankrupt.
In America, however, there is no longer as much dance as it used to be.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
With high alcohol prices, politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with roadmaps to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, as the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behavior in a way that reduces congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California planners rely on the system in developing strategies to the state’s ambitious, legally-enforced climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of paying drivers after the journey.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to concerns from MPs from rural areas, who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or into the city in their daily lives.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently hiring 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently exploring how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could track each of their movements.
“Preoccupations about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and result management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People did not want it.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the driving recorders into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, vast technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to record the miles travelled, but not exactly when and where.
This, according to Khan, would also make the public more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not come up to help states tax car drivers.
Rather, their goal was to set foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of miles travelled.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for street planners, as they don’t work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more likely to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other sites hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that will also allow parking fees to be paid, insurance will only need to be paid for miles taken, and speed data from other vehicles will be collected in real time, allowing drivers to avoid traffic jams.
“Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers,” says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile isn’t just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials stated that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles or other low-fuel vehicles, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no need for surgery if one aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the head of legislation and public affairs at the European Commission.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
King's Field: Small team struggles
The Volunteer Fire Service handled its autumn main test with bravery despite a shortage of personnel.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property in Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There should have been a shortcut in the speech.
Two people were injured in the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two respiratory protectors of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building after the first check of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time, they managed to find the first person and lead him out.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy because there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stand for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for woodworking.
The first attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out over a overfloor hydrant about 100 meters away.
Three assault attacks were carried out.
There was also a hole radiation tube in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer also focused on showing what could be achieved with little staff available.
In case of emergency, assistance is provided through the Königsfeld day service group.
The officer was satisfied with the outcome of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf also informed himself in Titisee-Neustadt about where the labor force of tomorrow comes from.
At the Funding Centre Hochschwarzwald, he worked with the managing directors of the vocational schools, the district gymnasium and the chairmen of the parental council on this important issue.
“Education is an important location factor,” said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Hochschwarzwald Education Centre.
At the same time, Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Funding Centre, the District Gymnasium and the Vocational School Centre in Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the district.
“It is important to consider not only the family phase, but also the care of relatives due to demographic changes,” Wolf said.
He also noted that more and more employees are taking care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workforce, he said.
Another important factor is the networking of universities and.
"Because those who have already learned about the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, they are often left to the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," he said.
Because only if enough training places were offered, the need for specialist personnel could also be covered.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Remain stubborn and make sure that public transportation is improved," he explained to the local politicians present.
Music for a fun afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then a vesper.
Previously, the elderly were housed in the resting place.
This afternoon will be held at St. Joseph's Hospital.
The residents were delighted with the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was salad.
With common melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old school courtyard facing the renovation to Kirchstrasse will again be included in the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first renovation works of the front school yard, to stabilize and statically relieve the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with a balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure includes the involvement of the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and the creation of a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made next year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, as a follow-up measure, the restored boundary wall needs to be renovated from scratch and put on new underpinnings in the foreseeable time.
The historic, one hundred years old border wall of the old school court to the Church Street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, because there is no drainage, needs to be repaired and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual rocks indicate weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use the school yard, which has been done through the current fortification work.
The renovation of the school yard was originally planned for the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a postponement.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be the State Memorial Office.
Should specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments protectors.
Students of the Bräunlinger Elementary School, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined.
“I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music,” Özdemir told Stuttgart News.
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz site Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag elections on September 22, the Green-Red Land government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is forcing a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: “Super Tunnel” for drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and closed a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500-meter pipeline between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar,” Southern California Attorney General Laura Duffy told a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured, “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to exploit them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume it was designed by architects and engineers and that construction took about a year.
The railway system was equipped so that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also be suitable to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment as a maximum sentence, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the “despair” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, Bill Sherman of the drug detection agency DEA in San Diego said.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
Details of the detainees were not disclosed, at least one was Mexican, it said.
They must expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
2014 is Geisinger Festival Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer.
If the year ends in eight weeks, it will be the anniversary year.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches, a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th, there will be an official inauguration of the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this inauguration will take place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Church-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church-Hausen celebrates 1250 in July on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a feast, on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall.
On this holiday weekend there is also the church-house church festival.
The city music director Rudolf Barth has written a commission composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the sunrise celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
It will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will also be released.
"It is to be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 was the space of today with the conspiracies.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Narrenzunft begins on 8 February with a customary evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will have a banquet on 29 March and then celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Music Club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first documentally mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which at the time was a courthouse.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
In addition to celebrating this 1250-year anniversary in 2014, there are also 40 years since the municipal reform.
The council takes tracks into consideration
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt extensively to increase traffic safety?
The municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach will have to pay 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway route next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must share a third of the costs, the rest is shared by the Railway and the Bund.
Schiltach city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the railway crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bay at the height of the tunnel mountain west of the railway line.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting long timber, standing against traffic without having to block the lanes.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could expand the subsequent road at a given time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the city council, as some councils questioned the need for a road spread: with his statement, Thomas Kipp brought the sentiment of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: the railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long timber transportation.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would need to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway transit "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transportation significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned expansion of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway crossing with the condition that the necessary support wall would be built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to about 5.5 meters, if necessary, for meeting traffic.
The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could, on the other hand, bring about a completely different problem, which affects access to the heavily rising "Gerolthäuser Weg".
The administration had asked the engineering office Breinlinger to examine the reform plans of the railway, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Gerolthaus Wegs would then still be possible.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as the road building carrier.
The modification may result in liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the twist functioned in the current state of development, one should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway transition, Haas argued.
Also at this point the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transit is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because directly next to it is the stop in the middle, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be stopped at this point so that no collision threat.
In most cases, the approval for the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused, as the city of Schiltach would have to "solve the problem with sitting vehicles", according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction works.
As unproblematic, the panel considers the reconstruction of the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossings agreements have already been made with the railway.
ESA Decides on Large Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves, or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
Thirty proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
The distant worlds.
Astronomers have found more than 1,000 planets near other stars.
Whether there is life on some of them, nobody knows.
The choice is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are designed to significantly advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now come to the closer election.
Numerous bodies review the proposals, followed by the researchers.
A final decision will be made by the Scientific Program Committee in the coming days.
In total, the ESA has selected four major questions to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision program initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The precise processes of star formation from large gas clouds – and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars – are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can there be life?
In order to address this question, in 2017 the Space Telescope "Cheops" will be launched, using which 500 already known planetary systems in our nearest environment will be studied more closely.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to indicate biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
In the end, this question is also meant to provide an explanation of the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA has already approved a M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this matter.
The spacecraft will launch in 2017 to monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the evolution of the solar system.
This is the first of three L missions in the Cosmic Vision program.
The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and will study the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Per there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under the roof of which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe form and what is it made up of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was formed by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, consisting of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, whose action accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already authorized a M-mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to study the distribution of matter in the universe across the sky for the first time, allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who can run the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chance of being approved as a L-mission has, according to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Among them, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, hopefully the scientists behind the project.
The mission will include a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
It could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena" to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to track and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics have already been submitted.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: “Even though the outcome of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment where no defence is possible.”
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden says he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the US government to drop the charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice charges include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany are stressed by allegations that the NSA intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, stated that one should seize the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness if possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs assurances that he is “safe” there.
In his letter, Snowden said he faced a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his homeland.
But he was touched by the worldwide reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though Wednesday’s announcement read that passengers are expected to keep the entire box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags below the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travellers who just paid on board.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began charging fees for the first and second baggage.
Passengers who attempted to bypass these have therefore placed as much as possible in hand luggage, resulting in the luggage compartments above the seats often being overcrowded.
Fees are a way to motivate passengers to take less on board.
O’Malley said the new fee isn’t really about making money.
These are the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the shop above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that one passenger may be allowed to take one piece of luggage free of charge at Frontier’s departure, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley explained that Frontier’s website and check-in procedures will be changed so that passengers will be informed of the fee before they arrive at the departure.
The new hand-luggage fee from Frontier will only come into effect in the summer, a precise date is not yet known.
Passengers often cheat about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street see the new luggage charges as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, so far leave the finger of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first charged hand luggage three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, airline consultant Jay Sorensen said, who is closely monitoring the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s hand luggage fee generates $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him on board if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see toothbrushing and hands-on discussions on the runway.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding went like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice are expected to keep the entire can and coffee will be replenished for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge money for refreshments in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company followed.
Frontiers’ move to charge for hand luggage when passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to purchase directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the longest in this area.
In September, the company began to allocate only half as many multi-flight miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were reduced to 25% of the flight distance.
Therefore, a flight booked with a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles only brings customers 250 miles in.
Passengers can also book seats exclusively through direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and flight capacity shrunk by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has sought to take control of Frontier’s finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
More than 40 women attended the last women’s breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was “Prophetic words from the Bible” and “Prophetic words from the Middle Ages”.
Zita Köhler, the chairperson of the church council, spoke about the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
“Prophetic words contain life wisdom, regulations, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: wooden eye be vigilant, like scales falling from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone, whose own is the Lord in sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also let her listeners guess which proverb it was.
In the Middle Ages, Christel Dehner said, “All good things are three, to make blue, to hide something.”
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called “bridges into the past.”
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and described humorously before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for unlearned in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Seenplatte a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched today.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already employed in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with graduation," said Carmen Wiechert of the labor agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals, which were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says it was an “internal mistake” and not hackers to blame the crash
The shadowy National Security Agency stated late Friday that an error has paralyzed its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because of an internal error during a scheduled update,” the agency said in an email.
The problem will be fixed tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
Early in the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was inaccessible for at least six hours, and for some users it is still inaccessible.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website will be flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site crashes.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the target system’s internal network.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was No Search Agency, is now in the light of the public and faces sharp criticism after the revelations of its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and released by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the intelligence service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of unemployed in October dropped slightly by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of office of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
So far, many companies have responded behavior in hiring.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, healthcare and old-age care."
Since September, there have also been job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry.
In mid-December the winter season begins.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblad of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier loses profits following decline in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc. a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by falling aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September, according to the ambitious schedule.
After the first flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, there have been only three more launches so far, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results were below the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday, considering that the stock has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of the margins in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft line will catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company’s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program is on schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft’s standby time.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, which we also did.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft into service twelve months after the Virgin flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing its plan for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight tests – even though they are obviously in line with Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning is delayed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended on September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly and fell from 4.2 billion to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Orders in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, remaining unchanged compared to December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within our limits, but the low order input and overall market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division increased by just over 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transport segment was $32.6 billion on 30 September, which was slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been compromised by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to the company’s management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In Thursday's afternoon trading, Bombardier shares fell by 8.5 percent to $4.83 after Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette was also announced to move into the board.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, a decrease of ten percent in quarterly profit on Thursday.

Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison.
A well-known lawyer who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed “Bash,” was arrested in his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he represented in a previous drug case.
Officials observed Scarborough delivering three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on his credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a large investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash during a series of home searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges of obstructing justice.
He previously admitted possession of cocaine.
The lawyer was transferred after police in their investigations against Scarborough discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house, where he laid the drugs under the lawyer's rubbish with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf gloves.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after testing found class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but refused to take cocaine, saying that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to "lawyer secrecy."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he runs an office both at his private address and at the workplace and clients would call him home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called key drug trafficking players, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of those people.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has thus brought his professional position into question.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any misconduct and claimed, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it right away.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta made the move from a criminal lawyer to a criminal at the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public trust and confidence.
Ditta has broken this confidence and tries to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiring to traffick heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug crimes.
On his website, Ditta posted a section of questions and answers about himself, stating that his dream job as a lawyer was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen song crown will frame two worship services with the "German Mass" of Franz Schubert.
Following the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which excited the audience in the spring of this year, the song crown will enrich two worship services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10:15 at the liturgy in St. John's Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is performed within the framework of the worship services, as commissioner Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir will be accompanied by the blazer group of the musical association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Skepticism increases confidence
With the 2015 parish council elections, for example, fundamentals will change in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For there is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became clear: the skepticism about the new one is reluctantly shifting from a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees had extremely constructive conversations with the principal officers of the pastoral team.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained, through a presentation, the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a public law body that enters into the rights and duties of the six separate church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented.
At least two elected members should be represented from each parish, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed on the spot.
In the future, their mission will be to promote church life in the area.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish communities there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations stipulate that accumulated credits in the parishes will remain dedicated.
The obligations, on the other hand, go to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then affects all parishes, there were great concerns.
“In the past, too, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes on their own,” Haslach’s parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach said.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the panel in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task in 2006 to “Be One, Stay Five” and had to find that it wasn’t that easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Pastoral Unit then began to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concretized in further meetings and will be decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity is becoming more expensive in Pfullendorf
Citizens of Pfullendorfs must prepare for higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, to the SÜDKURIER, an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year applies to a family of four Pfullendorfer.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG volume from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This boundary is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by them as a result of the energy transition, which they can charge over the price of electricity.
The town works of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed in its forecasts a higher turnover, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're expecting an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number likely to be close to 2 cents.
Lightning on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a lamp simply doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do when driving in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough for a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue to drive, Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before assuming a failure of the lamp.
Those who continue to drive despite the red light, however, must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who are patient for less than five minutes may not wait long enough under certain circumstances, Becker warns, referring to a ruling of the Hamm High Court.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of permanent red and had to take responsibility for a negligent violation of the red light.
The lamp was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but not the fine.
The council is pleased with a solid budget.
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipal sac in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known any debt since 2005.
In this respect, the 2012 financial year can also be counted as a complete success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was more than one million euros higher than planned, with around 7.6 million euros.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about one million euros above the approach, with approximately 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is due mainly to higher industrial tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The property budget was also significantly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
As less investments were made in the financial year 2012 than planned, the deposit was also higher.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to now a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for their good work.
"Such a work is not just shaken out of the sleeve," Gerster praised in view of the annual account.
He and the city councils were obviously pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but just these good figures could soon cost the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to avoid high leverage rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have been cut several times.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensation schemes.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain leverage rates.
"We need to look at the topic of leverage, as there are investments in the coming years for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history with the male singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in the context of which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now more than loved choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and loyalty to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him – since the choir is also a church choir – a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association, as well as a engraved cinderella.
In addition to the tribute, the 31st Autumn Festival went on in the usual ways: with the MGV Betra, the Salzstetten Liederkranz, the Singersabteilung Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
To their honouring singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small standing - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men’s singing group Betra also sang classical choir songs such as Julius Wengert’s “Jägerwerben”, Hubert Goisern’s “Weit, weit weg” and the folk song “Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal”.
Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women’s group – the “Impulchor” – provided for the women’s quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped Antos Gus in foreign countries with the Napolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana", while the "Impulchor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to local fields with "What isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer set up a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were well occupied over the lunch.
Children’s Dreams Become Real
The kindergartens and daycare centers in the Zollernalb district receive mail these days.
The Schwarzwälder Bote, in collaboration with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the establishments in the realization of their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participating in the action can all kindergartens, daycare centers and children's cribs from the entire Zollernalbkreis.
If you have a building or decoration wish for your facility, you can apply with it to Schwarzwälder Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Building Site.
A jury composed of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb will select three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and in one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many diligent construction assistants.
What about the day and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Zollernalb savings fund.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the assistants.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenya press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask: what is it that prevents parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it’s an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, "effectively takes the media into a grasp."The Standard, on the other hand, writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow," and titled the draft as "draconian."
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in response to the September attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center.
The Kenyan media raised the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras that showed the units dispatched to the scene allegedly looting the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by inviting two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the invitation was withdrawn after a media outcry.
According to the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what they describe as Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
If they silence the media, politicians can do whatever they want without punishment.
“Nobody will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who described Kenya’s media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If politicians are left to themselves, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
Kenya’s lawmakers have already caught public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and resumed their regular salaries of approximately 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – one of the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes a reality for the FC
On the importance for the city and the football club, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass field did not matter despite the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone would have desired a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
Thus, all those who came without umbrella or could not hold one for any reason had a look back.
This went to the musicians who framed the feast, as did many speakers.
FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker spoke of fulfilling a dream.
He thanked primarily Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the association members who contributed.
This includes Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The restful retirees placed 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new roads.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also praised by Landtag MP Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were delivered to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation to the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn add so much to the original lawn that it could not be played.
As early as 15 years ago, there were the first considerations for solving the problem, when the construction of a third square at the site of the football club or at the real school on the Salinensee was thought.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, the idea of setting up a artificial grass sporting field emerged, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was initiated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the state approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining €356,000 at the total cost of €560,000, Klumpp summed up.
The construction of the 68 x 108 meters tall artificial grass square began on June 4.
During the construction phase, which lasted more than three months, 3,000 cubic meters of land were disposed of, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike route.
The Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal affairs and justice.
The working group met in Berlin this morning.
Among them are direct democracy, parliamentary bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among them is the question of dual citizenship, where both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the topic of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car fee demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for diversity and therefore ecologically counterproductive," SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, explained in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evacuation on rural roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the outdoor stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday night at the open air stage Killesberg.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions are for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old woman from Musch was driving her car on the Kempener outer ring towards Grefrath around 21.15.
When she wanted to turn to the left on St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old’s car.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: closure after accident on the Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left track of the two-track Reichsstraße.
Shortly before the circulation at the Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left runway towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right runway.
The crash occurred with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constance.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old driver behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 property damages were caused, police said.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport stops passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be such passengers at Vienna-Schwechat airport.
A large part of the speaker translations fall away with this - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Vienna, the Vienna airport is following an international trend with the suspension of passages affecting individual persons.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai, among others, are already relieving the noisy calls.
By removing these passages - on average, about 200 personal calls are heard by the speakers in a day - it is expected to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual passages were relatively little perceived, but at the same time, all other information about changed take-offs or departure times here a bit disappear," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car riding with tractors, a second competition will be held at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 13:30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabishly breathed on the cold farm.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines tree throwing, horse throwing and water throwing.
Four and a half meters the trunk is long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It doesn’t matter to the extent,” explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, should be overwhelmed once and then just come to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
When throwing horses, it depends on the target accuracy.
From a distance of eight meters is thrown on a pflock.
Competence and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water trains over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the individual and team competitions will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 p.m.
A suitable dress is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scottish dress.
But swallowing is also permitted.
For “Outfit” the jury will award a few bonus points.
Registration can be made up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the land on Saturday.
In the evening, the blasmusic friends come at their expense.
At 7 p.m. the biraböhmian blasmusik from Schömberg will organize the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fine polkas and marches.
However, their repertoire also includes sensual rollers and a saturated big-band sound.
With him will be the singing host and blackworm baron Heinz Koch known for a while under the rings.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool’s smell.
On Sundays, the music club will entertain Leinstetten for early jumping, from 14 a.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen will be the guest, and the "Oldies" will then let the feast out.
Starting on Friday is the Stoppelacker Party with DJ Ralf.
Other program points on Saturday and Sunday include, among other things, the Oldtimer and Trappertreffen, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the maize labyrinth, the craftsman’s market and the sheep shredder.
Especially for children there is a streichel zoo, strohhüpfburg, tractor ride (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Multi-purpose Hall, the Skiclub and the tractor friends "Zündkappsele".
Milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pure tofu with plant seed, for example, is a quartz replacement.
The World Vegetarian Association celebrates World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
The Vegetarian Association of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on November 1:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oatmeal, almond or rice milk can be used.
Replacing plant sands replaces conventional sands.
There are also vegetable alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mushroom or a tablespoon of ground linen seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Slowers are made with pasta instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of one teaspoon baking powder, one tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleeping in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest High School students got to know the great American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed off to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of Manhattan on foot.
Here was already offered a fascinating view of the world famous skyline, which in the evening light makes a special charm.
Because of the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial site of September 11.
On the third day, students from the 373 meter high viewing platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city while enjoying the views.
After that, we went through the hectic drift of New York’s streets through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a fairly ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Lüttich.
The jagdhornbläsergruppe of the jagdreiter Westfalen under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) based on ancient, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear horseback clothes because they mostly accompany riders, horses and dogs on trailers.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11:30.
The newly designed shade shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
Déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed by the feeling that you have already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the same name café at the upchlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the cafe with the beautiful name has exactly this purpose: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but handy and repeatedly experienced.
Because it is fun and just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the 8th shock gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art but not cool cafe environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top delights the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made themselves a name as gastronomists before the opening of the jewelry café at the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they run the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the raid, the sympathetic coffee lovers hoped for more audiences.
Not least by the university.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to address young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
About coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most diverse variations yourself.
Expressionist
Daniel Büttner is more the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
“There’s a baguette – that’s my thing,” she told NRZ.
There were two events at the cafe.
Better to say one.
Because the port festival was held outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
“Beautiful, successful and funny,” the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone’s thing.
Per Daniel Büttner is also not a pronounced fan of event evenings: "You can't do it right for everyone."
And with an event, I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
Events will be the exception for us.
“We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible.”
Déjà Vu also means reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the upchlag in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the pleasure of many clichés, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomies and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had come with pleasure.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone the harmonious coexistence in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also the appropriate celebration to make honors.
The special award “Singer of the Year” was this time awarded to writer Rolf Wagener.
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but also made so many rounds for us, for which our heartfelt thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir trials through activity streams went to choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was held by notary Artur Brückner.
The board of directors expressed a special gratitude to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted an extra-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at its regular choir tests every Tuesday at 19.45 in the club hall.
“New songs are always welcome to us,” says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the Millennium Goals, which ended in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world political leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that it was time to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These targets will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not shy away from carrying out this mandate given to me by the Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals.”
Although the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball top league.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this.
Everyone is fully motivated for this.
I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the Third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped any trees, Malmon raises the point finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players in the A-Jugend.
You will be motivated against your ex-coach.
"In addition, we have to wait to see if there will be reinforcements from the first," explained the SG-coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely boost in comparison to previous appearances.
Especially in the covering work and in the switching game, it has failed enormously.
The exploitation of opportunities must also be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Afraid of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the white ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a mature conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge coastal gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring over $50 billion of investment in the country in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members on October 17 in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamos fort.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamo’s spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to degrade concerns about instability.
He told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “loser” who “wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo would give up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are hitting their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a disturbing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s election success has shrunk since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the election.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, which mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded with restraint to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has further increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said the people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” one author thinks.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic,” children would be “completely shut off” because in entertaining stories the messages were “subjugated.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Per the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally depicted, by which history is revealed and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hanjakob moves again to Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years lived in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were delighted by the extremely short-lived play.
From his arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a fun piece, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time springs from youth to the upcoming retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returned home to his children’s heaven, to his free court.
And then began the stage play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he led with the Zweispänner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he welcomed by the audience with great applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly good at putting himself in the role of the sister and gave her an enormous life in mimic and gesture.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitably selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
To be awarded the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honored, who represented the then official Hättich together with a part of the city council.
Their attendance was subsequently made by the three-king singers, who caused Hansjakob to shout out: "Oh, how beautiful, there again youth memories of my own three-king time become alive."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the public in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the local church at the time, as well as his concerns about the outbursts in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the Heimaterde, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless mind had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the play.
A lot of applause and praise came from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants grows
The chances of leaving the league of the sporting downward Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wild card procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project has waived an application for a possible backpacking place.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been drafting the concept for a professional club in the Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is clear that Düsseldorf does not get a license," Neckar-Riesen boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Up until 23 May, Düsseldorf Baskets will be able to submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic competitiveness for the Bundesliga.
However, the Rhineland has been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Dinnerskirche comes in sight
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office will dedicate the last of its public thematic tours this year on Sunday, October 27.
After visiting the atomic cellar museum, the Haigerlocher period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final point is a visit to the dinner church.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a completely Catholic area.
Last but not least, in the church there is also a look at the dinner painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the one-and-a-half-hour guided tour is at 15:00 at the Atom Keller Museum.
The cards are at the box office of the Atomic cellar museum.
For questions and information, the Tourism Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. follow-up affair.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was by the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, he said.
Snowden’s departure from Russia is almost impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status," the agency quoted a source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there, it said.
Long breathing pays off.
Six men's teams fought in the tennis tournament of the clubs for the winning title.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the final match.
A dream weather had received the tennis division of sports fans Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The game of tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or maximum 45 minutes of duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
Tournament management was in the hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the crucial phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the winning ceremony, Carmen Müller was able to hand over the Wandercup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was won by Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze ladder was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
With late afternoon sunshine and coffee and cake, the successful outcome of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children’s and family festival with numerous participation activities and events.
"Both big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, filtering or making ropes, for every age, there is something suitable.
Children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 to 17 p.m.
Workshops are also held in the museum.
In the construction of coconut pipe, water wheels or rollers, the young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
Have fun also promise the many old games, such as chariot racing or racing.
Speed and coordination are needed.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 14 a.m. each.
During a walking tour, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lies.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a ski ride with Black Forest Foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be met and admired on the site.
Additionally, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who will drive his shabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
Comfortably and fairy tale, in the meantime, it goes to Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11:30.
In addition, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 17 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the beezbinder, the shaver, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be watched over their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are expected to have a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable buzz because he planned to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not distracted from his dream, despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old factory shops, he moves by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Snoring disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the halls.
The company has several iron on fire at the site.
In addition to importing coal, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind logistics, among others.
Black shades the coal on the warehouse in front of the deck.
Two enormous blue shovel and recharge engines distribute or load the coal here as needed.
At every movement of the envelope devices, a sharp warning noise sounds over the terrain.
“The signals serve security and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is widely heard in an unfavourable wind - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore has contacted the affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being silenced with technical measures.
In the future, we will continue to engage in an open dialogue with our neighbors.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters deep bath in the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be manufactured here.
“This year, we want to break the 3 million-ton mark on the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, imported coal goes to power plants in the country.
If then the GDF-Suez power plant goes on the grid, well 5 million tons of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloads on the bridge and the second transport band could make up to 10 million.
Baseball players optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can stop us from believing that we can win even against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at Olympiakos Pireus.
We sent the message: there is basketball in Munich too!
At their only third appearance in the European king class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point deficit 13 minutes before the end into a lead before Pireus gave the game a turn again.
“We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made lighthearted mistakes,” said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munichers, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title-bearer Zielona Góra.
10 Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays’ innovation has been expanded, just like last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until at some point they became too famous to perform in a club,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual music and comedy entertainment event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending this year’s festival have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-blowing fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.”
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has grown into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he’s here, then sometimes he’s going through the sidewalk between two buildings and thinking, “Hey, if I lose all my money, then I might live here.
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations
Iran is happy with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear summit with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
“After years, we have now reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clear up the differences of recent years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: boys kill playmates with machete
In Uruguay, two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go hunting birds with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stunned the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw his body into a well, the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
They then played football in a working district in front of their homes.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, whom she had taken with her, was to confess that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The reason for this was, among other things, a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
Custodians must go to prison
For exploiting human trafficking, bullying, threatening, insulting and dangerous bodily injury, the District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two missions in Afghanistan, confessed as part of a trial agreement.
In five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he dismissed after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
The income of the women, which were partly purchased for him for years, he retained.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he blocked women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who instructed the women, he took them to various bordels in the southwest.
There, he had them partly monitored to control their income.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he suffered a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, after an initial report, telephone surveillance measures were able to detect at least four more cases of exploiting human trafficking.
The talks were marked by a high degree of aggression.
In subsequent interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body, has so far failed to make a statement.
It is a “completely broken personality” who considers violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The accused regretted his conduct.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Oil prices continue to fall to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that said China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil range for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning in European e-commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there were indications of stronger demand due to two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108,58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocked Decision on NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Policy
A federal appeal court in the U.S. blocked a judge’s order on Thursday demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk program, and relieved the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal ruled that judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until a city’s appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for arresting and interrogating people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the correctional measures ordered, including the decision to set up a surveillance centre to assist the police in changing their policy and training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid appearance of bias; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including policy reforms, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program of on-body cameras in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing on the city’s appeal is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have existed for decades in various forms, but the number of records of controls recorded during the term of the impartisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, which developed into a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police offices implement the regulation.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would dampen police morale, but not crime; also money would be wasted and the wider problem of a police, which is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade, would not be solved.
The judge pointed out that she does not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reforms the way the NYPD implements controls.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach.
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hände".
On Saturday afternoon we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the association, which can already show considerable success.
The first Chairman Henne in detail about the work of the association.
In 2004, he first visited the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott, Mauritania.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the interventions were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former German border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to work with the association in an advisory role.
In 2008, in a record time of just over a week, the Schleeh Chambery from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a district of poverty on the outskirts of the capital, voluntarily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner, according to chicken, for example, relieving against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this reason many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to mobile goat stall and describing the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians, who traditionally support the club, during their journey to Mauritania.
As his personal motives he referred to his work in the field of accounting as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Furthermore, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
We should not forget that Africa is closer than some people think.
Gran Canaria is not far from Africa.
Coulson Used Phone Hacking to Check a Tips
Former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby’s voicemails and pursued them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“According to the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not someone standing in front of people’s apartments and hoping to catch them on a fresh act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first?
Do you know about phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, “And if he knew about it.”
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editorial when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band of voicemails from their phone from at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective’s computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects.”
While the investigation was ongoing, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice email with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow that I would like to talk about with Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself had an affair with fellow accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
The settlement meeting ended without result.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into an impasse after a failed settlement meeting.
President Francois Hollande welcomed association and association representatives in the Paris Élysée Palace on Thursday and also heard their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was also tough.
The strike, announced for the end of November, will now also be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The matches scheduled between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore out.
Absolute protection is not possible
“We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early,” Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
He said: “The final decisions are made by the municipal council.
The flood, which struck Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighboring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built land as possible is the goal," Häußler said.
It is based on the planning of the protection against a flood that, according to the German Weather Service, is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change will be addressed by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1,000-year flood.
"Absolute protection does not exist, but we can a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to the protection HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros will need to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality counting on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
But Häußler pointed out that the support will only be possible if a comprehensive concept is implemented.
The community depends on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could be started.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm stream from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took the opportunity to express their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retention pools were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who introduced the concept, emphasized that it requires the interaction of all the proposed measures in order to the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, one is considered to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Unrest prevailed among the residents of the old town, who, even in normal storm rains, have repeatedly suffered from a overload of the canal network.
The problem is well known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Häußler, however, pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and this should not be confused.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year rainy events could be covered.
Dimensioning the sewage canals larger would swallow millions.
Heavily injured in collision
Early on Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are various testimony that should be evaluated.
It is stated that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles crashed, with the woman so tightly stuck that it took firefighters almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both victims went to nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a godseeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly, the relative on the outside: the stinking eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive work as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, can be understood, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite valuable in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand endings.
Dick declares America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness, and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God experiences, his late books reading themselves as a mixture from the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He realized early on that computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the blade runner.
That to kill.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is significant now.
The “Minorities Report” dates back to 1956, it streams out the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick’s world, similar to ours, mutants are looking into the future – and the police are attacking.
“We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the agency said.
“We’ll catch them before they can commit a violent crime.”
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a prison camp full of Pesud criminals."
They assume that evil is happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s narrative acts as a blueprint for anti-terror laws and NSA intercepting.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick’s story is not over.
The police chief complains that there is no longer any separation of powers, the military controls everyday life – and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system rotates.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It creates its own conditions.
It does not only buy mistakes and sacrifices, it builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick is about getting closer to the truth.
Talks about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. aftermath of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency Interfax.
Previously, the Greens Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was yesterday the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA Disclosures Increase Corporate Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Foreign Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the U.S. would not use foreign espionage capabilities “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower employee, began to publish his full horn of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to speak.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia over government surveillance to a new high.
The barrel to the overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been stolen, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate executives are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there was no evidence so far that the U.S. had passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the United States.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, we shouldn’t have let it disappear 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction there and is therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after disclosures about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy chief executive, said: “We see a new customer question that didn’t exist a year ago – where is my data stored and can you guarantee it remains physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and they must therefore be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It has always been so.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not boast of the countermeasures taken, as this gives the attackers an advantage.
In large companies, employees have long been insinuated that taking a free USB stick to a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable, to put it mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors at the automaker Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when going abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
Prepaid phones are thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the U.S. National Intelligence estimates in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China among the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of directors of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month with the following words: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
They were represented by important vendors around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has continued.
It starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the often scratched and scratched clothes are closed, often with a veil, in the back, however, they go down the back and often end in a trap.
There, however, the ghosts separate, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes.
In men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of place is important, it is explained.
Unadorned adjacent rooms are not optimal, the atmosphere should be special.
Here, the domain paid attention to its own offer in the remise.
Whoever wants to drive the car has a link for him.
"But cars are also popular for young women's divorces," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "after-wedding photo" - so shoot series in special places, preferably such as waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding dress, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in a stylish way.
Not to forget about proper cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable celebration.
Successful dog friends
Once again, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley he brought it to place twelfth with 87 points.
Susi Höpp with her Woody in Class 1 faced the critical eyes of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled ring mat in his high school gymnasium are convinced that their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a standing mat behind the school hall.
Investigative officers at the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this is something the 17-year-old’s family doubts.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff had concluded.
“They believe it lacks any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, let them be convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their Son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag,” he commented.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts no matter which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died as a result of “position-related suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy found another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that authorities release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video recordings would contain clues about how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a series of guidelines for dealing with children’s food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have stores of epinephrine – the most commonly used auto-injection of the EpiPen brand – in order to face a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states recently changed regulations so that schools can more easily store epinephrine.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is sneezing.”
Parents of intersex children can “choose gender indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer strictly assigned male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “undetermined” or “unspecified” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take away pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for gender allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the flickwork, created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born every year, neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “Sexual Differentiation Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise to use the best available gender allocation information if it is not possible to determine, and not wait for the child’s psychological and physical development before deciding on surgery, if any.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children, that’s not the case,” he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the mystery why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender people because their status is not gender-related but determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These traits were manifested in inferior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender persons are exposed to in their work, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not matching the gender image now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “sexless” person after a court granted a lifetime retention of an “undefined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French parliamentarians from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “gender theory” should be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, arguing: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice, but not sexual activity, then we twist two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Being a parent is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she told the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as Hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine regarded sex as something that can be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical fundamentals of surgery are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they don’t know how the child feels as they grow up with the gender they assign.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency,’” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about treating children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that sex is formable.
He shaped the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental stimuli – like parents raising a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a case known as "John/Joan" in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a circumcision to castrate the child entirely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At age 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, who are “not happy with the outcome.”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should get a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD due to which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
After the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a ‘undefined’,” she said.
We fear it favors intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we do not yet know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she explained.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a battle to be forced by small children at this time.
When you grow up, you can decide on your own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “empowers” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the target cell receptor deficiency for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an associate in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
“The law gives parents room so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parenting.
And you do not have to rush to perform an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This involves children in the decision-making process and eliminates the fear that parents drive because they think they’re not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides which gender is best suited to him – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown woman injured by shooting from car
Unknown persons injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt in a car shooting.
The perpetrators allegedly fired at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening with an air-pressure weapon.
This was by the police in the castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shooting came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The attackers also shot at a bus station.
A cage broke.
Then they drove out of it.
The police investigated, it said on Friday.
Until now, the police inspectorate can look back at Kempten on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to throw eggs on children, who threw them on the facades of the house.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the remains of eggs immediately, no material damage is likely to have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were also set on fire in the city area, but there was no material damage.
A local resident at the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg that his car was wrapped in clamp paper and his wheelchairs were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his wheeled blinds all in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with Future Perspectives
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamfully.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
“You’re hopefully not afraid of spiders?” asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and me for a long time.
You know how hard it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern that in old age you can no longer cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus surgery, the mid-fifty-year-old has had to experience on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, she published a book on the subject "Happy living in old age - Which form of living is best for me?".
“Our apartment is the best example of what doesn’t work in old age,” she begins to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in the mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are ever dealing with the topic of "residence in old age".
Most of them go away as long as they can.
Only the others get old,” she said.
Only when the pressure is really high can you think about it.
“Then it may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 housing models for a self-determined home in old age.
"What kind of housing you choose is always an individual choice," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you can also be united in Dolce Vita,' the author of the book gives expulsion-willing people to consider.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited retirees-WG.
Everyone has their ticks and macks.
“For me, such a housing community would be nothing,” she says with a blinking eye.
It’s not like a student home with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
“At old age, you just need your retreat spaces,” says Ries.
That an elderly residential community can still work, the author does not want to rule out.
However, this has to be done differently than in the classical university.
“Sometimes you just want to be quiet,” she says.
With this view, at least, it is not alone in the state capital.
"Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible," is the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the citizens' service Life in the old age of the state capital.
Their service advises people around the topic of "going older".
That is why older people would often also take up inconveniences and restrictions in order to stay in their usual environment, this is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone who is engaged in the age-appropriate remodeling of their home or apartment first inquire thoroughly and not hire the best craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But not always the existing apartment can be adapted to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the same steeped path to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she fears more than the spider at her door.
US wants to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is accused of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
Therefore, he must face a criminal trial in the United States, said US State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to further threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s statements were statements of a parliamentarian and not of a German government member.
Edward Snowden is ready for talks with German authorities.
But first, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was clarified by the former US-seeked NSA employee in a non-addressed letter published by the Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The letter has the following wording after a translation spread by Ströbele:
to the responsible
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed by contract or through a direct statement as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which prompted me to act out of a moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I found myself exposed to a serious and persistent resentment that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks involved have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the U.S. government, with the support of the international community, will take this detrimental stance.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved, I will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and lawful manner.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Garden Street has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
“The community is satisfied,” Maier emphasizes.
There were 100,000 euros in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen transferred the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and cleaning the sidewalk.
“That effort is now gone,” Mayer rejoices.
Concert at high summer temperatures
The Hammereisenbach Music Club will give a concert on the terrace of the Hammer Guesthouse.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the tap at 7:30 a.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Around 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammricher musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who helped to successfully cope with the first musical shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times has a copy of the book coming out, and it on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to see if Obama's diminishing hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national policy correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly tracks the history of efforts by senior campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the poll values of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential shift was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisors — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe — were aware of the planned change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their "closed, personal relationship" before finally being opposed to such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government has actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I stated a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One must remember that the president at the time had terrible poll scores, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as “due diligence,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out if such a train would pay off in terms of the polls.
“Campaigns don’t spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think about something seriously,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he does not believe the president was “aware” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political surveys had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the go?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail technically similar to that of conventional mail?
In the conception of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not provide a stable foundation for an audible correspondence exchange.
Therefore, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
When the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional emails being read on their way through the network?
Most emails are read several times on the go by software robots.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the recipient systems.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is an annoying and undesirable spam email, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems like Gmail, the robot also collects the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming vacation trip, Google can hide corresponding links to vacation offers.
Do unfamiliar people read emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely low.
In theory, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or access emails.
This includes possible illegal spying activities.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize without delay who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market?
In the mainly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role, according to a study conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had last fallen, Gmail from Google was able to increase significantly.
Mother in the forest and receiving pensions
When his sick mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care.
In order to continue to collect pensions and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First, he hid the death of the 89-year-old, then he stole the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be held accountable for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, it became clear that no more medicines were needed for the caring mother.
The retiree told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he last cared for them.
The 67-year-old acknowledged the death of his mother.
According to the police, the autopsy did not reveal any evidence of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice that shines in the dark – using strawberries.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a glowing delight.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on pineapples and managed to convince Chinese scientists to artificially make the glowing protein.
When eaten, the ice cream reacts with the tongue, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the lightening.
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – so the more you lick, the lighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal for us to put it on the market on Halloween because it has that wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the light bulb is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I’d like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in itself impossible due to the light breakage caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qualla, which is artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
The TSV Morsum is still without any points in the handball league after six days of play.
It is now for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to the derby against the TSV Daverden, who last weekend celebrated his first victory.
This game starts the season for us.
"I hope that we finally have the head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
He has finally, with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme, his entire squad at his disposal.
As we do, we also play on speed.
We need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a sure impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number.
But that’s why we’re not far from being the favourite, because anything can happen in a derby.
However, Panitz now wants to move to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
To this end, the A-Jugendliche Joost Windßuß, who is active with double play rights at the A-Jugend Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in this game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
I have become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will probably not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I’m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Retail Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trends.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year exciting uninhabited objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I’m expecting a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Space Men will get it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I think there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
There are a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we are not obsessive.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, sweets, candy and rubber berries.
So good news for the 41 million people who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, travel through the neighborhoods with the phrase “sweet or sour.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don’t mind – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar-sweetened Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold on Halloween, according to the National Confectionery Association.
That’s about nine billion corn grains.
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it spits.
They have great names like “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognised spy houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos you’re putting yourself in your pants and then posting your friends on Facebook where you don’t get rid of them again, and one then the guy you’re standing on leaves a comment like “good facial expression.”
Finally, let’s get to the cockroaches.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Turmeric when we were children, and cutting a turmeric lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we’ve been doing since childhood.
Fortunately, the “baby in turmeric” trend didn’t start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the turmeric and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on strawberries, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The turmeric lamp, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of turmeric were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and grab something gorgeous out of their 921-pound turmeric.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: rescuers find carbonized bodies
Firefighters arrived in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
Rescue workers pulled a dead body out of the house.
Rescuers have found a dead body in a fire in Helmbrechts in a three-family house.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday night it burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames were already blowing out of a window.
The officers went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive campaign to promote the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of parishioners: the Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For today’s young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day schedule yourself.
For the first time, the Landeskirche has commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of declassification: “God’s voice is silent, the world is loud.”
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and can set my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well out of it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for this theologians would have a secure employer.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not only concerned with careers, but with meaningful work.
According to the state church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors retire annually.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariat.
In thinly populated peripherals such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may become difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people, among other things, and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.

Firefighters called to rescue a puppy who stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rockfront in a rockfall
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby escaped after a minor car accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a rockfall in her nauseous position.
Firefighters sailed off the rock wall and saved the dog from a sure death
The firefighters managed to safeguard a puppy who was stuck on a 15 meter high front in a rock wall.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel dog, escaped a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a crash on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the stonefall Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back in and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought for their missing dog and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped into the crash after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high tail in the rockfall.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to the spot and sailed to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she is well.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
It was a rather unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team’s specialist, said: “Ruby had a huge luck.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “To see the rescue was frightening.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold them back in my arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never played Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard" as a background singer.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker, and that “he stunned me when I was 18.”
She added, “That’s been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a 70-year-old Jaggers representative said on Thursday that he “catastrophically denies that he has ever made approaches to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album “Prism” reached first place this week.
George Kerevan: Separation of Europe gives Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
That provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often turn their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be just a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots.
Actually no story.
And one that has already come so in the years that it already looks like a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” phrase at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the crisis of the euro, the project Europe has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro as a common currency overboard are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to raise almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the compulsory jacket into which the respective national economies are forced by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that happen.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin.
Behind the current tax and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All of the world’s wage regulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is stirring up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to raise Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy, with which the stricken French economy has to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus put the ruling Socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes – a timely warning to the UK Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the working-class white French?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point to which I want to go: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of cuddling with the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can choose to be a region of (in the last consequence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which also includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide.
I suspect that Scotland could do well in a looser European union if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalizing it to Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and carried out) cuts blamed on Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to get an austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing up faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more likely than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is coming soon,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and arm hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarca (the onset of the first menstrual bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years until the menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is considered “early maturity” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests by an endocrinologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained about drugs, but he admits, “Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls being different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” remembers a woman whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys come into puberty earlier than girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine that established a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more likely than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and skull hair earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shy hair is common even in babies and young children.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called this week for an industry standard that would require a seat width of at least 46 centimeters (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says that should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the November 17-21 event.
The design of the rear of the aircraft – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” can accommodate 406 people in the tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share hints about technical details through advertising in the specialized press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company posted an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, titled, “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbochargers,” said Airbus chief sales officer John Leahy.
Faced with changing eating habits, people are becoming fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by ten percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
The average American male waist circumference in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly named “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, research has shown that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’s seat size figures and says it’s not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance flight rates and furnishings.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience in the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” explains Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it’s about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it’s increasingly becoming a matter that can impact sales.
The dispute is behind a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion in list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the U.S. or European export balance sheet.
As Reuters first in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat on their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements about the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 7777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with the machines currently in use with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore pressing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive for our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers chose the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper flight rates.
“Eighteen-inch seat widths would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat of the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin design expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers that airlines can choose from.
The world traveling jet vendors even carry band size with them to measure the furniture in the competition.
Even if they value comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-compressed jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered wide seats in the hallways for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fade away, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Disrupt Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests on humans are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains an innocuous virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice who were given nicotineined their normal activity levels.
Non-vaccinated mice, on the other hand, would have taken a “outtime,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine has reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
Most likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
“You know that when you start smoking again, you don’t feel any pleasure with the nicotine vaccine, and that helps you get rid of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the State Corruption Inspectorate.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the regulations on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three land on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various ministers to renew lease agreements on Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now being investigated over the allegation that Tripodi was aware of Obeid's hidden interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The dealers were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the rental contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which contributed $2.5 million annually to the Obeids, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially voted in favour of public tenders.
But he denies making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the government’s lease arrangements.
One telegraph submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had shifted to the Port Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these telephone talks the development of commercial lease arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” replied Tripodi.
I do not remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets strike targets in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign Workers With 457 Visa Could Be Submitted to 'Authentification Test'
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If the test is introduced, it would be used over a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was released after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Hudging statements like ‘foreigners should be in the back’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant regression at a time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region heard an echo of this historic artifact, I’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who attended talks on human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the “authenticity criterion” is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be verified for the “authenticity of the application in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the owner or any relevant person of the supporting company.”
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s disturbed nine-year-old son, who had come to Australia with him, has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
The man was taken to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed highway between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for additional route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network of routes that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings huge advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to “unambiguously” advocate Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time it also provides the economic strength of Scotland with an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That’s why we are delighted to work as a partner of the UK government and explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government already plans.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly decide on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia temporarily
Australian airline passengers are still required to turn off tablets and smartphones at takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their regulations so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases as long as they are in “Flight Mode”.
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when taking off and landing.
Australian airlines are watching the decision, which requires U.S. airlines to do a lot of work to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would review the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases remain in place in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it said.
The matter is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by the cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and stated that it is open to changes, but they need to be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it will continue to comply with current regulations.
“Our current policies stipulate that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when taking off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand-luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when taking off and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB supporters with light rackets had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund has suffered severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between German vice-meister Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Mostly the guests were listening to their songs.
The southern tribune, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, presented itself exceptionally quietly at first: no chants, no strikes.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinated the joint incineration, remained unoccupied.
And in front of the tribune there was a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Prohibition".
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the pitch as always as the first BVB player, a short-term joy burned up.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and blowing shouts - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Tribune, nothing moved.
Even that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration.
Only five minutes before the kick-off, the capo climbed his podium – and the tensions that could be felt with hands until then dissipated in a loud scream, as Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood in the ranks in the stadium.
Finally, as always, it was the Southern Tribune – and finally, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger steht auf" came from the southern tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB supporters who had travelled with them had fired light rackets into the audience tracks and to the square - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from having a choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.
“I have forbidden it,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
“It’s going to be cutting down,” assured Watzke.
It is interesting to see how the reactions will be on the Southern Tribune.
Pension houses boom in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pantry at the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 a month as an administrative employee and her husband is also working, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third hedge house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as inexpensive as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands from a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
But mortgages offer the advantage that there is no credit check or proof of income required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to mortgages after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser fiscal policy in the developed economies, lower- and middle-income families are looking for mortgages to offset the gap in a staggering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's described rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt ratio to GDP in Asia, according to the agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segments (income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further reinforced the tendency to pledge personal belongings as people take advantage of the opportunity to convert family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city state’s 200 pledges are gold.
People say to themselves, “The price of gold looks good, let’s pledge grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
Thailand’s largest mortgage operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20-percent customer growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates its subsidiaries in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company funds it with 60 percent of the $66 million Singapore dollar it raised this week with its opening in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“Customers borrow items they already own, and liquidating personal valuables does not increase household education,” she explains.
The business of collateral loans is increasingly accepted by society as a short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come from every social layer.
“These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small who need to bridge gaps in cash flow,” Yeah says.
Sometimes you just need money very quickly.
NSA seizes data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants help
Intelligence agent Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany uncover the ever-broken NSA spy affair.
According to the representative of the Greens, Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify before a German public prosecutor’s office or an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue Package Over 325 Million Australian Dollars for Tasmanian Healthcare
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the $325 million Australian bailout package for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government can’t waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avoid a crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic impairments.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election services.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic procedures and treatment for gray star, are aimed at removing residues.
In addition, there is funding for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-patient care, specialist medical training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas concerned clinical staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state would have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election outcomes will largely compete with recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today’s announcement is just a “plaster solution.”
"We are in the present situation because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth puts 300 million into it and then pretends it’s good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, the plot tells the captivating story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
As she revolts, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of the erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides into lust or sensational lust – and that’s the problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormentary shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and poison gas ammunition, the global chemical weapons surveillance group said on Thursday, as severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where presumed toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed almost three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date of the meeting.
November 1, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set to destroy or make “inoperable” all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poisonous gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which essentially represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and warehouses, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll in Syria through a network of activists, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Among them, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad’s army, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the death toll in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give any details.
The fighting underscores the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors as their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous weapons arsenal is a race against time amidst a tumultuous civil war.
According to OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all of Syria’s key production and mixing facilities.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit to two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been “abandoned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there have been moved to other mentioned facilities that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat for the courage and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission this organization has ever carried out,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the monitoring organization’s general director, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the predominantly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against the Assad government and its security forces, many of whom are members of the Alawites, to separate Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 Bali bomb attack reacted indignantly to the verdict for the last of the instigators brought to court, as Umar Patek, in their opinion, should be shot by law.
Patek, who was on the run for a decade as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder in connection with the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded many more.
A conviction was also made in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded life imprisonment, even though it could have requested the death penalty for the man, also referred to as “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bombmaker.
The decision has raised painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the feeling that I will never have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was grounded when, on October 12, 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a small loader parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23:00.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy should get the death penalty first of all.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to face trial.
He escaped a decade of arrest, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he had shown no regret for how much suffering he had done to other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is committed with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but not make mobile calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to read, work, play, music, and watch movies, but not make phone calls, according to new guidelines issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they will be implemented will depend on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight personnel training manuals and equipment storage regulations in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are only allowed to restart them when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and may not start again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secure against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even when taking off, landing, and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been redesigned to use Wi-Fi at larger altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight crew, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline on this – it will benefit both sides,” Glading said.
We are honestly tired of having to feel like guardians on this subject.
Nevertheless, internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends,” the scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he publicly had to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight deck.
And heavier devices such as laptops will still need to be stored, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phones during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert, told CBS News that phones would still be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause interference to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with broadcasters,” Rosenker said.
A industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri have argued that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to one-third of passengers forget to turn off the device or ignore it.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966, after reports of interference of navigation and communication devices by passenger-powered UKW radios became known, which represented the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to avoid electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only emits minimal radiation when you switch.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Among the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees called a passenger plane full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not find any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the failure caused by the devices is real, even though the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only isolated reports of pilots speaking in favour of interference with aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the devices when instruments land in poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird rescued by North Sea-Bohrinsel air rescue service
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into the wild.
The water rally was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rally was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added, “He couldn’t fly further, which is why we were contacted with a request for help.”
When they were released, the water rally was back fit and healthy.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
For this purpose, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives depicting UK corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnant.
They want the government to favor new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of stopping the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked for their views on certain regulated issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders are of the opinion that control over these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies said the cost of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the one that is traditionally most European-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says the most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a significant majority would like Britain to take a course towards changing the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring the handbook of action back to the UK.
A change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly needed as the Eurozone is now moving towards a tighter economic and fiscal union.
Employment and growth in the UK must be the priority, as the results of our survey show, which means increased focus on trade for companies and a fundamental change in Brussels’ approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s board of directors said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide more diversity in Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries on the planned route should begin at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed with an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For domestic and international investors, there is no way past the property location of Germany.
The economic framework data is correct, and the financing opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in European comparison.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
How sought-after German commercial properties are, shows the look at the transaction volume, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, while in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA is easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices on airplanes – even though phone calling remains prohibited.

Royal Commission Hearing: Two YMCA Employees Accused of Sexual Offences Against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with child-related sexual offenses before charges against Caringbah’s childcare provider Jonathan Lord were filed in 2011, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children in the organization.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned on one case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 for abusing children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but did not know of the second.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in stating that “there were external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognized as at the forefront of child safety.”
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at 21 at YMCA, admitted that management failed “from me down” in hiring Lord and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of parental safety guidelines.
Lord was convicted of sexual assault on 12 boys during his two-year YMCA service earlier this year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denies that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of children’s safety.
The staff said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, taking care of her privately as a babysitter, letting her sit on his knee, telling one that he loved it, and letting children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child care director Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervisor of Lords at YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very inaccessible.”
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they would not have it to him.
Hare explained that he communicated to the board of YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organization has to draw from the “Jonathan-Lord incident” is “not about the reporting” by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations appeared was made by YMCA’s Executive Director of Children’s Services, Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent contamination of evidence, but that it was “excessively” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse of children, told the commission.
He explained that there were “serious problems” with the recruitment, review, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British prime minister, but admitted that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Middle East Peacekeepers Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard with the words: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horseshow experts gathered in crowds in Cardiff to win the Horse of the Year, they were aware that a tough competition was ahead.
But nobody was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who aren’t even in kindergarten yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee rolled through the three rounds loosely and picked up the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both equally tall, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate hat in a freaky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that are far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top scores for his appearance and personality.
Fenton received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland Pony every day since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and toffee are a great mix.”
They had to compete against the entire field and left the field with the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Absolutely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over a decade.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electrified, and everybody sparked him and kicked him.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
Just as he started, it won’t take long for him to be on the “Horse of the Year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they beat each other and performed in the run.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Guide – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s sweet clothes helped their part, which really suited perfectly to the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed”
A Chinese newspaper that called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on its front page should be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based Neue Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he took bribery money to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now the Neue Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulatory authority said.
The “rectification order” was issued by the Office of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that Neue Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several false reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly,” the regulatory authority said in a statement.
She said it was decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, “The Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to do a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant responsible persons at the New Express and to immediately review the New Express’ management team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he alleged financial irregularities at a building machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he published false reports for payment.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I acted wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that it failed to correctly check the reports.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a law change earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Drugs tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 120-inch tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found.
The Zickzack tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unidentified, the authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers have been charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences of between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing the drug cartel the challenge of how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 640-meter long railway passage from a kitchen in a Tijuana residential building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still in love
Actors Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr will be separating in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said, however, that he and Kerr are still in love.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has announced his divorce from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we planned or hoped.”
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
“We will support and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs significantly from vegetarianism.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream, or a strong edamer, these slems are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan refuses all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but when looking closer, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable inventiveness.
“Brotaupstarts are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "in 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"But the belief came not just because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday affairs can also be done without animal products.
Being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of vegans, which extends to the overall consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning after hamburgers, roasted eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact being a vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, but it's an enrichment."The assumption that changing the diet reduces the choice of food options leads Proctor more likely to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions that have failed some of the even so well-intentioned attempts.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that causes many to quit quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor compares.
And say, “Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For a barbecue party, Proctor brings, for example, Aubergines, champignons and also a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste delicious.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, that’s legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread belief, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased amount of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are excellent, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, the lack of vitamin B12 warns many vegansimus critics.
“Because animals are fed with feed instead of grass on grass, it’s questionable whether the meat you buy in the refrigerator is high in vitamin B12,” says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 levels are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go a long way for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need can be found on site.
Sometimes I buy something special.
“Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so is the case with ‘ordinary’ finished products as well.”
Nevertheless, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small slices you can good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonate instead of eggs, with his vegan cheese cake, Proctor was able to astonish his father-in-law too.
Family parties give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has also been raised.
Do you not taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions one must act as a vegan with a fingertips feeling.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to be an enclave.
Looking closer, the everyday world does not appear as vegan as it is thought - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as is generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are pommes everywhere.
“Many diner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he turns away from pastry dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting into it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can figure out a development: "You have to talk to people, make them notice."
"When enough requests come in, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others,” says Proctor.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make most of it impossible from the outset,” Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when one learns to understand that even in peanuts can contain animal additives as a coloring agent, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only this is why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food and also cleaning products.
“You gradually develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos to pay attention to “Sometimes it’s better to take small steps than staying or stumbling,” says Proctor.
Veganism is an important moral fingerprint that strikes on awareness.
He may not be able to completely get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers at ease.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon.
In a statement, the operator claimed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breaks in the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq index had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transportation.
In August this year, there were two breaks in one week alone.
At first, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and cancel orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading went silent for several hours due to a computer breakdown at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook’s stock exchange went up.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of buy-and-sale orders, the stock exchange regulator SEC later determined, tormenting the company to a record $10 million fine.
Radler kills 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 22:00, on a female bicycle was on an irregular way on the left side of the walkway from the station square towards Marketstätte.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped out of a local walkway, the cyclist could no longer brake on time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a about 15 centimeters long square wound on the head.
A rescue team brought the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police order Assange to be extradited
British police today handed over an extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been sent a “call to stand,” urging him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he could be arrested.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on charges of a sexual offence after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “delivered an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time of our choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for allegations of espionage after he posted more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Drivers who drove 210 km/h with hot drinks between their legs will be fined £1,000
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the District Court of Colchester, Howie pleaded guilty to failing the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a £90 fee and a £100 sacrifice fee.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally reviewed the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on houses that cost more than £2 million in the 2012 budget, as well as annual fees for buyers who own houses as a company and not as individuals.
As of now, revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeds revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said, “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced homes and the introduction of related anti-evading legislation, it’s hard to claim that high-quality properties are taxed too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant when it comes to buying real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market in terms of price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, were priced at a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6 per cent, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) experienced an upward trend, according to a Savills survey.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail twitching and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail waved more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs were on the left side.
But now scientists say other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “It is well known that in humans, the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to their peers’ lateral tail swing, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these other dogs’ films.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the tail’s movement more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a otherwise expressive dog moving its tail to the right (see from the perspective of the wretched dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail healing was mostly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog who wedles), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Instead, he is convinced that the dogs learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said, “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wagging with your tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react based on those experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their pet’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert and guest fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, it was stated that “dogs are more likely to turn to a robot dog when its ‘tail’ swings to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming upset – exactly the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the differences may be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is substantial evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can simply be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Arctic Monkeys have postponed a concert in Glasgow after their lead singer suffered from laryngitis.
The band from Sheffield is scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has been postponed.
The announcement came after the band had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis, which is why he may not appear, unfortunately."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was postponed to November 21 at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the point of sale where you purchased your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so Francis will thereby appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, will take place.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have dropped by February.
He explained that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as needed to get the number of eligible cardinals back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The consistory next year is therefore significant because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
Currently, there is a certain overlap on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “very possible” that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation until now – it’s all new.
Valero said that typically bishops from large places are called to be cardinals, but Francis is “filled with surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair seat seats
General Motors is recalling 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks from 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority said on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for the backing of the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety with head supports.
“If you get on the vehicle from the back, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the passengers, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the news read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the leading U.S. automaker’s most important model launch since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notice letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperate scream of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
Blockade policy doesn’t excuse Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book I thought would excite me during the sad second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts Barack Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish with my patient subtitles in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take the breath of a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers stopped to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried out of joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82% of the votes.
Then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, like being ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember those optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the passing of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also think that the party-political blockade tactic has driven too many efforts to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to an end with my attempts to explain it.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why one allows the interrogation of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers who disclose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits were bypassed during the presidential election.
It doesn’t justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it can’t excuse the inability to design a simple website for the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don’t know if that’s what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the government’s work could contradict its predecessor political campaigns.
Obviously, the House of Representatives is not a predictable course as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown Massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, it seems that they are largely chosen by the government itself.
That disturbs me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012 not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and untouched alternative, he seemed unable to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of upcoming elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of so long ago.
But with the approval rates for Obama falling below 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become even harder.
It arouses in me the longing for the many promises that have broken up in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama suffered a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania presidential election.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It’s five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn’t agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest with his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute over paying $6 million in carbon tax, filed the claim as he wanted to wipe out questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes should be abolished or cut.
But Palmer argued that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine-Coast headquarters of Fairfax with 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it can be done faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you go in, enter the data in a computer, choose immediately, and then get the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, using a pencil is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently released a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy is to have an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new post “very seriously.”
A public office is a service to the public.
“We seek no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide government investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly starting.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with authorities in investigating the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes ownership every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank transaction has brought about.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigations on this matter are ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation that RBS had forwarded records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been licensed from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was fired this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it took action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory agency Finma stated that it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks are alleged to have arranged in transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks scratch instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks means that “you can influence the market with very low ticket prices.”
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the dealer acted on his own and that the matter is restrained,” Credit Suisse said.
The building fence painted on the Bechtle groundpiece
A group of citizens’ initiative “Swiss Wheat” has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and spread the pedestrian path, it is said in a press release.
The planned covering of the falling house in the back of the plot was not allowed for security reasons, as the terrain threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the embellishment operation with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the BI’s action, a transparent with the message “We are for” was attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was “We are against building ruins.”
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss lawn - should the giant project one day fail.
In the conversation with many passers in front of the "site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will go better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying those responses, the BI says.
As you can see, the public statements of the mayor also impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he was concerned that the thermal bath would be used if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss lawn.
Some appear to be quite frightened because of this, others feel it as a "plump blackmail attempt" on the population, the BI said in a press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane not a Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high shape of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bullen" showed himself from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he said on Thursday at a news conference in Salzburg.
Recent cause for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese was destroyed by an alleged acting - which, of course, was not, as the TV images showed.
"A cruel mistake," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot with determination: "I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself says he did not have any contact with his colleague after the scharmützl with Hütter.
I would not know why.
"Because I was the one who was offended," the 46-year-old emphasized.
In the face of the success, Rangnick voted a hymn of praise.
“There are only two words for this: very good,” he said.
There is not much to postpone.
The way the team plays is impressive.
Let it continue so calmly.
There will be little change in the winter transfer period.
There are no good reasons to change anything.
“Unless a player comes up with the desire to leave the club,” Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Health Act
It is a big victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five-to-four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to contract health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional within the state’s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts fought on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy voted against.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and also held that the Health Act’s provision that states should either extend access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state funding for Medicaid is not constitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 presidential campaign.
Norway: A Norwegian place is shining with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian town have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low rate of sunrise, the Rjukan in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
“Finally!” said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley put on sunbeds, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Previously, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the project worth 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has given the Italian alpine town of Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Post less on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes in the city centre and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is empty.
Whether Hofheim and Rosengarten will also be empty on Sunday will not be answered in the response to the FDP’s request.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service.
This undermines this undertaking radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters in January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Party’s group and city association, supports his group colleagues: “What annoys me is the fact that here the school hours are secretly changed or abolished.”
The post office is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts must be empty again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
It also applies to the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
There is also a Sunday vacation in Hofheim.
The party is in favour of privatization.
“Then decisions are made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Parking fees in Frankfurt will rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be considerably more expensive.
The magistrate of the city is debating this morning on a proposal by transport dezerrent Stefan Majer (Greens).
Parking fees will be increased by 50%.
For this, however, the prices are not to be raised, but the time interval of parks and parking machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this “not a good idea”.
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Transport Club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "completely appropriate and in fact long overdue."
Public transportation will also become more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Rapid actions overwhelm hosts
With a narrow squad, the men of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbischen Alb in the Schiller-Schulturhall in Reutlingen.
The elders stood on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
But soon it turned out that, even due to their age, they could not fully cope with the quick actions of the Joy City.
With the hard and placed upheavals, the favors were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clearly through the center of the net and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of the Joy City in all matters.
In the face of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat lazy and reluctant to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
Then on 2 November, with TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly establish itself in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt met in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They played a tough two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mistakes and points, especially when taking the ball; even with the passes, precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical game scenes, the overwhelmer prevented the sight of possible points gains.
In this highly balanced encounter in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, however, the great physical effort and a pleasant engagement of both teams was consistent.
At the Little English Cottage
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut off on this day in the area of the cottage, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, referred to this area as the glory of the canyon slope, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the Care Day is a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to place accents in nature itself.
Along with the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Government Presidium following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view coincides with the goal of preserving the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting with the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for animal conservation.
Tribukait said she does not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
In this planning, the current measure is not just seamlessly integrated.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous supplementation of what was achieved with the Life project and the past care days for the future.
Following these different statements, District Manager Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the assistants into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, and the forest cutting machine could be ready to be recovered.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of Wacholder bushes and the care of a dry stone rod.
The goal was free view at the point of view.
Löfingen: Köpfler remains the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban works can be described as an attractive city, so far no second mayor candidate has applied.
As the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer candidate for reasons of age, the 46-year-old bank merchant and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been established.
The application deadline ends on Monday, November 11, at 18:00.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, tightened a lava of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company overbought by it in Nortel’s bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with seven patent infringements.
The patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google filed an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After being overbought by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Al Google failed in its attempt to acquire the lawsuits at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent violation was intentional, according to the indictment.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Morsi is leaving office, but his day of triumph is not expected to mark the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months earlier.
With his admission to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore the oath before the 18 black-dressed judges of the court, which is located on the Nile and imitates an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been mostly targeted as a banned organization by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to praise the new president, and unlike the presidential glamour of Mubarak's time, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy could cross the usual busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Being mocked by the uncharismatic “replace wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to target the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden chamber where he served.
Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was scheduled to deliver his opening speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in a standstill.
Military Chief Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university’s largest auditorium with choirs of “The army and the people are one hand”.
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo has grown into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi swore a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers the military council had taken from the outcast head of state.
But by swearing the official oath in court and not as usual in parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two wonderful evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", and tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25-party.
Fatty beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers, of course, on both days.
Employee falls from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a faulty external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and seriously injured himself on Thursday.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guesthouse.
When he climbed the staircase, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was transported to the Salzburg State Hospital by helicopter "Christophorus 6".
South African rapist sentenced to life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced twice to life sentences on Friday.
This was by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The incident caused horror across the country.
The 21-year-old then raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for 14 hours for the victim’s survival, but in vain.
The sight of the youth was so terrible that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booys in the night of the crime.
He also admitted to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl’s death.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from jail because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: about 64,000 sexual assaults are every year.
That’s almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has a significantly greater population than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure for sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest
Jumbo in search of the "best shark in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star attended Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the shink is the pork cows, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can the shingles you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the large shinking factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
“Germany’s favorite snake,” as Jumbo announces the Schwarzwälder snake.
Only with hair protector and boiler comes it inside the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can access the microphone.
Jumbo for reinforcement at Fastimbiss in Waldshut
"Here I am working in huge quantities," the television makers are amazed, Schwarzwälder Schinken as a mass product.
16,000 columns a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat proportion, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months of age.
Television on level?
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
“I’m looking forward to seeing Roberto Blanco measure what happens,” Jumbo said cynically.
Here is the level of private television in pure culture.
But it is worth watching anyway.
The viewer sees that breaking down the columns is still handwork.
Schwarzwälder Schinken is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of shinking is the mixture of spices with salt.
The smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: Tanned branches provide here in the smoke for the special taste of the Black Forest shink.
After 20 days in smoke, the shink is almost black.
"Now the disc is disappearing in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
“It’s really delicious,” concluded the TV star.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the entire year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an annual adjusted profit before taxes between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011-12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre a profit of 8 percent in the first half of the year and a strong start to the second half, in Australian and British private.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on track toward record-year revenue before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest earner countries.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, resulting in a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, it went well for Flight Centre’s leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the whole year is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools will be pushed to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will be required to cover at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poem, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “unseen texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students are required to take an independent GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for audits, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public trust,” emphasizing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, ambitious and strict.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, coalition circles say the comprehensive math examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in the ranking lists – will likely encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum puts more emphasis on “real-life issues,” including financial mathematics.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented this weekend in the City Hall.
The assessments were made on Thursday.
Again, the local association W514 organizes this great exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the Soest district show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobby owners show their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals in the cages is appropriate.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 14.30.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 a.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 15 a.m., with the winning ceremony following.
Guests are also invited to a Tombola equipped with remarkable prices and a deliciously equipped cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and appears for the first time with a new bubblehead.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum
The next Ecumenical Talk Forum will be held on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle on the theme “To Hell with Hell – Theological Reflections on Today’s Dealing with the Last Things”.
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Palace of Salem and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the forum the question of how people today rank the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had put themselves on those images of heaven and hell that “shape our conceptions to this day,” the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for fulfillment would rather be characterized by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by Christians due to the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the outcry marks."
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the irritation of death.”
This is connected with the question of that longing, "who dreams that at the end everything will be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated in 1997 to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg confirm their faith at the firmament
In two worship services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were affirmed.
The liturgy was accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
By receiving the sacrament of the firmament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past few months, the firmaments had prepared for the great feast day under the leadership of the deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the congregation.
In various projects, they learned about different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day together in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is stated by Ulrich Knobel of the organising Sportverein Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters above the altitude, were also numerous everybody cyclists who wanted to exercise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placement at the German championships.
Both were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small time advance to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place was Pascal Treubel.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli of Team Nightmare who managed to reach the top of the winning ladder.
Second and third were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
Also, the age structure ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest startups.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to step down from the top regional drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, along with a team colleague, has already been world champion twice in the 12-hour ride.
This year he became European champion in this specialty.
Roland Ballerstedt has already won two German duathlon championships.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a wimpering final in the finish in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl crashed first over the finish line.
Only a second behind, the routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were third in the overall rating.
In the women's rating, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and assistants were very pleased with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
Travelling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as “CNN Hero of the Year.”
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.
In the United States, there are 413 doctors per person.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons’t be able to afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffered made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive over unfortified terrain to the villages in need of help with the encircled medical equipment on the roof.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push their vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be received like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his wide smile and boundless energy – is happy to be there for the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team then starts examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a range of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crows, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the rest area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is powered by the group’s generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exhausting curriculum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries over the past year and knows that their work is making a huge difference for the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery of a spleen fracture he received now allows him to work again.
“This will change the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in her second year and volunteers for Bwelle’s group.
He’s always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on those campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgeries where we help drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a second year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitary supplies.
Once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over accommodation, transportation and guidance.
“He is undoubtedly a hero,” O’Malley said.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his Father brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on Horst Janson's body.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his craft, the acting arts.
The old man Santiago can’t be offended when fishing.
The two complement each other greatly.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the old man’s neck, of which the young fisherman Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits on the chair, tired of life, it’s real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson mastered excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on stage as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues will not be boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea is made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann sets the old man in a boat outside the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he brings to light the active scene: The Cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who with her songs and her magnificent voice sings the feeling of life in Cuba.
The four musicians play the rhythm of Cuba and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage canal from the Roman era is preserved beneath Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne do not pass by the cathedral.
The two towers are about 157 meters high, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who admire the two filigrane church towers know that there is also a lot to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne Underground.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly on the Cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: “We start in the underground garage,” says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-right city, and therefore, from the remains of the old city wall, only what was not too large remained.
Most users of the parking lot are therefore rushing past the Roman remains today and just parking their car.
But if you look closer, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars on the park deck D2.
You can see roughly five meters high ruins of hand-sized stones.
"These are the remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," Schulze says.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper floor of the park take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shale.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants climb back down into the depth.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor would like to know.
The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "City of Roman right and City of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the pretorium is the former governor's palace, the power centre of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the lobby of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage canal, which isined here at about 120 meters in length.
“You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want,” Schulze pleases the guests.
There is a surprise for Schultz.
After picking up the key at the treasury, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shade.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction works are expected to begin soon.
However, there will be a few years until completion.
Leg Almost Cut off: Re-release of the Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rock environment is rolled up again after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous bodily injury and material injury against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused remain silent.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
The prosecutors accused them of stopping and beating three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are believed to be members of the rival group Hells Angels.
One of them was a senior member from Berlin.
It appeared to have been preceded by a pursuit of several cars.
According to the accusation, it was a field fight and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and were not identified.
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the judgment after a review by the Public Prosecutor’s Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for further hearing.
One of the accused is currently under public execution for another offence.
The initiative was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the act.
As a witness, the Investigative Commissioner was called.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the accused and other persons who had been interrogated by the police.
The hard thing is that rocker in court almost always adheres to a law that is fair to them - and does not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had packed out.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
Another 11 days of negotiations are scheduled.
The company does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
In the bushes of the passengers on the passenger and rear seats, hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or another cocktail or cocktail may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than chilling to the next drive-in to give yourself a little?
I admit, I like to be involved when it comes to fast food picking late at night or early in the morning.
A couple of chips, a cola, a burger – and then nothing like going home and to bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs become noticeable.
What does it mean to throw fast food bags out of the car window?
Especially on weekends, paper bags are thrown away on the outskirts of the streets and on parking spaces.
“Why?” I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next garbage dump?
It’s not just the paper stuff that spoils the landscape.
Bags have also already covered transport facilities such as steering boards and thus triggered accidents.
About this thought said "Wegwerfgesellschaft" but not after, probably she doesn't even know what this word really means.
If you are on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage turmoil there.
There would be a few bags more or less of no importance - unlike the street, where no one wants to tramp on the food remains of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and municipalities will become too foolish to move away - and the fast food chains will have to demand bail for their bags.
Obama's Retreat in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday made a retreat to his often repeated, unambiguous promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the redundancies, Obama urged those Americans who have received such reports to look around for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“You’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government called it not surprising that the five percent of the population who have signed an insurance themselves would have to look around for a different tariff because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans very directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said in a hearing in the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an upset Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s House hearing was recorded after a dispute with Missouri Republican MP Billy Long.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed with the question why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-sponsored insurance in order to conclude a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem Government Not Confirming Attack on Syrian Air Base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, a day earlier.
The targets were "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot in the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, which showed Russian defense missiles of the type S-125 Newa, as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters quoted a similarly anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has gone “unreasonably far too far”
With an unexpected acknowledgment, John Kerry pointed to a weakening of the U.S. deterrent on its surveillance programs, saying that in certain cases, espionage has "goed inappropriately too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
The leaked information has plunged the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a video-transmitted speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the president and I, as well as others in the government, have heard of some things that have gone by quasi-autopilot, simply because the ability to do this was back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course to September 11.”
He later acknowledged as the first senior member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage has crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The president is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, “We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is aimed at killing people, blowing up, and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in anti-terrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and is chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA has monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and stated that this is common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing for the congressional trip to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being prepared.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also spoke that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A stubborn injury to the shoulder joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga outside game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is looking for a move from Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
Until now, it has only been done individually.
"We will decide on his engagement in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeeper with six goals.
Because the Mainz have already to give up on the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for making a false testimony after reporting to Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, footage from a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until they admitted to having invented the story.
Until the trial she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in an adult female prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubgy League player who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back to Australia.
“Of course, we are very concerned, but we hope she is back home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and is on free ground against a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is on vacation in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also result in a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent assassination of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, may have been trying to improve its damaged tourist image and therefore come to an acquittal.
