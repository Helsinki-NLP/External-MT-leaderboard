The UKIP demons who reject people living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for people coming to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with thinly veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to stand in line behind chronic hypochondriac intolerants who think they owe it all to them.
I think you're the one using the special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing lunatics, is virtually non-existent.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel is not evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger then.
The Mail didn't write the report, they just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You also know nothing about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's statement surprised many, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get over it.
I'm not sure where you're coming from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media talks about something you don't like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcherite followers who think that AIDS and floods are a sign from God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that humanity's complexities are a good thing, then no.
In the end, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the austerity period will not have fixed anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was the 'TIGER OF EUROPE' we were bragging about a few years ago.
We've seen the rest!
I recommend you read the article.
Ireland is being made to look like a virtuous country and a 'new economic miracle' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible working schedule, continued emigration.
With these ingredients, there is no 'paving' for the time being with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal.
Greece was ahead.
The development of the Community has not been a smooth one, as recent events show.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of the politicians about the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
According to a report published in 2008 or 2009, women in France pay less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay the full price.
Now I can confirm that traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've lived in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since I came back to school.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be on fire soon.
In another article they're writing, two Vauxhall Astras are involved in a collision on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will be quickly forgotten.
That said I'm flying with him next week, so hopefully it won't be on one of these two once we're re-armed.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Has Ryanair charged passengers extra for the extra fear we were willing to provide?
But without this kind of Irish enterprise, you couldn't afford to go on holiday, young man.
I've never taken Ryanair and the last three times I've flown it's been with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can enjoy it.
Any article about Ryanair will trigger dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of people who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs of this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error by the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were transferred to another plane in less than an hour, they're not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that's taking British ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrianised, and literally teeming with people.
People do not flock to the quality of the restaurants (some, most) or to the magazine show at the White Coat Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for the crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think opening on Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris, Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloesFalse!
The only argument that I would find acceptable is that of areas which receive a large number of foreign tourists and is nuanced by the fact that they buy in retail.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows prices to fall.
Sunday rest is a right which, with some exceptions, is enjoyed by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have any power to reform the Labour Code.
So they lock it up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sundays I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 people where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
That's what access to culture is...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he fought tenaciously against fascism
the way of life he fought tenaciously against fascism and bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay for the estate?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
I'm sure his estate would like their share of the pie, if you'll give me the phrase.
His preference for a Franco/Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in general and also add to his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
I'm not sure I'm ready either.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to other aristocrats in the government who wanted to discuss a "deal" with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Through his beautiful rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and ultimately the whole world, can thank God that for these five years, just these five years, Churchill was at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sell the paintings on the open market to raise money for the estate fees, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to see one in a museum, they should raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
There is no denying that when it was  the moment of truth , Churchill's personality was a positive asset to his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
The social reforms advocated by the Minister reflect the real problem of France's distrust of dialogue.
Back to the basics.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let not the weakest among us be in want!
Either we come to his aid in solidarity or he has a RIGHT in return for the services he provides or has provided with a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic fits that vision.
There is also the landlord who lives off the income from his property.
A distinction must be made between those who invest for a return on retirement and those who live on their pensions.
A rental property or two for a couple upstairs is vice.
The little genius of finance is singularly unimaginative.
The New Deal was a policy of large-scale works, but at a time of great infrastructure shortages.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so there's no way a New Deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline is emerging in response to a recession which is nothing but a wild and therefore brutal decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less severe, then the need for investment is glaring: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, energy transport and storage, etc.
A tax that favors high incomes and rentiers.
Who's in charge?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a real galloping man.
Samsung's profits are being hurt by the iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy.
I've tested all these phones and I've decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we went through a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
And we all have different needs, and they can't be met by one manufacturer, because they're not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don't value design at all, they value options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a better car manufacturer? Not really, they're different, but similar.
I'd like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and different markets.
It's healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in all our interests.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umppfrontist friends who say they are fighting ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian fools) could they tell us which author they are fighting ideas about gender and indicate which works they are fighting.
Or are they just addressing the kind of issues described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
So, what are their sources, Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I like you, and you're a smart, educated man.
I said that about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, an approximation that had not occurred to me (I do not have his wit).
If not, in the "depth", since you refer to it, I am not interested in this topic, and honestly I do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could help me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand...
@John: recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne does.
Who's afraid of wondering the world?
But what are we afraid of when we 're afraid ?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first one invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second one calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
You can see how deeply these studies touch their hearts.
We are obviously no longer in the debate on ideas.
It's something else, something much deeper.
@ Did you read, John, that the World published an article about the need for theology?
@: As this is a debate of ideas I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I do not think it is very strict to claim to fight ideas on the basis of the only statement made by their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian).
But, as I was explaining to our umpfront friend, that's the whole difference between having an educated opinion and just an opinion.
I'm not sure he's getting the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I just read the "Second Sex" (that was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights as the moon briefly appeared as the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes being blinded by clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's clouds would really encircle the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
The special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey are holding Labor accountable.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will restore it to its true colour as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne also managed to cover itself for the entire week of the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's an evil genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are improving greatly on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a TAX on this eclipse.
ANYONE who watches this eclipse should pay a TEXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is about Abbott, just like your last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it finally (necessarily) disappears?
It seems you spent a lot of time reading the chatter looking for posts where people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
This is a beautiful picture of the moon over Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is about to collide with Earth!
Nothing on the stock market or real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing on tax evasion.
The ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments for these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so you can make an opinion.
Today, Tuesday 15 October, we have the results of the miraculous revenue: Spain's exports are at their lowest level in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy says that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit of the notaries' courageous attack have the same courage when they present the bill to the state budget?
The next one in due course.
Okay, thank you, JYL.
@lol No the state is not comparable to households in terms of budget management because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life span of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it helps to finance tangible and intangible investments as a guarantee of future growth and therefore future revenue.
Some evidence to answer that.
That was a regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred Hippocratic oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
That's a good conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth is not your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but their hands are tied by the law as written by the policies.
It's the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these matters politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money off of drugs.
That's why pharmacists exist.
Doctors don't make money off of drugs. Since the Liberals want our health care system to be like the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world, doctors are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
Maybe it was a misrepresentation to blame the doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and research.
So read the few reports on our spending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare world prices for drugs available everywhere, as well as differences between countries in what is over-the-counter or prescription only.
It's a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are even now experimenting with inhaled marijuana for cancer pain, despite laws to curb it and expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy about using alternatives such as marijuana, those who come up with a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong. There's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacies.
And the hospital was happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital administrator.
You can't hold patents on weed...
If  social scientists  did research instead of doing politics and networking, maybe we could use their  work .
A researcher investigates, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not searching.
Comparison is about teaching, not research.
You can't say research is done, you have to apply it and then in the same jet you have to experiment with everything.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can someone explain to me how a researcher can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow learning on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
The PISA tests are just an indicator. Let's make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building a gauge that tells you what's good for you, a self-promotion drive, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues out of training and the practitioners out of teaching the practitioners.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of training in the Member States.
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , it is not desirable that practitioners alone teach practitioners , even if they have their place in modern teacher training .
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners, they must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon who has only theoretical training and has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
To give more weight to theorists of education would be to destroy it once and for all.
Your analogy is totally wrong: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has been trained on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of fighting copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you.
If I ever start feeling guilty about violating copyright, I'll just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement is theft.
It's the same thing since they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, that's a copyright violation.
Not the same at all.
By using content without proper licensing, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always argue pedantic assumptions - but it's stealing.
And you can say that as many times as you want, but it won't become true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Go on, say it again.
If I ever start feeling guilty about violating copyright
You obviously don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should be paid for images used in schoolwork, an almost perfect definition of what should constitute reasonable use, then I'm happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson number one should be to show how, if children create anything themselves and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions that they've just clicked.
Maybe if they share their MP3 player headphones with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in this way.
If we could export this resource we have so abundantly, the whiner who says everything is wrong...
If a PS MP says so, then we must believe him.
I have two children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing changes by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I don't want my children to have to carry the debt that this policy will create.
It's speeches like yours that are pulling France down.
@gus I've been working in private company my whole life.
I have had the chance to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: this exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a company, and that choice allows me to shoot red balls at the low-level bosses I frequently meet.
Comfortably in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he is telling the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by linking large companies with medium and small ones - What do French bosses expect to do the same ??
The state holding their hand?
This state they're accusing of being an impostor?
@ Jacques L.
You always say that anti-businessman line.
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so harsh?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are idle and groping while waiting for permanent State assistance!
This is terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45 hours a week for 35 and some, walking on eggshells, dare to demand lower wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the  negative  comments on this subject.
Which is ironic, considering how people always complain about First Group.
From where I'm standing, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat instead of transforming.
That's not to say Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took over.
But they had also improved on their predecessors, including British Rail.
We have no power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn't.
But, hey, Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, right?
It's an international branch.
They already run trains in Germany.
There is nothing to stop people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems we are not very good at management, most of our privatised services end up being run by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all to get the decision overturned.
And there's even better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, won the Crossrail operating contract for eight years.
Well Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers should all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision;)
Perhaps it is because the Dutch management is on track while the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a fighting girl".
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
If we assume that being a "beater" is a quality superior to many others, such as caring for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being a "beater" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: "beater" cancer patients, who have died, I know of some.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's do it again.
I'm not saying it's the condition for managing, I'm saying it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit...!
As for the examples of your life, you are the only one to judge them.
I'll try it again.
To suggest, even for a moment, that you can have merit in recovering from an illness or that you can be disqualified from not recovering from it is simply monstrous.
The body follows or it doesn't follow.
A body that gives up, from all sides, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have any idea what C is?
I'm sorry to say otherwise, but having a strong moral compass may make it easier to accept and prepare for difficult treatments, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, rather than reject them out of fear.
Someone who is beating the odds in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord" it's another matter.
Not with merit or with courage.
These are the moralists' thoughts.
When you catch a piece of shit, a real one, you get ripped off to the point where you're just a zombie.
I've caught two of them myself, dirty ones, big ones, and if I've been "fighting" like these fine psychologists say, I've completely missed it.
Unless this fight is all about grinding teeth, suffering hell and taking the hits.
I thought the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday party.
It's a forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted  quickly  and then swept under the rug.
Is that the story we told back then?
The communist-turned-nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The communist president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
So please ask what we have deliberately left out: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under the least rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
As for RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states which then lied about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he failed to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Ultimately, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we don't like him).
To my knowledge, only in Greece is there a method of predicting earthquakes that works pretty well, by measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This type of study is certainly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water is not related to that of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which is thought to be the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules, according to a study by a team led by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
So, it's a method to follow.
Just like those involving animals sensing a threat coming.
Thank you, science reader, for often feasting us on these experimental feats that are being accomplished around the world.
How would the animals know (AA) ?
This is probably due to the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas that is supposedly odorless to humans but possibly detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable by man, but not by the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have any reliable results on these leads...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals behave strangely for a few hours after an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on Arte about the struggle of two teams of scientists, one from California and the other from Japan, to make their work about the sensitivity of animals to Earth's magnetic fields, and specifically how they change before an earthquake, recognizable.
I'm no scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me.
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this lead?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If you look at it calmly and carefully, it'll be published in a reputable journal, and no one will look down on it.
When we talk about animal signals, we all get the same bias: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake, the goldfish was spinning in strange circles.
I don't understand why anyone would think Boris would make a good leader for the Tories.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and is always trying to distract you with a joke.
He never answers anything directly.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the anchor asked him what it was about.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to run for mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just goes to show how much of the rest of the Conservative Party is a bunch of shit, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in Have I Got News For You.
Because he's a celebrity and people have been taught to worship celebrities.
Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and if) he takes over as party leader, the Tory popularity rating will go through the roof I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their Prime Minister to be one.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R. Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have always been really uninterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the  Solomon  and the  scrap canal  speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
Understandably, the Australians, who knew (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must still be at the bottom since the Battle of Savo) did not want to go back.
We have indeed passed Savo Island in Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecological side is a total smoke screen.
Calculating the kerosene it consumes to reach the target completely discredits the concept.
Just go through the list of sponsors that are philanthropists.
One more operation of neither do nor do.
The cow, it makes you want to eat it!!!
I'm looking forward to the webseries!
Your story makes me think again, identifying me a little in passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de LElorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
The message is also ecological, although some are critical of the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep showing us back, and show us proudly that Britons are great travelers!
Pierre from Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening, I think the red hat who demonstrated against the taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany region and the city of Brest.
More seriously, I think that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes on funding the dreams of even a few equally nice adventurers!
Are there any players in the current Serbian squad who are of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahce, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
Bisevac is the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a midfielder or forward in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a forward in the Velez senior team that, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, twice finished runners-up in the Yugoslav league (and also included the likes of Vahid Halilhodzic and Arsene Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
We said he was going to be a great player when he was at Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn.
I can't help you now.
I know he lost his job when Conte came in, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not the owner.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, you don't have to be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag on that drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little over-nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there wasn't much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with a map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give pieces of the country to the neighboring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" when two towers collapsed knowing that women, men and no doubt children were inside?
How did you do that?
What bothers me a little about this "testimony" is that the very fact that I was able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, shows me a borderline personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost caution.
No doubt, during that brief "joyful" moment, no thought was given to the dead or to the reality of the horror.
You just thought, for a moment, that for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically hurt the great evil Satan in his own heart.
To make something powerful.
It was great.
It seems that this sentiment was shared by thousands of Muslims who were consumed by a sense of humiliation.
With video evidence from Palestine.
It's a classic Schadenfreude.
We kind of suspected that.
The "Christian/white/Gaul" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Musuman when he contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this hellhole?
In a completely synchronized fashion, two major poisons are irrigating the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers that be and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of his critical expression.
Just because we understood it before, shouldn't make Muslims back down.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long months of darkness, humidity and depression that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everybody gets sick.
It's seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the lights go out, it's hell for me and people like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little with your mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside is especially breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathless as the summer greenery when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, so don't be a cliché grump.
Not all of them.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now that I'm retired and no longer developing immunity to outside germs, I guess that could change.
It's not about being about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates in festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risk of snow and a whole lot of other wonderful words.
Just keep doing things !
Here are my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, those dark and gray months do make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child surcharges, the amount collected by the State is mainly from 8 to 10 deciles.
However , the number of households whose tax has increased as a result of this measure is mainly in deciles 4 and 5 (median income) as shown in Chart 2 .
The removal of half the share, especially for widows, is not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230 million euros is a joke that ignores the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And he's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on straw, but we're thinking.
Once the PS has a left-wing policy we won't cry...
It is obvious that those in the richest 20% have to bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's keep it up and you'll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled at the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the use of money is over, money is only used to make money, that is, to make the greatest number unhappy.
We're in the top 20 percent.
The 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed) are also likely to be the most active.
A fair tax should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or maybe you should just lay down your arms and live on the minimum, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge's headhunters have happily lived on.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
I'm all right.
In one of them, we had things we wouldn't have in a five-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the front desk or face any hassle.
You just go to someone's house, sleep there, clean up after yourself and leave.
From now on, it'll be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowners insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love airbnb.
 It's very dangerous and highly risky  No, it's not true.
You just really had bad luck.
From the link provided in the article:
When he was discharged, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel, and transferred $23,817 (which Airbnb is insured for, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he didn't get any support from Airbnb?
I love airbnb, to receive and to travel
Hello. I'm looking for people who have used airbnb before just to reassure myself.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little afraid of sending £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
 Support the troops , sang the Bu$herie on all tones...
So they're harmless weapons.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for the families and loved ones of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends died for something other than Saddam Hussein's chemical bombings.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to be polite).
Furthermore, how does this mass murder in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It's not very clear what the author's style is: "Searching for weapons of mass destruction".
We're in agreement.
You think it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
We would already be making a great deal of progress in education if we made them work 35 hours instead of 17.
Our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And let's not be led to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But you don't see it because the National Education does not have the means to provide a middle school/high school office for its teachers so they work from home.
It's a kind of forced telework, except the employer doesn't pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it's so much hiding at 5pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES in maths, come, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to hang out with bad-mannered kids whose parents spit on you and call you a wanker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where you see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first job after graduation was in sales in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a job that required a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad for a job working for the London Underground, it was £5,000 a year extra and you didn't even have to apply for a licence.
I never regretted it.
Don't worry about that if you don't get a job with a degree, try to find something that either pays well or you enjoy doing.
If I'd stayed in graduate jobs, I'd still be paying off my student loan.
I don't like working in a corporation so much, so I hope to eventually move into either the civil service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year gap.
What's the best way to reduce the number of graduates who are unemployed?
Getting rid of the big-time fields like art/literature/theatre/media/philosophy/political science, that is what we call unemployment degrees.
I got one of those degrees and I ended up as a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not a degree but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout university.
You start out with a lower salary, but you move up quickly because in the real world, it's the results that matter more than the knowledge.
This engineering/art studies debate has been going on for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in a way that gets results.
Letters, philosophy and art are two different fields?
This is ridiculous.
I assume you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever nonsense field you went into.
Literature, philosophy, political science and art are real courses.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the fundamentals of culture like literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and revitalize the rest of France?
I personally find it difficult to see people from the far end of Essonne and the Val-d'Oise cycling 80km round trip every day to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner city and the small belt already have many other, more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure, locked parks, such as those already in northern European cities such as Dijon and Lyon, will be set up on the roadside.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, the City of Paris is expected to work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
I think we can all benefit from their vast experience in this field.
Well, we couldn't find room for a single bicycle hook.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Okay, this is not right.
When we talk to pedestrians and other public transport users about why they don't cycle, I think the main reasons that come up are: 1/ it's hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that go super fast and don't care about the survival of bikes 2/ we get a lot of pollution in our heads.
Cycle lanes are apartheid, we have to live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about bicycle parking on public transport?
EELV is right.
The 15% cycling target is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens into flour.
In fact, according to OR, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering starts, we better find out who's really behind this massacre.
Clue: it's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is changing.
It looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to take the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down before, Ukraine was launching airstrikes in the area against the rebels and of course any plane could be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in light of a clear threat or did it choose to gamble with the lives of innocent people so that airlines would pay for the overflying of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government/the ultra-nationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to prove basically that Putin shot down MH17.
As far as I know, there's already a complaint against the Kiev government because they're responsible for what happens in their skies.
The previous one: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the Contras rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no way Russia is gonna let this go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott is trying to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his claims.
So far, investigators have said nothing of the sort.
It's a shame to be Ricardo and be such a big eco-beast.
To call yourself Polar is to lose the North is to rejoice.
One question is: is the poor today poorer than the poor yesterday?
I cannot help but notice that the most virulent critics of Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read. It took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of production income, capital income, inequality concentration, inequality of labour income, capital ownership, merit and inheritance in log term.
He shows that the concentration of capital today is similar to that of the early 20th century before 1914, he shows that it was the two world wars that caused the concentration of capital to fall, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration recovers after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what?
I ask you how long it took you to read this board knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Second, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without reading the book, which is essentially a one-way argument in its favour.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paper summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't.
I therefore trust the summary of his central thesis, and that seems to me to be pure nonsense.
The concept of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has not mankind become rich in general?
And this enrichment coupled with population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and undoubtedly deserves the award.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope this prize will not be a burden on the young girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
I wish Malala all the best, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the slums of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little weird?
She thanked her father for giving her so much freedom but said that if she had not been where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Is not Malala herself one of these  colored perverts ?
You shouldn't have any airtime on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
This is absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't gonna marry her at 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a school where girls are educated and is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan in that he believes women are equal to men.
What she was saying was that the average Pakistani girl often has to get married at 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't put it out clearly enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe what she means is that if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
I'm rather disappointed in this season 4 entry and especially Jessica Lange who is obviously having a little trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich lookalike character.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit this is one of the best horror shows, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfect and the performance of Jessica Lange singing Bowie's Life on Mars is just mind-blowing.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be my last without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have it all at once than watch 13 episodes over three to four months.
But one thing is for sure, aside from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it's the risks of staging and editing that really get me.
We have a flood of original footage in AHS that makes a mockery of the desensitization of today's productions.
It's a little hard to see you throwing in the towel ahead for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to measure the quality.
Jessica Lange is a mainstay of this show, but, as you say, there's a lot more to it than that.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And I look at her a lot.
Then I find the show is a bit of a writer's block, trying to do too many things at once.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I can't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours of what.
But everybody does what they want.
It's because I say I won't look anymore that everyone else has to do the same!
I simply share my viewpoint, no more, no less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to her.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut back on government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to cut back on spending failed.
To stir up controversy about relatively small expenditure items, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that the voters seem to be calling for and all the while some in every camp are pretending that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see their game clearly and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of the expenditure.
The debt is the total of assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
Debt is nothing to worry about.
I would have no problem with the government taking a third of my income (before I even talk about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be used wisely.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
They say Nigel Farage wasn't entirely honest about how to cut taxes but hey, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the almost useless subsidies for wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dems' tax on the most luxurious homes look pretty ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone earning £35,000 a year will pay about £5,000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10,000 (one fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 pays about £70,000 (just over a third).
What about the social security ?
Plus social security, plus local taxes, plus parking fees and car registration, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is withheld before local taxes and car registration.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of tax dollars go.
How can an unemployed person who goes door to door looking for work prove it?
Even if 20 percent of the unemployed wouldn't look, that means 80 percent look and don't find.
Since I'm unemployed myself, do I care more about what other people are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances just as much.
I haven't heard from the job centre in months, so the agents are more busy checking the job openings than actually running the job listings?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not the state's job to provide jobs.
If Pole Employment doesn't provide enough jobs, then we have to do without Pole Employment.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, so we make sure that the unemployed are given their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport tickets from the users of a means of transport, a department head or the employees of their job, etc.
Nobody screams scandal in these cases, do they?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with the Employment Service, my rights to the AARP had been misstated, and in one case, 40% of the workforce was cut off, I had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not a legal expert.
The registration and control is now taking over, while statutory employment centre is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should concern only employees, who pay contributions.
The politicians and the French non-salaried people are taking rights they don't actually have!
This is not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of wage labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus doesn't reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with war and the displacement of people at that time.
The Saudis have had the nerve to ban this year's Hajj to Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have had their visa applications denied because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hajj in the 1980s, probably from a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world has the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense but apparently those who know have decided that we can risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's leaving.
Only medical personnel are allowed in.
21 days after treating patients before they can leave.
If they catch Ebola while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
In the past week alone, people have been infected after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking  all necessary precautions .
We can stop this disease from spreading.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
We should stop them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately quarantined.
If he can get the message of the individual first and the group (including religious) second, he will have won the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he's capable of making a dogma of the image of God characterized by the entire functioning cortex of the planet.
He's still a long way from that conception.
It's only been 20 years since information emerged as the humanity's first prize, while religion, born of the brain, has been directing our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is a large minority in France today, and no one is forced to join it.
The critics would not step foot in the church anyway, except for the small number of Protestants in France.
What's the next step, take away the notion of sin, too "anxiety-producing"?
@louise: Sorry the church doesn't have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you see it existed before Christ.
Hillel had already told him a century before: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, that is the whole Torah and the rest is only commentary: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity and introduces agape.
Your "growth of righteousness, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism?
Next step, we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who overturned moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take their part in the ethical debates of our societies and to promote justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think the reason for the low number of Protestants in France is that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and forced to emigrate a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
You can't make that up.
Personally, I would go with SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you're interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM at £30 and also offering a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM at £30 and also offering a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Not at work, of course.
The computer department's jock blockers are blocking all the cool sites.
Hello, is it £30 plus 20% off, or does the £30 include the 20% off?
Note however: the PC version is for DX11 only.
I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, that sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'm afraid they'll erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on people who buy it there when they're out of the designated area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was 1940 France a "rotten earth"?
Tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of the 40s, the France of the "strange defeat"?
When you see who wins the Nobel Prize for literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize isn't even an event, you don't even want to read the prize-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, who is already difficult to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible, but frankly, I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection with literature.
Have you even read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better for judging.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll appreciate Mr. B.
Modiano for what he's worth, if they don't already know him!
And you, keep up the good work with Levi and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso have all their chances.
Let 's see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature:
Painter in 2005, D.
Hey, you creepy ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing followed me here.
Maybe she wants to run me over?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer in Superman III?
Hello Dantra, are you still hating?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Party.
It was messy.
I've managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving home on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night, we went to my friend's grandfather's to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's luck I was able to walk away with some decent bets.
I hope when I'm 95, I'll be as sharp as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you'll see how wrong you are, dear Christian.
I think you are a little off topic, though, without offending you.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She's quick to report arms deals.
Either you have your eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or you have your eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
You don't get to the light by keeping your eyes closed.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Whoever says nothing agrees.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, my dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for all.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the French Jews' approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them of this a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there's no doubt, you might as well say so.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to close contact with ISIS or to conviction of ISIS.
Silence is a very practical weapon, the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the election,  take revenge  on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has grown between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing his ass off.
What are these threats?
The Tories don't give a damn about Scotland because they don't have a seat.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They're going to be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who are going to cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the PROVISION thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrants of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leader accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralisation.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or the Tories want to be re-elected one day in England.
Polishing the pumps by 8 percent at the expense of 85 percent, that's not a great election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters affecting England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and it worked out for her.
Yet he is still running for prime minister in 2015 and has been since winning the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over their shoulder and see what they're reading, how they're reading, and all the way through.
It's the lives of others in East Germany or the KGB in the world of FRIC...
Still the same fascination with surveillance techniques.
In the long run, it will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I'll wait for the next one: Amazon makes your book based on your profile and automatically thanks to an algorithm of its own secret!
It's a happy place.
Highly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
Since under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I am left to read pirated files, books in the public domain or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer uncluttered files.
Considering the price I paid for the Kobo, I have no regrets.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users to the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general bookstore, you will notice that everyone is giving away their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, etc.).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.
For example, Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in one bin.
The anonymous data collection when there's a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, which does not allow the reader or the author to be identified.
But Kobo has all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten classroom full of acid-deprived schizophrenic kids.
It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It's interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot unless it gains something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will strike back, so it's effectively shooting herself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog:  The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation or simply advising caution.
The second option is more likely, and in any case, what is really surprising is that today the diplomatic engagement between Iran and the US is about Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
The short article you link is important and should be read with the realistic observations/warnings from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979-1980 in mind.
Who are these  moderates  who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world into the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to nonexistent moderates that they pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending other people's children to fight in World War III.
 It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism  Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
We should have a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should I ?
You realize that neither the perpetrators nor the victims have a chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy.
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly regarding the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a remote part of Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a crazy thing to do.
An impressive command of the sophistication of the fatal slope, but beyond that, we seek in vain contact with reality.
It's just a bunch of clichés without a story.
The fetus will always hear a heartbeat even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted.
Same with sterile heterosexual couples.
And the children!
What a shame to label them future psychopaths.
One day they will be old enough to defend themselves, to say they are happy to live, to earn a living and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
GPA is perhaps a temporary "solution" in the medical evolution of our world.
It's not from today.
Many women have borne and given birth to children who were not their husbands.
It's still the way it is, the way we're made...
The important thing is that this practice is regulated so that the "commoditisation" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, aren't they also commodification of bodies?
The Anachronic Fareinheit .
It is certainly more elegant to get a good woman pregnant in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to take on your responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another century near your home without shouting it at that time on all rooftops! ...
And these practices were not done in the name of the church!
It's not just Christians and believers who reject these practices...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands, I only saw this from a distance.
I had to go in the daytime because I couldn't go in the night!
But if you like that and you listen to music - that music today still touches you just as much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who were never cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there's an article on football waiting for your comments.
That's a great article.
Since Tony Parson's film, there's been a shortage of news stories that truly reflect the reality of Northern England culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has a good grasp of the social and political context. He understands things.
Northern soul is still alive, but it's been vampirized by capitalism and today it's essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you're in the London area in November: 99psoul will once again be playing soul vinyl, including a full Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I too thought  always the same story , but here is a well written and well thought out little article.
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive.
That's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By taking pills.
Whatever station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes' walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The early days of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of George Gently's detective series Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more toxic.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace as he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (as was the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
And he stripped off his garments, and laid them upon the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got up in anger and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clear
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not let their guard down...
That this is not pleasing to the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the intended purpose...
Anti-Zionist: But I have answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it 's been that way ever since politics became global ...
Avoidance, avoidance, I mean that.
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
You're not responsible for the creation of Israel.
What balance of power led to the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a power struggle today!
Do you doubt that ?
Plus it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time getting past anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says is just pseudo-chomskyist bullshit written by nobody else.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a question of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths we'd rather not think about.
Hang on, this feeling is gonna get more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand is horrified by some: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious way and after all the tabloid nonsense he actually makes himself look like a beginner populist, but this whole vote-no-vote thing has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that he's just telling people not to vote and instead to fold their arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic engagement to that is completely useless, the two parties (to slightly different degrees) governing essentially in favor of special interests, multinationals and the rich, at no point does he say to simply ignore politics completely because those parties don't govern in our name: he insists that just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become more politically active, organize movements and influence politics, from local movements, petitions, to political influence.
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active by making demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are like air bubbles that will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it's infuriating to see all these condescending responses that say this Jesus-making idiot is telling young people not to bother voting and just hope things will get better because it's really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people debated what he really says rather than just labeling him irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
- Yes, thank you. - Thank you.
The whole vote thing was completely twisted.
The pointlessness of slipping a ballot into a ballot box every five years really pisses me off because my vote really doesn't matter.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who are accountable locally to their constituents.
Furthermore, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own sayings and ideas, even if these are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label  pseudo-chomskyist billevesas .
I'm pretty sure he could convince Suzanne in a debate.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, have Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a porch, with even the nodding added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's going with it.
It draws on a political discourse that has been around for generations, but has been marginalized by mainstream media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This slingshot shows me above all that intellectual debate has long ceased to be held at the RDE of history, where professional historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have been reduced to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po-type press files.
I myself had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a guilty man, a scapegoat.
They both develop very rational reasoning, but that rationality is based on these scapegoats that are the cornerstone of their thinking.
I think rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
You solve the problem of the relationship by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-liberal and/or/libertarian slope (the latter of the two terms marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the former knowing how to seek state help for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not state at all in Foucault.
The old dream of the base organizing itself beautifully.
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it cannot stand.
If you say guilty, you mean elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Not a support system .
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god of the day, Stalin, the little father of the people.
Oulala, you may have read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology to Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would not enjoy attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet makes a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether you agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can't stand to be left out of their mantra, is pretty laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
I think it is important to add that the attitude of these "rebels" is purely intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other yellow people I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends on the subject, then.
And where in Russia could a Russian meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were kind to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violent anti-white remarks.
My dad's not happy that his oldest daughter's dating a white guy.
I also think attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading beyond the big cities, and because of this prosperity people are traveling abroad and seeing how other people live.
I have been told that Russians are especially prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in jobs and areas where they are likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really strange for a stranger to tell me that I can't stand Chinese, when I've met two in my life (one abroad), I don't have bad memories of them, all people are equal and, in fact, the ones in London were very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don't remember who you meet, everyone is equal, how do you remember who was who?
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, like they're an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're still dating that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there's a good chance that these white parents would physically assault them.
No measure of fairness in justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and the justice system in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the judiciary union...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the courts are frankly brand a right.
In the Judiciary Union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
While a measure of its bias can be drawn from the relativity of the application of the law in the courts, it requires two obstacles to be removed.
The political view of the observer and the interpretation of the facts of the judge.
The legal instrument to refocus evaluation on the fundamentals remains.
The extent to which it is not observed in all judicial acts of judges, including the public prosecutor's office, makes it necessary to distinguish between error and partiality on the part of judges.
It would be futile to claim that acts of righteousness are not shared by these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics which implicitly show that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
The Court of Justice has already ruled that the Court of First Instance cannot be held to be competent to rule on a question of law.
The area under consideration is that of the expropriation of heirs committed even by means of fraudulent procedures by notarial-mandated genealogists.
The profession earns €150 million a year and at the same time benefits from the protection* provided by the near-impunity* of the French notary.
For an understanding of their mechanism, some of these have been reported in the comments following the first publication.
The extent to which this is consistent with the statistical improvement moderated by the previous comment is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be robbed, a whole body of case law contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics that ignores such rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Prices that are probably totally prohibitive.
More equipment to rip off the handicapped.
You could say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, custom built for his size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors in a way that a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, never could.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tank Chair looks like something Jeremy Clarkson might come up with for a Top Gear challenge.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I don't think the man who invented the Whill ever had to clean a dog poo on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here they'd like.
The prices do seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so  you see .
I find the tricycle all-terrain particularly useful.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have insurance policies that are reasonably priced.
Only if they've become disabled.
The thing is, the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to charge high prices for things that they know we need.
You can't really say the Whill is minimalist.
It's an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not planned to be manufactured.
I'm glad the long-distance wheelchair isn't coming to market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been held prisoner by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power in the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockade!
This is a unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, because this blockade is a  collective punishment  for all the civilians in Gaza.
" Contractors working on their projects divert a small amount of their cement to the black market ... "
Ah, that's not a wooden tongue, it's more like concrete and the lady's armed...
References are there to support an argument or a fact.
He 's anti-Zionist .
Good cement goes in the tunnels!
There's a black market, that's for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been held prisoner by Israel's blockade of Gaza since 2007.
This is a unique situation in the world, and it is unacceptable to anyone with a heart and a moral sense.
The US has a well-guarded ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Don't forget that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I agree with...
Jonathan , please .
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down by the people who chose their masters!
Owning a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought this through.
Couchsurfing is way cooler than Airbnb.
That's the very definition of a sharing economy, not for profit.
A lot of people are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping to get paid) in another way.
It's always a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you look for the right address.
In addition, landlords and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this?
What's she renting on?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We don't use the verb  to let  in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety regulations and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will certainly refuse).
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or kidnapped by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants coming here and attacking our barges...
Where are you going to tie him up?
No, Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism ?
There is no truth except that which sets forth the facts!
Poverty is rising in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's for what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said !
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our commodities, therefore our food, with the structures of care, therefore our health, with our debts, therefore our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and our money that they hold..
All for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until the contrary is proved, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild banker as Minister of Economy, in a bid to better defend the interests of the banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else who could?
What do you call that, flip your jacket, pull down your pants?
Primary and populist reaction
In fact, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really refused to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report of a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still rough at the end of the battle.
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue effort more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Falklands War, where photos showing survivors being rescued show a calm, clear daylight.
And the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, that doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
Some confusion existed among the German ships about the fate of the two armored cruisers, which had disappeared into the darkness after ceasing fire, and a pursuit began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as they got closer they saw it was just a wreck.
Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw Monmouth, leaning and badly damaged but still moving.
After pointing his lights at the flagship, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope must have escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before radar was invented, didn't know a ship had sunk, and therefore couldn't search for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have damaged them badly, so in confusion they skidded off to take advantage of their lead.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they would have to fight their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally captured.
Several voices in the UMP are calling for it to be written into law that a person who has been convicted is therefore permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would certainly affect the elected representatives of the left.
But no, this is a joke.
For this idea I propose an inscription on the wall of the magistrates' ass.
When will the ban on unions in already protected areas be lifted?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens?
It is maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to appease those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to move things, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is to their satisfaction.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little "pennies for justice" signs. They were from the provinces and they didn't know the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized trade unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted figures on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If the right is currently defying the legal news it is simply because it has committed acts that fall within its sphere of influence!
There is no example of a leftist personality who has had so much to do with justice but not everyone who has been the object of his attention has been treated favorably.
It is also important to remember that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only union of judges and is a minority.
The fact that a minister is so committed to supporting trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you mention may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is no secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is more to pollute than to teach.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is in the minority.
What are you complaining about ?
@Pivoine: you forget that magistrates are not officials like everyone else: they alone have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody ?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
I'm here to see you.
I think even the most gluttonous moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if anyone took them up on that offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to a successful career.
One Direction is filling stadiums all over the world.
Others have since sold many records or moved to the West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is, in fact, one of the judges.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, they all competed in Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the rest have competed in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens to most stars who don't compete anyway.
Few people succeed in making more after one hit.
Anyway, most singers/bands can only hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the U.K.
Her fame comes in part from her marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your wildest dreams you think that all those guitar-playing pricks who smoke weed in their dad's garage and swing three chords on a grade-school-level poem are probably gonna become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous, it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied -- a distance that quickly turns into racism, because the sacred ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and riddled with ritual bigotry, when most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations of everyday life.
Except you're recklessly interpreting it the other way around.
But rather than say that the drum is devoid of sacredness, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières are not also a little sacred?
Our bias is to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, though.
It's a little ephemeral decor to furnish the void.
That's all I got.
Great article, thank you.
The recent pantheonisation of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacredness is still alive.
Who still believes the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw at the edges of the earth the unscientific interpretations that last a Mandarin's life, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of discipline so we can have a little fun?
Because what is true of archaeology is also true of the interpretations that other disciplines give.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified !
It is through them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their  instinct  and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Today, the technical and scientific means are so advanced that the interpretation of the excavations is better, but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
This is in the middle of an old controversy about shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book  The shamans of prehistory , especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article.
Do straight men like anal sex?
I could do it for you, Mike.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, for grown-ups.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play about it.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, though, that would be too gay!
We should have expected that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you switch to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers the microwave.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, brave journalists to cover the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own peril.
Rather than make you laugh with those childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
You can go.
If these "puppy ass jokes" are so shocking to you, you don't have to participate, do you?
Did you also know that this paper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it's entirely possible to do both and publish an article about anal sex?
Is that the topic that shocks you, or is it the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we found the amateur video of the crash on the Internet...
Amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests and not the driver's.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers they would have taken out the safety because at some point another vehicle (for example a tow truck) was entering the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon, which we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the start time (direct TV, advertising, money ...).
But other than that, they're good at protecting pilots.
Of course, I agree with that.
But there's also the fact that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at the start to beat the Englishman who was leading then...
You're going to hell on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I have a little time to pick up all your shit.
No, I just didn't.
There have been plenty of conspiracies in F1, but never one that put stewards in mortal danger over a long-standing story of one driver's chance of winning at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that puts out the safety because it's the FIA.
Shade of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of images mainly helps the FIA to avoid the embarrassing questions of: How does the referee wave a green flag in the middle of an intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that it is no longer under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a grim disregard for F1.
Yes, dear Stephen, the race is no longer under yellow flag after the crash site, hence the green flag waved.
This is the usual procedure.
The stewards' station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) waves the green to tell the drivers to return to normal speed.
Sensationalism is selling advertising.
I used to think that the media was part of the government's  patriotic  propaganda offensive but I'm afraid that in the end it's all about money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making a buzz with information that you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all get scared. It should be "distract", not "cough".
Given the medical reference,  coughing  is much better said in this context than  derailing .
I wonder if all the people who are afraid that Ebola could start spreading through the air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're too much of an honor to them.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola with Murdoch.
Great article, thank you.
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this vile pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media is talking about most things with this upside-down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting into hysteria) for the government to slip us when it needs to.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have to have a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for being still here almost 35 years later.
Plus , it must have been awful at first , given the context of the ' 80s and ' 90s .
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years in it.
That's a completely useless testimony.
It's always the same when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless, but they cannot be used as scientific material in isolation.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we avoid asking questions of psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file says my psychiatric mother explained that I was raised telepathically by her stepmother.
So this is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the evidence of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
So what's your research based on?
What about fantasies?
Do you equate fanciful theories with facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimony)?
 Resilience : the fake word worshipped by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading Dansembourg.
@Jim: There are a lot of empty buzzwords in psy.
Cyrulnik did the "resilience" thing for us.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he's devised a reliable scale to quantify this resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to bring the Sentinels out of the air...
Why would you do that?
It was a great show and it seems like the people who make it know it!
Let us leave our salvation to the Almighty, who can do wonders.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang up?
The only solution I can think of is the pee-pee-pee humor, which would kill the show.
It was a children's show.
The kids were hanging up.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in the Super Mario world?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is done right.
I'm looking forward to seeing this (although I'm an adult), but I hope it will give a network the idea to re-air the old ones.
The show has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; we've had one-hour episodes every Saturday and Sunday at 6am for at least 40 years.
Since the advent of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen on these schedules.
And the half-hour episodes are now airing at 5:30 a.m., Monday through Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a sad 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations under and around the Esplanade Mosque over the decades have yielded nothing.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, it's somewhere else.
Can it be in Argentine?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the Esplanade of the Mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the Mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
Once it's been captured and put into context, it's not propaganda, it's information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and they are unfortunately being passed on to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, who had accepted the two-state plan, and continuously sabotaged it!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem was not a peaceful event.
Can God know his own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "Praise God!"
To show off tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïads half-naked, lying on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what we are shown in advertising, as can be seen in the picture in the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this picture is a beautiful piece of propaganda!
It's a shame that the Reuters photographer didn't take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to go back to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone the Jewish worshippers below, praying at the Western Wall.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's rightly so, it's not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that should be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going into a tailspin, the big companies have taken a huge advantage of their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford a raise, while at the same time, and without hiding it, they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top.
You're right, it's not sustainable, but it's not going to change in this country until workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of whining and moaning when someone else goes on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't fuck people up with impunity.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, yes, it's sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where the social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India, for example.
This can't all end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's held up.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TIPP) aims to increase the profits of the companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
It may seem incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will do to our lives.
It's only recently that we've started to hear about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This is a very good thing, but digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right. In the 18th century there were unions in every regiment.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (well, her officers, the others, nobody knows anything) think she's the safe-deposit box of France's eternal values, and she'll fight and shut up.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of nation, having this little relic, it's comforting.
Even if it's becoming more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, single men, married women, single men, stray dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't spell French right, I'm joining the union.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
The protection of the trade unions is already sufficiently exploited to protect the interests of the class, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We're not supposed to laugh about a public servant's fear of danger.
It is quite possible to imagine a system which would guarantee a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the carts coming in, the government is welcoming it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since that is the subject here discussed...
Let's remove "through his delegates" from Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises.'
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled  The Great British Bake Off review . ?????
Wait, the section was here, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you some of it was well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (though misleading: it was the wine) in television history.
Also, some pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones !
I love the GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with the least bad baker winning; nobody was like, boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master.
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
The previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And then there's this idea of playing it safe, there's always next week, which disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing this to myself.
I'm grateful to those who do and so provide us with great entertainment and encourage us to try new things.
Let 's go for the 2015 GBBO !
I agree, last year's final challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
It usually takes days for professionals to make them, and they had to tinker with one in three to four hours.
The three challenges were really hard to beat, I don't know how they could pick a winner.
In Luis' case, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (though I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make him want to, anyway Richard had already lost by then).
I must admit that many of the challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time available.
Then there's the cancer that lurks, with the solar winds.
We're definitely doing all right right right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You're confusing solar wind with ultraviolet light.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed by the impact of particles from the solar wind and UV.
So even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to drive ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the benefit of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to warm us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancer-causing UVC and allows UVA and most UVB to pass through.
You know you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor a fool when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor detail that was implied in the comment, which itself is intended to be pedagogical.
Not to mention I'm a melanoma addict, UV rays only accelerate its growth.
They don't cause it.
For example, not all tanned people have melanoma.
Or, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in a basement, you better not listen because UV is necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we put it in the blender?
Or put it in the blender...
I think most people who are interested in this have established that anything can be bent if you apply enough force to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more robust and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communications device.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
Most of the people who are interested in it have established that anything can be bent if you apply enough force to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already bent?
We make that joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype could be distributed like that.
Before you install specific software, you imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and you can't see how it could get back in.
So, what is this?
Most likely it's a production unit on which iOS was not installed properly and is therefore stuck with factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all of them?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah, the ultimate bobo article.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrialists produce in  industrial We put forward super u but all the brands and small business meme are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650 € (average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly on a small salary.
Afterwards, everyone is free to set their priorities wherever they want.
Food is one of them.
Go without a grudge, I kiss you
Bobos, or more accurately boboecolos, are people who see the world through a  software  ideological lens that causes them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total disassembly of thought and reason.
They're experts at gestures, for example, claiming to save the planet because they skipped a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-wing caviar, from which they sometimes originate, for example by condemning the CO2 emissions while on holiday in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens cannot stand this mixture of heavy-handed ideology and truffle, so don't be surprised if you often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this thorough and exhaustive theorizing and all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't seem to fit in.
The concept is not that complicated.
The booboocoos are single-unit.
You understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological twist.
The classification would be more complicated if we were to focus on ecologues in general.
The eco-boob is one of them, but it is only the most visible fringe of the eco-boob because it is the one that infests the media.
There's a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
She's so badly made, she looks vaguely like a naked woman.
Shut up, you're right next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin can't draw and always seems to be obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really did manage to become fabulously rich and famous without any artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a proven fact.
It's more of an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are lifelike reproductions of dogs smoking while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing reality.
If that's all you're looking for, a camera will do.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still savings to be made: in equestrian activities, in the number of horses in the Republican Guard or in the status of retired generals.
I must say, in all honesty, that France is reducing its workforce, but as have all countries, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it's quickly reaching its limits!
This is a strange approach at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses and inadequacies of our defence equipment, particularly in the Sahel.
This is a serious blow to the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where you can save money but especially not at my house, at my house it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing, to look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
I want everyone who has had a little bit of experience with the military to come here and say, eye to eye, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter, and that without laughing...
If we apply the same potion to the entire civil service, the public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public employment in other ministries and you will understand why the Defense can feel a little overwhelmed!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees on that we should do, it must be visible somewhere, right?
No matter what, the people it happens to moan at the murder when it happens to them, poor darlings.
I should do it, but I should make sure it doesn't fall on me because in this case, it's a crime, not an economy.
Go on, you little shit!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with every closure of a post office, maternity ward, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't enjoy savings in public spending.
This article is truly the most mind-blowing thing I've ever read!
That awkward moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's depressing to scroll through your Facebook feed and see that 80% of your friends have started their statuses with the phrase  This embarrassing moment .
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
It's probably based on some hilarious scene where someone accidentally bumps into their ex on the bus on the way to work and only realizes that their skirt is back in their panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, I think the author is taking on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and grit his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after a 25-year absence was something powerful.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who gets the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has truly proven that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling on my back!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they can finally have the enlightenment and experience the incredible glow and unsurpassed genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, that was so bad.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite, you know.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are being denied the right to save our planet by states that play truffles at every rally to save the planet.
We, the citizens, therefore, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they put in charge of energy, all these fine recommendations have gone to hell.
Wind turbines and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in its waste and in the event of an accident.
Until the whole industry is under control, it is best to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity from renewable sources to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not involved in this.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions at the production stage and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG than other sources, especially gas, or worse than coal, as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would be counterproductive to the fight against CO2.
I'm a doctor of physical sciences, 1981 and I've done research in nuclear physics. I challenge you to prove the opposite.
For what I didn't say it's you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't respond to what I said and like all right people destroy the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an inefficient and inefficient way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the energy efficiency of nuclear power plants. The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the energy efficiency of nuclear power plants.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a  giant of South Asia ...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised, most of the Indian commenters only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, that's a good sign of your mindset.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against some Pakistani players playing, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be opening a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico beating Mumbai 3-0.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our  noisy neighbours ...
The low-cost pitcher race is cash.
It's a shame about such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design flaw is only manifested with helium that is too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but in a implementation flaw...
Unlike Arianspace which is a private company, it seems that you are owned by the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more disturbing as many media outlets repeat only the headlines of articles - and many readers only remember these headlines.
In total this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I agree with you completely, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is only a launching problem.
