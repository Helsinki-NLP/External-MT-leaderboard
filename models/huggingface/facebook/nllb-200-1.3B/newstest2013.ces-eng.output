The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders have justified their policies on the necessity of fighting electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after being struck by lightning.
Republican lawyers have only documented 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the last decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States has statewide responsibility for organizing federal elections.
And in that spirit, most U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009 that make it harder to vote or register to vote.
This phenomenon has seen a surge since the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills restricting voting rights were introduced in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register on the day of the elections and deprive citizens with criminal records of the right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the Indiana law was upheld in 2008 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this procedure to other states.
In the past two years, 34 states have passed such laws to force voters to produce photo IDs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by their state government.
Furthermore, about five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
Additionally, the required ID often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mainly young people, minorities and low-income people.
25% of African Americans, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000, 18% of those over 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their sympathy for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school's photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs in elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for elections.
The first such requirement was put in place by Arizona.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported laws in eight states that would abolish voter registration on Election Day.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register some 10 million people.
However, the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in the number of new voters registered in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at shortening the early election period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, African-Americans made up 33% of the early voters, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
The same thing happened with the Spanish.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who made up 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted early.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters have been very vocal in opposing the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Democratic governors have blocked several bills with their vetoes.
In an effort to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General even intervened.
They've managed to contain some of the damage.
For example, laws requiring photo IDs have been adopted by only 16 of 34 states.
However, the new rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Critics of democracy mostly speak of the bias of the passed laws, which they see as an obvious attempt to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: to be tested or not?
The PSA test often yielded false negative or even false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
All this has increased the reluctance of men who are already so reluctant to go for examination at all.
Do you want to get tested or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
The studies in the USA showed high levels of contamination between the different test groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make any valid recommendations.
Another study, this time in Europe, found a difference in mortality between patients who had been tested and those who had not.
The study also showed that after a 12-year interval, those who did not go for the test had a 30 to 40 percent higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend testing at age 50 or 40, if you have a close relative with prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and there are non-aggressive types.
It is therefore essential to properly explain the risk of the cancer to the patient, to offer possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer which has no long-term impact on life, and to focus on active surveillance of the disease in these cases.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and life-threatening.
We'll suggest that they be actively monitored and treated if they progress.
More and more often, we are setting criteria with greater precision to help us decide which species to treat and which not.
I still recommend you take the test.
However, it is important to talk to your doctor about whether or not you should have a test.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, Movember has developed a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and exercised enough, up to 30 percent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50 percent", points out André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Society for Cancer Research.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers falls.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They're also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", grunts André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the city.
Encouraging fact: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
According to the SCC, body weight and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreas and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular, lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer", adds the report.
Food
That organisation also recommends that red meat be restricted.
Excessive consumption may lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid the same for the meat.
Preserving meat by steaming, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer", adds the report.
Other
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet reached a clear conclusion.
The studies focusing on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC.
While one suggests a reduction in prostate cancer risk, other studies suggest an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly proven.
Mr. Beaulieu further stresses the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Doing a test doesn't mean you'll get cancer".
The Higgs boson studied
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson sparked a justifiable stir last summer.
There's a theory that this boson is involved in the mechanism that's responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And then there's the last particle that's predicted by the Standard Model -- our best or "least bad" explanation for the nature and behavior of matter -- that hasn't been observed empirically yet.
But physicists are still not 100% sure that it is the Higgs boson.
He doesn't doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson as predicted by the Standard Model.
New data released this week during the big physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but we still don't have all the data to be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume that it's the Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems to be small, and let's look at what's really going on.
There is a law in this world that is absolutely unquestionable, that no two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - that "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It further divides particle physics into two categories.
On the one hand, we find the orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently follow Pauli's principle.
And at the other end of the spectrum are bosons, mean anarchists who don't value anything at all -- certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups by the device (which is absolutely amazing, by the way) called The Particle Adventure, at Berkeley Labs: mesons, which we'll leave unnoticed here, and "force particles", which spread great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
But it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic as one might think.
If you are reading this article, it is because of an unusually common boson: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of the electromagnetic force.
When charged particles accelerate or change direction, they "disrupt" the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - one of the bosons, "carriers of force".
More stable field
So it's the same with the Higgs boson, except that to "disturb" it takes another field, the Higgs field, for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; it needs to reach very high energy levels to be excited, much like the frozen surface of a pond, which only a very large bowl will erode.
So it's necessary to use a particle accelerator as big as the one at CERN - a large hadron accelerator with a 27 km radius of tangent rings! - to develop this energy.
The electromagnetic field analogy is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or materials react to an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do that, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand alone on a refrigerator.
And it's also true that not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have some mass, while the others (like the photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research, what does it "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a validation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
And there are not a lot of physicists who literally wish they could find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space for "new physics" and fill in some of the gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model is still very flawed, providing no explanation for gravity (wow!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's mass (wow again!).
But until now, CERN has not found such contradictions.
The answer
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr and Mrs Novákov is very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be none.
Look, back in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers at Bell Labs had no idea of the revolution their work would bring.
They were expecting scientific applications, but nothing more.
The physicist Willard Boyle -- who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam -- the previous beams were pulsed -- in 1962, I've said it before -- the laser was initially thought of as a sort of "laboratory toy".
Just imagine that.
And, moreover, the application can also stem from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle invented a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't originally plan it that way, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world, and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that the activities around the LHC have to change our lives, but it does mean that you never really know...
Palliative care is the best way to go out of life.
Through its Commission on Dying with Dignity, Quebec has recently become involved in the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly, and a bill is being prepared at the same time.
Much work remains to be done in this vital area.
Le Devoir magazine has tried to look at this question in more detail.
Not even a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monteregio.
The prostate cancer that was eating him gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years to live, and it's seven", he says emotionally from his bed in the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this", he adds.
The disease has done its work: the extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to go to the bathroom or to eat alone.
He resignedly looks at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees that we help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer to bathe.
The courage to die a simple death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of this diarrhea, it humiliates me", he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"All through life you learn that men are pissed off", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Going back to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person", says a psychologist, "whether he will accept the return.
According to many in the field of palliative care, the key moments are at the heart of such a return.
Patients who come to Victor-Gadbois palliative care home, they all have cancer.
Their prognosis is three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses caring for them do not provide so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is dying "asphyxiated in full consciousness".
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no more wishes in life", she says, and then she allows us to put her on a breathing apparatus.
Yet, she is looking forward to the final visit of her son from Italy in the days ahead.
The Victor-Gadbois home, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, provides nutrition-based body care.
This is what palliative care looks like when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one palliative care bed is needed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, they can be given a sip of brandy or pepsi, depending on their taste.
Diabetics no longer have to watch their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they delivered beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son is finishing a beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as well as their loved ones", says Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, days go by, but they don't look alike.
Next to the 93-year-old man, who is enjoying a final reunion with his family, carefully laid out on pillows, while they toast him in his honor, a 34-year-old man dies tragically surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after trying every possible chance to survive.
"For six months now, there are three to five beds available for people with cancer under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel, who is concerned.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering once a patient reaches the final stage of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Home Palliative Care Society of the Greater Montreal Area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that has many palliative care physicians fearful of the passage of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulated signed by leading palliative care practitioners, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, expressing their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure that all persons have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be authorized.
She says she recently saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ER in excruciating pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He's worried that patients might not ask to be put to death because they're not getting proper care.
At the same time, many oncologists care for their patients to the last minute despite adverse prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the challenging chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she said she regretted that I was quitting fighting, she told us.
And she was telling me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their doctors for not granting their wishes when a team of palliative care nurses relieved their pain.
But it must be said that palliative care is not the all-powerful way to treat pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of the Greater Montreal Area, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either by accident or by continuous sedation.
We can't pretend we don't see this part of suffering.
A patient who doesn't get rid of the pain will have more and more access to palliative care.
Patients who are not given sedatives always say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia", it means "I want you to take away my pain".
This report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about the amazing "system" that mixes construction, government officials, politicians, trade unions, and the mafia.
This "sector" came to Quebec taxpayers very dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has broken down since we took drastic measures", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
It led to a scandal in 2011 over a thorough investigation into money laundering in connection with road construction contracts in Quebec, which was approved after long delays by then-Liberal Quebec Premier Jean Charest.
The Duchesneau report confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of government officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010", he says, "the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars in contracts" when some people restrained their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau commission, which "resigned two mayors", hopes to "expose the cunning of some people", he adds.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
And the "Marteau" police, who since 2009 have ensured that the Montreal "money cartel" has significantly reduced the inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged with fraud and corruption a number of city councilors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban community.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have also been filed against Montreal transport engineers and Italian-born businessmen such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when he explained to the Commission the mechanism of the "system" of procurement.
He himself gave 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal during those years to a mafia-linked intermediary who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, donating more than C$88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals, who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Cash flow contracts for which he over-priced
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, described it in great detail before the committee: over a period of ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to field trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and $736,000 in pocket money in exchange for overpriced cash contracts.
Other public transport officials admitted that they had been paid rewards for overvaluing invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-tasking.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of blinking at a concurrent budget that brought dirty money into his coffers.
Based on these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first members of the Montreal legislature to issue a warning.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, she's been opposing the sale of municipal land since 2010 after it was purchased for $5 million and sold for... $1.6 million to developers right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will finally begin, he says that he is "pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the fostered ant system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
She says the process is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need to set up our own investigation team in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices do not return.
Like when he's cleaning up.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the parliamentarians informed of this plot" if they do not get involved in these schemes!
He estimates that 70 percent of Quebec's campaign finance comes from dirty money, and ironically adds: "I've heard that this is just a faint glimpse of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but it says that will not solve the problem: "As long as electoral spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics".
He proposes a comprehensive control of the procurement and party financing system: "We cannot go any lower; if we focus boldly on the bottom line, we can build again on a stronger foundation and with more control and compliance with the law".
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that anyone who mocks him look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You and PSG have set a whole new pace this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone into each other, or by a completely new dimension of the PSG.
We've got some great players here.
Every day I get closer to them.
The tech team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the bar.
And it's easier when you're in a fight.
Things go by so fast in football.
I'm not losing my head.
From my first days in training at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always progressed by degrees.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
This summer's reinforcements are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
And it means that a player like me has a greater appetite for the game and wants to give it his best.
And besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in connection with my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the final say at the right time?
Of course I did.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
He's second to none in the Premier League and one of the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience and he's won a lot of titles with top teams.
He's worked with some great players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring interview with him in January.
I've had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason I'm so good.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
Lyon has taken our lead in the Premier League.
We're still in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the semi-finals very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for the top European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group against Port first so we can play in the rematch of the semi-finals at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
The budget's already on...
Paris is a great European club. They have to win titles and go down in history.
Not yet.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to make this a reality.
And would it be a big failure not to win the Premier League like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were in a position to win.
We had a great season.
We got 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're the clear champion...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even better season.
I think we can do it this year.
Even if there are big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given the investment and the players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something in the paper that blames us, it's not very pleasant.
One wonders what more people can ask of you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
It takes time to build a team.
We proved in the Champions League that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who have missed the playoffs for the second straight season, and they've invested a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, you'd be expected to have a 15-point lead over the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, who didn't do well last season, have moved on to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how awesome the big leagues are.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It seems that PSG is relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for everything.
It's good to hear there's a "Zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is very efficient and he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and he's proving he's a major league star.
Everywhere he went, he proved he was a great player, a world star.
We respect the man and the player on our team.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he's accomplished is truly extraordinary.
This led the others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow alongside him.
How was Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's like a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to an injury, I couldn't play as well as I'd hoped.
But I've been through it, and I've come out stronger.
I'm still playing good games today.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps' first months at the helm of the national team?
The results speak for themselves.
We're in a good spot in the MS qualifiers.
Coach is selective, he's close to the players, and he can get excited about winning.
That's what Laurent Blanc was like.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps leads our team to Brazil.
Is the 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16 a solid starting point?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks.
The total amount of the eligible own funds to meet SCR-Tier 1 of the consolidated T2 capital of the undertaking.
And as is often true of these technologies, there is a clear political perspective: the belief that the current financial system, built on banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both virtual money (convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between pairs of partners.
Some 200 000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network.
About a thousand websites already accept Bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price first peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, and is now at about $10 (see bitcoincharts.com for a list of prices).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, it's nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was released in October.
Bitcoin is referred to as "the most successful virtual money", "a competitor to the dollar and the euro", and "the era of ordinary money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like a "credit" used for a video game progression, which one gains by playing or which one can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, each month the central authority checks and processes the individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are the depositors of the current account book, the controllers, the issuers of money, and the buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses via e-mail.
However, the user may choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
The information set relating to this transaction shall be electronically signed by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
The content of the file further ensures that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public ledger of current accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to record this new transaction in this ledger.
It's done by solving a mathematical problem given to the computers, and the solver, some kind of temporary central banker, will have the right to fill in this extra line.
This is the phase of file cutting; that is, transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
The computers "take" this new transaction and add a number to it, only to "cut" the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a specific print (a lot of zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction is then indelibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the print.
If a user wants to pay twice with the same money very quickly in a row (up to ten minutes) for fraudulent purposes, the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be omitted because each has a different footprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided regularly in two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but it can be divided by 100 millionths, so there's room for margin here...
The difficulty of the task also increases with increasing computational levels.
The network has had its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The gap in usage is not related to the protocol itself", assures Pierre Noizat, founder of Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also monitors the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the same problem applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia are rejecting gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, are embracing them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the ledger of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, the "giant discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to convert bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who also authored a textbook on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (with real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions, which makes them cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily configurable at dealerships where no new terminals or software need to be installed.
Just give the address, which can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who claims he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement towards challenging hierarchical systems and towards more horizontal systems.
"It's going to be a while before Bitcoin takes hold, but 2013 could be the deciding year", he predicts.
In addition, the ECB's report envisages a reassessment of the various risks which are currently considered to be heightened if this type of money is to succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US troops should follow by the end of 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The worst damage was done to the people in the Afghan countryside, who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all the wounds and mutilations.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often they are rural people who reject the presence of foreign troops as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they've been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They now experience tolerance and frequent support from local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will diminish.
The departure of French troops from the Nijerb base, which I watched from the peaks of the almond-covered mountains thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul unharmed with helicopter air escort.
The Taliban will no longer be as active in Kabul as they were in late 2014.
The conditions have changed considerably since their unstoppable run in 1994-96.
Kabul was empty at the time and the land was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between different resistance groups.
Their taking over the land was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these villagers, who were completely controlled by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation did not improve until our time.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are all in agreement in their efforts to keep women in a subordinate position.
The top officials from the war against the Soviets returned to power in 2001.
They became dealers, seizing state land, selling it as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and using huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They've been discredited; most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have benefited from American generosity do: capital flight is substantial.
Young people are tired of war and the ideology that goes with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they were introduced to the modern world and were fascinated by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full, both girls and boys.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they do not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some officials.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series showing the modern world are everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that will rise to its head be considered legitimate?
Some former commanders of the anti-Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias, which will be beyond the control of the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong local identity, should have enjoyed a certain degree of decentralization, following the pattern of Western states, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially in the run-up to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been restored, no dam is functioning, no major irrigation system is being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
Private initiative is preferred.
In a country ravaged by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be essential.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had vast mineral wealth.
And that just reinforced the feeling that the Western powers were only here to take it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground and without the means to transport the raw materials across the mountains, however, no mining can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and have left international archaeological teams (backed by the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist site to preserve their role as the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend on a large part of their imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls' and boys' lycées, French-language departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "win-win-win-win" initiative has been working, attempting to combine aid and military activities in an arduous task, with the Ministry of Defence's "civil-military steps" service (Cimic) which was disbanded in 2012, but thanks to a number of French NGOs, has achieved a number of successes in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction measures in dozens of mining villages.
These works, involving many local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and expansion of arable land.
What kind of memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often above 2 000 m above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, these farmers want to obtain a small amount of civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affect them.
The difficult work of the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided country in history, with a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has chosen to play the role of a pawn.
On Wednesday, he announced that, despite everyone else's opinion, the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the day after tomorrow.
Less than a week ago, the head of state gave the assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been amended many times, which undermines the country's constitutional stability and leads to legal disputes.
This new initiative only reinforced the country's division.
From the opposition's point of view, the president continues in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "break his word" and "trample on the law".
But its supporters assure that it is a means to quickly turn around the constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
It's a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to back down from its intention to explain the text to the Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it's also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the country is roiled by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American magazine Time, Muhammad Morsi seems confident that the Egyptians will vote for him.
Especially since this hastily organised vote is putting the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text or I will keep my unlimited powers", which would otherwise end with the adoption of the new constitution.
And in this particular atmosphere, yesterday, 85 members of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was proclaimed, they knocked on the door saying they had no chance to enforce their views.
Human rights activists, civil society, and members of religious minorities have emulated their steps.
To achieve tolerability, 11 of the replacement ranks were rushed in yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, articles of the constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators further pondered that one of the few disputes that day revolved around... the prayer hour, when some committee members felt that the hours in the meeting room were not properly arranged.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains consistent with the 1971 version of the constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the key requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the rest of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", object liberals, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
They say the Islamization of the constitution is done through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers on al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular on the question of the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "those who are called upon to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginning of theocracy".
The concerns of liberals are further fuelled by the fact that the next university president should be less moderate than the current one.
"There has been no concrete religious impact so far.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulama, but university workers, many of them graduated from French schools", says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a paper on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be some contradictions in the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used therein are part of the religious vocabulary.
There is a particular reference to "fiqh".
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this".
The text approved yesterday is highly criticized, apart from the religious aspects, because of the expanded powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in their numbers compared to the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers vested in the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the army, the audit of the defence budget will not be carried out by parliament but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, the civil trial will not be prohibited in military courts, as the Human Rights Association has demanded.
The association expresses its doubts about the text, which it considers to be anti-freedom.
The criminal offence of blasphemy is maintained and insulting is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, none of the articles address women's protection, points out Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
She says the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to give a televised address last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the belly button of the world and the sea of saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comforts, and the untouched nature.
AaF has identified the top five reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping Sacred Places
To visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that God's mercy will descend upon all who enter this "bath".
And Galilee - the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming a storm, and filling nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But the most sacred places are in Jerusalem.
Here believers walk the Way of Sorrows, or Jesus' Way of the Cross (Via Dolorosa in Latin).
It begins at the Fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial was held, passes through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, the anointing stone, and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian world umbilicus, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem was built on the spot where, according to Christian legend, the tree grew from which they made the cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various faiths leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take the road vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remain from a secret refuge from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C. for his family.
The wreckage is located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are involved in mountaineering can reach it on their own.
The rest will take the cable car to this historic mountain.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600 to 2,040 meters, is the famous Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists during the winter months.
A shuttle bus takes tourists from the foot of the hill to this ski paradise.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, the mountain was said to be the home of pagan gods.
Visiting a unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, which is located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
The exhibition is widely represented by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Baths Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with figures of bath users and bath nurses of the time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the sculptures of Dalí and Rodén.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and gifts are strictly rejected.
The fifth museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem, in Tel Aviv - tells the story of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in, and you're in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they say the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improving Your Health
Israel's three main spa centers are spread along the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of these has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is a good place to swim in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest point on the planet - 417 meters below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated saline solution that is easy to keep afloat even for people who cannot swim.
The scenery is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to get a treatment using salt water, brine, and medicinal mud, which can treat medical problems like dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal your damaged nerves.
Touch the mysterious past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the small town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through them.
Mentions of this city are found in the earliest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, tourists love to wander through narrow lanes named after the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, luck will be favorable.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries to have their picture taken.
And in Caesarea, King Herod's city, you can walk through the Roman theater and "capture" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take along money, not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
The city's main means of transport are buses, but Jerusalem is served by a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
It's basically a subway cable car.
Traveling by all forms of public transport costs 6 shekels, which means you can drive 1.5 hours with a transfer.
In Israel, the Sabbath is observed according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transportation are closed.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants, and hotels, you will only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, shellfish, and foods containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, a variety of sauces, ground chickpeas - falafel, fruit, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
There are, however, many well-fed kittens that gracefully "wander about according to their tastes".
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The leading cats love crowded places and indulge in every kind of goodness with gusto.
Car rental will cost from $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the make of the car.
Plus insurance, $15 a day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets are on average 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The largest number of visitors came from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The number of Ukrainian tourists visiting the Promised Land from January to October 2012 was 118,8 thousand, 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver of 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" announces to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While MPs and human rights activists are still debating the compulsory language test law, scammers have already appeared in the country selling "fake" certificates
Each year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support their families at home.
On December 1, a law came into force that requires every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
For the time being, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the service, housing and communal, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, the FMS promises that in time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Proof of language proficiency will also be required for obtaining and renewing a work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is an official language.
People who successfully achieved certification and an academic diploma before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also not subject to this law.
Use, conviction and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the exam in any city; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to promote the introduction of testing was also supported by the State Duma and the FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law came into force, human rights activists were able to ask the question in the press many times: What will it really bring?
What changes the obligation to know the language for Russians and for visitors themselves?
First of all, the immigration officials answer, it will reduce the number of people who suffer as a result of "slave labor".
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with unskilled, uneducated, unlanguageable and unmedicated immigrants.
Without knowledge of the language, the prospective migrant is doomed to clash with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "pass" to the horrible, cramped hostels where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've been getting a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"They are promised one thing in their country, but when they arrive they are cheated, their passports are confiscated, they are not paid the wages they were promised", confirms the head of the Tajik Central Administration for Labour Migration, Ms. Tolib Sharipov.
Don't you dare!
Not least because many Central Asian citizens who intend to go to Russia to work admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are going to but also have no experience in the job.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as their misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least an adequate basic education.
Their families also need to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, groomed, and equipped for school.
As children reach productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without the language, it's hard, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
True, with regard to the language test law, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will only be done on those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't be able to take the exam or get any other official job.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry is prohibited".
Many of the newly arrived workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
Legalisation also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officials know we have essentially false documents, no registration, and that's what blackmail is.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea", Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov told reporters about his experience.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that it was not only migrants' registration documents that were falsified.
FMS employees have already confiscated several fake language test pass certificates.
The forged documents are printed on a normal colour printing press.
Of course, they did not come to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the test, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more than passing the official test: it will cost migrant workers 3,000 rubles.
The main task in the near future is to secure the system against corruption so that workers cannot simply buy documents, according to government officials and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the government may promise foreign workers who fail the tests the first time the time needed to complete a basic course in Russian.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legally owned weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is proposing tougher laws on civilian gun ownership.
It is a response by the government authorities to recent events: the shooting at a wedding that went without victims and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age at which a gun can be licensed from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared online, in which the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanded the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, in an interview with the BBC Russian News.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 firearms offences registered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs were committed in the first six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the legislation on civilian weapons will not force the perpetrator to go to the "black" market.
According to them, nowadays, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baraniec, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept orders for weapons
The first is "military or military route", meaning a weapon stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by Caucasians themselves", says Lamb.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from law enforcement officials.
Ramenez explains that this includes theft from police stores and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "mainly" get into the market from military warehouses.
Explosions are common in many military warehouses.
"It has been proven that some fires were set deliberately - to cover up the mania", says a former soldier.
Barance says the weapons manufacturers are also contributing.
"Private arms companies are now being formed that are not competitive on the international market, and they are dumping the weapons they supply on the black market, including Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and automatic weapons come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes guns are made in small factories, and the mafia has formed to organize their smooth production", explains a former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
The experts have calculated the approximate share of the sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Planning in Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Statistical Office, as well as criminal literature and data from public data portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market "are the fault of government officials whose work is linked to weapons", says the report.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons, 5% are "black archaeology".
A sales consultant at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, believes that the weapons found in the black "archaeologists" excavations have long since been discarded - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, the salesmen go for new shipments directly to the military warehouses.
The lieutenant will buy a unit, like a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros apiece with two containers", he says.
"The truth is that the police are well-versed, so whenever they get a plan to solve crimes, they will do a check-purchase from illegal arms dealers", the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I was visiting websites and blogs until a guy came along and offered me the opportunity to go to the "Testing Room" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the "corner" where we would interact.
I learned the price mainly there
Military reporter Viktor Baraniec
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, says the salesman - the advisor. - I have such an acquaintance, but I don't fully trust him.
The vendors at the market are, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to report that his daughter had a tooth falling out".
And now I'm getting there through a man I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraniec tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-90s, when he was working on a story to be published on the subject.
The schematics, he said, haven't changed.
They gave him a photo album with "everything you could think of".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to the Lamb, is not offered a bunny in a bag - you can try everything.
I, the potential client, just don't buy -- we go into the woods with the salesman and we set ourselves a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the gun is firing well, we start acting", describes the expert.
The supply on the couch
Search engines on the Internet will take you to websites and groups on "Vkontakte", where you are offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No paperwork or face-to-face meetings are needed.
"Just have a certain amount of money", says the headline on the website, "Buy a combat pistol or machine gun".
Users leave comments and ask questions on these pages.
And the sale to minors?
"Of course, without a license", asks the user "Ivan" (the copyright is preserved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - this is the short form of the demand "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently shut down a vast network of hacked websites, and individuals who wish to purchase a military weapon can scoop it up with a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to the bait and then they conquer the coal in Siberia.
Military Intelligence and Senior Military Officer Viktor Baraněc
I've heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment by ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden", said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to Gun.
Viktor Lamb confirms that once you place an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and end up behind bars.

"People rush like hungry fish to the bait and then they conquer coal in Siberia", he confirms.
I 'm going to buy you a $100 noodle .
When you buy an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO Right to Gun, you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You'll have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is shipped from the stockpile for long-term storage through the mid-article stockpile.
According to the Official Statistics Office, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% compared to the period January-October 2011 to 22,900 cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices solved decreased by 7,8%.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
A quarter of all American teenagers will go through a McDonald's cashier job.
In recent days, a wave of low-wage protests has erupted in the United States at Walmart supermarkets and at popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or whether it is destined to end soon.
The whole action is supported by the unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries of ordinary workers at Walmart and fast food systems, the protest organizers are aiming to get them to form their own unions.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, engulfing millions of residents and in some cases even resulting in fights.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces to protest alongside labor unions and left-wing activists from multinational chain stores whose products are targeted at the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners and eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only shop at their workplace.
The availability and variety of products made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
Critics say that Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply in part because it pays its employees too little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic wheelchairs or handheld scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had risen sharply from $30 to $100 per month.
The typical Walmart worker earns $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't match the amount of spending, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That's on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart were to shift the pay rise entirely onto the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store would cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers will spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's defense team points out that the protest was only in nine countries and would cause virtually no harm to the company.
Black Friday in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its treasuries conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post, company spokesman Dan Fogelman said that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had quit their jobs and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the unions.
"Unoccupied box office!"
Protests continued this week in New York City, where they targeted not Walmart stores (they are not very popular in that progressive city, so they are almost nonexistent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says they sell billions of servings, and then they don't even pay you sick leave and pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage for labor under federal law and New York state regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only moderately, and their regular workers in New York City are getting an average of $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive town gets a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
McDonald's will employ nearly a quarter of the American teenagers who work part-time behind the counter after school and live with their parents.
Few see it as their main source of income or plan to stay there for long.
I'm constantly interviewing McDonald's employees today, who complain that they have to live off of this money, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there's a commentary on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks in fast-food establishments start earning at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be set up in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the formation of trade unions and punishing activists of the trade union movement by harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, the introduction of trade union organisation in fast food establishments is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of staff.
Disagree
Noisy protests were also held in a number of other Manhattan cheap restaurants that day.
The climax of the event was a noon gathering at the McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, most notably City Councilman Jumaane Williams, spoke up and said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then it doesn't even pay you sick leave and it doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The protesters also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must stand together in support of fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay for their work and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But only a few hundred people attended, though not all of them were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York City.
Whether this event will become a spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement is still unclear.

Among fans of modern VR technology, augmented reality is a popular theme; lately, it means seeing the world primarily through the lens of special glasses.
At its annual conference earlier this year, Google presented a working model for this innovation, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
An interview with Sharam Izadi, head of the Cambridge Interactive 3D Technology Group at Microsoft Labs, shows that for the scientists at Microsoft, glasses are a thing of the past.
What's appealing is the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with your bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in a frame, what is your research group doing?
- We're dealing with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of that interaction.
Humans have so far been stuck in the pixel-on-flat-screen stage, at most sometimes touching the screen with your finger.
We want to look forward to five to ten years and predict significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors -- that's a step forward, and almost no Xbox is on the market today without Kinects, because it's a very interesting gesture control option for everyone.
- What's the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has brought interaction to the physical level, a lot of interaction still happens on flat screens, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not improved much.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projection.
We need to bring the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
However, to do this, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It certainly cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others around us about our activities and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of computer interactions are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not big ones, just these little ones, short ones.
The gesture would not be captured by a camera device, but by a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
It's big so far, but theoretically, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
Generally, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How did you do that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to tell.
So you want to get the user to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a bonding.
I think in the near future, we're going to have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can detect human reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, which provide a fairly good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically the current generation -- that's what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's like the matrix and the depth.
So, in the present view, all the current technologies are not enough for us -- that's a lot of work for the algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also the Z axes.
So, the speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are quite a bit, frankly, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes at our Redmond lab has made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, whereas current mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me, the equivalent of this device would be very useful in my work, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some extra snapshots.
- And the increase in the number of cameras is not necessary?
- The Kinect system now uses three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera -- this is actually a standard visual sensor.
It's not used to determine the depth of an object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse, because it would increase the amount of computation required.
It would be nice to build a flexible analog Kinect system, play around with the curvature of the camera position, and see how that helps with three-dimensional positioning.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly showcase their glasses.
Don't you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around with your smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think the most powerful option would be a portable form of augmented reality, where you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection screen, and so on, at any time, based on a cloud platform.
Glasses - they're very personal devices, that's their strength (you're the only one who can see private things), and also their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses doesn't allow you to work on virtual objects simultaneously with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but to ordinary mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
My hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing to this challenge?
- I often say in my lectures that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think that the addition of tactile sensing could very well be the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the other hand as a kind of backdrop for visualization.
It's a great way to record compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibleness to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is, it produces a tactile sensation, but it's still very faint - as if you were blowing on the belly of your fingers.
There's also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think he feels what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time to come - how to make a person who is physically in a very confined space believe that he is walking in an open, virtually infinite space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If fooling the brain becomes the goal, then the job is many years away.
That's what makes working in virtual reality so appealing to researchers -- a lot of things are in the very early stages.
The taste of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "Petersburg Avant-garde" project, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront of the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already the major figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving pan-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosebalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, the bearded man, dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here at the fashion houses and at the vernices.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, the creator of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - that's a remarkable man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
Besides being a city man, his appearance on the streets brings a smile to the faces of the citizens, raises everyone's spirits.
He recently took up the bottle and became a St. Petersburg bottler, having matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why are you walking around town in red and not yellow or turquoise?
I chose red as a designer's color for appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the imager and the public.
Although, generally speaking, anything that differs slightly from gray is aggressive and evokes bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at establishing a conversation.
My entire history of provocative acts is primarily an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
And then the wave of old unofficial freelance artists came along, and the new, freelance artists, I couldn't understand.
I made friends with the new wave artists, the post-Gazonev artists, who brought us to Pushkin 10, and there were no more waves.
I'm drawn to theater, to dress, to music, to all genres except words.
- And all this came together in your art-clinic... - It was important to me to be in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should gather.
In 1995, I took a position at Pushkin 10, and there was a music and art club there before the reconstruction, a bohemian club, home of the St. Petersburg bohemians.
There were many things born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember when they brought in the String with the Van Gogh's Ear project.
Snor and his friends sang under the patch of light songs, dressed in fitting shirts, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg has run many programs of the Hali-Gali era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, so his great career began, basic education and training he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - that is the echo of Art Clinic.
This is the way our workers and our regular guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture was still important.
In 2000, a survey was organized and was in the press, the special award was "People in Our Town".
I was nominated for "Artist of the Year", and that was the end of my high.
In the new age, old-fashioned work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in this day and age, but culture and popularity are two different things now, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your work is characteristic in a recognizable way.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, capturing the timeliness and the insight.
I'm having a program exhibition called "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, but now it's painful and terrible.
But clowns are all about wiping, filming tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have the grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian disguise in order.
People today are meeting by clothing, oriented to the outer mechanics, not the inner man.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the delusion will be removed by the disguise.
- We saw you recently as the city's bottler. - A cultural city should have a hero like that.
And who should be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There's a breakdown of cultures.
People used to get together in groups, love one thing, love another.
Today everything has broken down into micro-companies, it's very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everybody.
Today is about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And the Stasi Mikhailov will be attended by several thousand spectators!
- He's got the fans coming for him, and that's where the sexual-social sphere comes in.
And 300 people come to the cultural land and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, less money, everything rots.
I have fans, the important thing is that no one deceives them and violates what they've experienced.
When I was young, I painted these pictures that hung on the wall of a collector's house with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings that people usually end up with.
People are often confused these days.
They say, "spiritual culture, consumer culture".
There's no consumer culture, it's from somewhere else.
I'm a man of culture from yesterday, raised by the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money for painting.
And I'm for that culture.
- Cyril, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There's a concept: an official through culture.
Not all of them can do culture.
It wasn't like that in all the real Tsars, the Tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that they needed to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're stuck in the corner, because we need great experts who can properly evaluate these experts and point them in the right direction.
Today, the taste of the language is thriving.
The same thing, Erart, but they're different in that they're honestly saying that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - it's not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our corner, art is a miserable thing.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers than readers today, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
We're just a little thin on that.
We need art to become a fashion issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by the St. Petersburg grant
To be born in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with Earthlings aboard are set out, searching for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question is: How do we keep our kind in weightless conditions or on a given alternate planet?
I don't think the choice is too great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be colonized, even if only hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars", says Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P. K. Sternberg State Institute for Astronomy.
While life is more favorable on Mars, temperatures on the surface of Venus reach 500 degrees Celsius.
Life is only possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists have begun to solve the problems of reproduction in the universe with flora.
Experiments on plants have been conducted for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their Earth relatives.
Then an insect was put into orbit - the very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, a cranberry egg was sent into space to test the development of an embryo in a weightless state.
We get a perfectly normal bird at the exit.
But then the trouble starts.
"The problem is that this bird has to find support, get on its own feet and start moving", says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IBMP) of the RAN.
If they cannot find support, the birds fall chaotically and make a roar.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds had a complete loss of instinct.
The birds didn't respond to light or sound.
And the problem was, they just died in four days.
"Twice we had the birds hatch, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them", comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the chicken experiment in space.
The last miniarch with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
But in Bion, there will only be beings of one sex.
An experiment was done on rats that were already pregnant when they were sent into space.
They didn't find anything supernatural there, basically.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be conducted", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the space rats had offspring.
But getting close to the problem of reproducing directly in space has not yet been possible.
It's a difficult task.
Animals that have lost their natural habitat simply cannot fulfill their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens dominate abstract thought and are able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was the Tereshkovs.
The most precious thing that mankind has is a woman's body.
Our teapot flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if it would survive a flight into space.
If she can have a baby after a flight like that.
"No one has answered that question yet", says veteran rocket-space expert Vachtang Vakhnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of another woman, cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space, was born.
But the risk remains.
We have a few astronauts who are born after many years and grow up healthy offspring.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights", says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet, humanity must inevitably seek new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolab is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero-gravity conditions, astronauts are learning the skills needed to work in open space.
Water is imitating weightlessness.
While water is a comfortable yet strange environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
The tiny ichtianders seem to confirm that life on Earth originated from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic fluid for an average of nine months and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
It's logical, in principle, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, only two weeks have passed.
"That's not much to make a child forget", says Marina Aksenov, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is more natural for a newborn baby, then inevitable gravity, the force of attraction, is more natural for women.
In the weightless state, the abdominal muscles, the pelvic muscles, shrink very quickly, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can put that aside if the stimulators work during labor.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism will expel the fetus.
"And what next?" asks Valery Polyakov, a man with a complex mind.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
Without the force of gravity, an organism cannot properly form a skeleton or muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed like an adult in a special weight suit to train in.
He'll simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to grow.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows a child to be born in an alien environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unaccustomed to the environment", predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAN bioethics committee.
So having babies in space is just a theoretical question today.
But one day, the time will come when it will become a reality and when the people of Earth will sail in their ships to a distant planet that will become the home of their spacemen-born offspring.
Head of the NCC: Control of the corruption system failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good controls and good legislation on public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the vice president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, said this.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - that's what I think we're missing", Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also drawn from the joint audit of the Czech and German auditors.
As an example of misconduct, he cites Peter Neczas' approach to the so-called "swart system".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS will not bother businessmen with its controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"After all, the law has to be set up, and if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the office from doing its job of checking and enforcing", Kala observes.
At the audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the public procurement legislation in both countries was compared.
What was the point?
It's a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public procurement is handled, followed by national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the control is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences - in general terms, the legislation may be "harder and more perfect" here, but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but that the application of the law itself is needed.
What does this project actually do for you, what does it do for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help to stop the effort to clarify the laws, to reduce and improve the limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means to get the right thing for a reasonable (but not always lowest) price, so as to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But by lowering the order limit, we may not necessarily achieve that.
Maybe the system will be so overwhelmed with paper that those who want to look for holes in the system will find it much easier to draw from it than if the limit were higher.
You are talking about the domestic problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is this office similar to our NCO, or is it set up differently?
As for the authorities, like the NCA, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organized in the same way as us, also has a college, only it is formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but because Germany is a federal state, the accounting courts are also at the level of the individual federal states - a system which differs somewhat from ours.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country is state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounting Courts.
As for the legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is often cited as a model, but it is not certain that it is better in all respects.
So does it have to be because they have better controllers?
I'm sure you don't, but I'm telling you again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it should be said that even the countries we consider to be role models face a whole host of challenges.
Otherwise, there's no point in working with our office, is there?
As regards the national legislation, what has been the effect of the amendment of the Public Procurement Act for your office?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the control measures.
Since we do ex post checks, there's a certain amount of delay to be expected.
We are only seeing this in the process of preparing future checks - we have launched our new tool "detection of uneconomic risks" through which we have searched and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - where, of course, the changes will be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures will be adjusted and so on.
So, do you see the passage of this bill as a benefit or as an additional burden on the bureaucracy?
I think this bill is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it's confirmed.
The problem that can arise is that the rules will become "tougher" and it will be impossible to follow them.
Under the previous rules, the controlled persons are already obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth making the law more stringent?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal error that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
How do you get out of it?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not harass businessmen with the controls of the so-called "swinger system" - and what does that mean?
Is the screw system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be set up, and if it prohibits something, then even the prime minister cannot prevent the work of the office that has the duty to inspect and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it", but he can't say we'll do nothing.
The Public Procurement Act has fairly strict rules on what is to be formally implemented - which is correct in order to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified for mere formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - that's what I think we're missing.
The roads are frozen, but mostly slippery
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowed.
But the roads are mostly downhill, with some increased caution.
The Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were paved this morning, but the places were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, but it's expected to warm slightly during the day.
Snow has stopped in the region and there are only faint layers in the lowlands.
However, the crests of the Crusher Mountains are covered with about 12 inches [30 cm] of snow.
There were also places where visibility was reduced due to fog, according to the county highway patrol.
The R6 motorway and first class communications are now open to traffic in the region without restriction.
However, caution is needed, for example, on some bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also open for use.
But in some places, the ice and snow still remain.
In particular, higher positions require increased attention to driving.
The Pardubice and the Královéhrade region
On some roads in eastern Czechia, frost is threatening, and at higher elevations and in the mountains, the roads may be covered in snow, the Directorate of Roads and Highways informs on its website.
Drivers are being warned about frost, which can occur especially in the higher parts of Pardubice.
The findings may be in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoký Mýt, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated I/43 and I/34 roads at Svitav.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orlik Mountains.
The snow cover is at the highest points on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemian lands, it is usually clear to plain without rainfall.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a slight breeze.
The Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are open this morning, but places with increased caution and driving must be adapted to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below freezing.
So, after the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The driver has to deal with fog, but visibility will improve gradually.
It's from the information from the county highway patrol.
The D5 is almost unrestricted, but traffic managers recommend extra caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads are dry and frozen.
But there may be frozen sections in southern Plzeň and Tachov.
The second and third class communications are wet and also in this case the frozen section warning applies.
Drivers should be especially careful on less busy roads in the Schumacher region.
The Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest points of Olomouc region must expect snow today.
After the chemical spill, she stayed on the Red Mountain Saddle and on the road towards Videlsky Cross.
The snow forced the road workers out of the area at night, and according to the authorities, about three centimeters of snow fell in Šumperska.
In other parts of the country, the roads are mostly open to traffic without restrictions.
"On the summit of the mountain, the snow is still in the air.
With snow on the Red Mountain ridge, drivers must count on the direction of Jeseník", said the dispatcher of the Šumper roads administration today.
Their colleagues at Jesenicka were also out in the field at night, and the roads to the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after the chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are unrestricted, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forested sections where the road remains wet.
The Republic of Serbia
Several difficult-to-travel spots are reported this morning by road users in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice on Ústeck is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are below zero even at lower altitudes, so ice and snow are likely to hold up on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Czech Central Highlands, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No operational complications have been reported.
The ice sheet is reported by road users, especially from the area around Šěť.
Weathermen said the conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and snowfall during the day, light and cold at night.
Adverse conditions are also reported from the main routes on the I/13 road on the border between the Ústecký and Liberecký regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by the curved branches of the trees, which were bent under the snow to the road.
Shimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the world ending in less than a month?
It's just another one of those scary news stories that we humans like to grab.
We, the Tap Tap, are more of a joke, and we say that we're the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
And in December, you're going to do a very unique project, three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to the readers?
It's a national fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before December 20th, from 9pm, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time as the end of the Mayan calendar on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
I think it was my idea at first, then we came up with it with our artist Honza Augusta.
As well as trying to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about what kind of world we're going to pass on to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys to the end of the world that people can also support by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang a so-called anti-end of the world anthem called "End of the World Cancelled".
She's already a big hit on YouTube, is she gonna be playing at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and that's in the final analysis, which is if we do everything right and the world doesn't end...
It's sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also be connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
The lyrics of this song were written by and the main role of Jesus in the video is played by Tomáš Hanák, also singing in it Xindl X...
How did you get involved with them?
We also work with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, as we organize a lot of charity events and concerts...
We're trying to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What's the profit from the concerts going to be against the end of the world?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we are implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedličko Institute.
Students of the Jedličko Institute are regularly attended by lecturers and engaged in activities that are fun and interesting to them.
Students themselves don't have the means to pose as teachers, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedličko Institute, a separate building will be built in the future, where we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What did you pick them on?
We've been trying to put together a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be performances by Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For details, see www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombing actions" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we'd also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, once we're in the U.S., I'd like to connect that with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not minimalist, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of disabled people.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organisationally?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on an electric wheelchair, her wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage compartment, then we naturally drag a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far we have always been able to do it without any problems, and both the CSA and British Airways have been so well prepared for us that I have been amazed many times.
Even in Moscow, which we recently returned from, it was no problem.
Travel abroad allows you to compare how individuals differ in terms of accessibility, public access to the disabled, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than here, we have seen in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Moscow is very barrier-free compared to Prague, and it is still unusual for a person to travel in an electric wheelchair alone in the city center.
It doesn't even cover the obvious, like giving preference to wheelchair users in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civic organizations that are trying to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
And what are we still outmatching the more advanced countries in?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
But it's important to mention that improving and improving a situation always depends on the efforts of the people involved.
It's quite common in London and Madrid that even people with severe disabilities can move around in public, go to the toilet, to museums, anywhere...
But it's not very common for large numbers of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, and we're a bit ahead of the pack with The Tap Tap!
Public respect or openness is one thing, but only when we become great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers do things really start to change.
So far, these are rare cases of people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is a very popular band these days, but let's go back a few years, back in 1998, what made you start it?
I became an educator at the Jedličko Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people who were interested in doing something.
And since I'm a musician myself, playing saxophone, among other things, I started a music club with a colleague.
Well, as time went on, as our host, Lada Angelovich, says, it got a little out of hand. (Laughter)
But popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
True, it helped when we began to associate with well-known singers and also actively worked on promoting the band.
We realized that the work that we can't see, it's like it doesn't exist.
In addition, thanks to the European Union's contributions, we can afford quality tutors, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get the Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of things where one imitates the other.
It's kind of logical, everything new is taken care of and takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, pity, that's natural...
But that pity is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not all suffering abandoned beings that we have to pity.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that when something is done for people with disabilities, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society.
Did you also have a hand in this success by being a strict boss, as many people have called you?
If we want to do good work, we must be uncompromising in many respects and require a certain amount of discipline.
I mean, that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with romantic fantasies and with their heads in the clouds, and when they find they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend rehearsals and spend a lot of time traveling to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and that wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there when it started in 1998?
Only the one Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
If you have the will and the taste, we'll always have the door open
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012, at 9 p.m.
It will be held in Prague, Incheba Arena, Brno, and Ostrava Plynoye with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by a teleportation at the end of the evening, with the band singing "The End of the World Cancelled" by The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipping of the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedličkov Institute in Prague in the amount of 25 million CZK
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 are free at the Bohemiaticket pre-sale.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency ministers, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, the second from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and has participated in a number of ESA projects over the years.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had been exploring space before World War II, but they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, on December 6, 1933, in which he presented ideas from his pioneering work Introduction to Cosmonautics.
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his entry into spacecraft science in France.
The late Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned proponent of spaceflight, and his contributions were recognized by having one of the craters on the far side of the moon named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway dredge was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It's not even clear whether the missile was intended to be used to launch the drone or to slow it down.
Information about this drill is known only from the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to use rocket-propelled grenades.
The research was carried out by the Armament Technology Unit in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolf and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
It is clear from the archival material that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, the arrival of German troops interrupted the research.
In 1937, a photoelectric fighter rocket designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work Rakieta - aerial torpedo and aerial rocket-bomber by Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were dealt with by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity its activities were ended by the outbreak of war.
Further works devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of the company is in the November 1954 issue of Problemy, which contains four more extensive articles on astronautry.
One, by Professor M. Subotowicz, proposes the creation of a society for the study of spacecraft.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been seeking to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the autumn of that year, the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the very successful RM meteorological rocket (Raketa Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first flight took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile, with a range of 1,800 meters, was about 80 centimeters long and weighed less than 5 kilograms.
Later, improved versions of the RM-1A were built, and in the summer of 1959 two-stage RM-2 fighter rocket flight tests were started in the Bledova Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kilograms.
The next development type was to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 missile was to have a range of 14.5 km and its task was to monitor high-altitude winds.
However, in 1962 further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, 510 cm long, launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A had a capacity of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B had a capacity of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C had a capacity of 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aeronautics developed the Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 had a launch weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos program in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not the answer.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as in the globalised world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, coupled with unrestrained financial speculation.
The effect of significant differences in labour price (wages) is to create price tension.
This is the situation whereby a producer tries to compete by importing low-cost goods by 'betraying' the price of a competitor in order to gain a larger market share and thus increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means either moving production abroad, buying cheaply or disappearing for most entrepreneurs. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment it produces, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
The situation is compounded by the absolute reluctance of the businessmen to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage they have done to society in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to their own people regardless of social decline.
This is reflected in particular in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the price dictate of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other, by restrictions on workers' rights in the area of labour law.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between rich and poor.
In the FRG, there have been public food distributions for the poor who cannot support themselves by their own labour for many years.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for people in full employment to receive wages which the State must supplement to the subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal was also reported in the case of the auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU countries are undoubtedly leading to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social standards are forced either to emigrate as they did in the 19th century or to live on starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital will one day come to the country.
But the question is, where does it come from?
If it's from other EU countries, then poverty is either moving from one country to another or not coming at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African are still working for a fraction of European wages.
This is true for all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media are suffocating in their claim that the state cannot participate in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is adamant that the state must not intervene in the economy by means of managerial interventions.
Then we have to ask whether private capital does not influence, actually now control politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
The answer is definitely yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the area of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation where virtually everything is punishable but nothing is punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that, due to lack of funds, the State ministries entrust the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people as the Western-style constitutions proclaim, but from financially powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation described by Appiános in his Crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in complete disarray and the authorities were occupied by violence.
For bribes, for illegal favor-gathering, and for using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restraint and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."character people did not care at all for office, so that once as a result of this upheaval was a state without consuls for eight months"... .."It began to speak indeed that the only cure in a bad situation is self-government and that it is necessary to elect an energetic man".. Appianos though thought of Pompeii, but became Caesar, who changed democracy permanently into self-government.
Conclusion As in ancient times, today's society is based on the ruthless preference for self-interest over the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is no longer inherently capable of understanding and applying the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is now, as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite without any attempt at deeper reform.
The causal basis for the rise of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be found in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
At the present stage, the demise of these systems in favour of a liberal type of democracy can be seen as a certain pause in the expectation of the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity as we know them from old and new history.
Repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition both at international and intra-European level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways of further reducing the social standard of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is to implement targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: a lab of chaos.
"Nothing comes out of violence, and it never can". Sting in Fragile, whose main refrain is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no war".
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, a lot of reactions.
Some are for Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others are supporting the Palestinians, arguing for the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits into the role of the terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the culprit and who is the victim in the periodic waves of killing, after all, the people of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My aim is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, a glimpse of who is most served by the 95 years of tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by available historical facts, some of it is derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In any era, we can look for one of these Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomous in their actions, or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live in an age when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands one that could be considered the head of the octopus (if anyone else is standing above them, I don't know, but I can't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course I did.
They bought the first news agency, Reuters, in the 1890s to stop their name being associated with the high-level criminal acts they were behind, which they always thought meant consolidating power, multiplying wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and are fighting or preparing wars against countries where they do not have stakes in the central bank (before the invasion of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi it was only 4 countries, but meanwhile Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status of the Rothschild Bank of America, began issuing his own (understand the government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of the plan for three world wars between 1859 and 1871 by the 33rd degree Mason of the Supreme Order, Albert Peake.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial dominions of Great Britain in particular, and the third is to reduce the world population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (this number of slaves is enough for their comfort and luxury and does not consume so many resources), create one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prelude to such a solution), and finally take over absolute power.
The method that the group of the richest families led by the Rothschilds is working is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
But these solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED, to avoid a repeat of the crisis they provoked in 1907).
So after they succeeded in assassinating the Habsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo to start World War I, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended abruptly, militarily and economically unjustified, with the surrender of Germany (no longer needed for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the political bankers allowed a latent conflict situation to be created by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating the premise of the radicalization of the destitute masses, and then they had only to push the Germans with a sufficiently strong, guilty-indicating and simple solution offering a Leader and then by creating a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that was to play, and played, the role of the fifth column, in setting the war on fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier, set the stage for mass Jewish immigration to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler broke free from the chains that initially held him by international bankers, or whether all he did was plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps set the stage for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and like the war reparations Germany received in World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focus of World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, like the other, will be the victims on the front lines of the fighting, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also on an international scale (just consider how sharply people are divided into pro- and anti-Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where wrong breeds wrong in an endless chain of violence, when the origin of all this was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here, we need to distinguish the ordinary citizens of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers are pushing the people to choose their own candidates in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Haqqani Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, international banker-loyalist politician who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict and given Iran's control of the Strait of Hormuz, which carries 20% of all the world's oil (the waterway is only 2 miles wide) and destroys the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller now expressed in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The New World Order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the convenience of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes them a totally controlled being.
"And it makes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell except the one having the mark, that is, the name of the wild beast or the number of his name.
This is to understand: Let him who has understanding count the number of the beast.
That number represents a person, and it's the number six hundred and sixty-six".
When it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation offered no positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would have fundamentally compromised the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not achievable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by the failure of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debakl in Iran was a major contributor to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film, directed by Ben Affleck, Argo, describes an episode in history that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was seized, six employees escaped.
After a series of elaborate peripetries, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, working with Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film crew to scout the country for the location of a major science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, the film project was reported in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been classified, but the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, also called a "caper movie", the story of a successful play, a betrayal - an example of this is the Danny's Partners series.
The film alternates between the moods - on one side, the documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic photographs of the events and the way in which the same situations were depicted in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, light-hearted passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there are scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has had a remarkable career reboot.
From a derided actor to a respected director, his acting was no longer the object of ironic commentary.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film not set in the director's hometown of Boston.
His sense of place was one of the characteristics that elevated his earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in the Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the collapse of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotion of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his associates achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (false staff at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told did not actually offer much in the way of cinematic thrills.
He works with the bargain quite successfully, sometimes thinking about reality - everything is not so elegant there (the scene where the impending crisis at Tehran airport turns away the call in America and the chase on the runway seems quite attractive).
But the weakness of the Argo is the distraction that comes from having to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming as Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and are far from the only ones in this film.
Affleck's film is losing its dramatic flair, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciated for its realisation and retro style evoking the thrillers of the '70s.
It's hard to pull.
As a reminder of a still somewhat vivid history and a proof of how exaggerated the notion of an all-powerful and all-knowing secret service is, but it's enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus blowing
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually publishes a survey on the most ridiculous bank charge, has now decided to launch a competition for the "most ridiculous regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"We were led to this by the latest event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities already mentioned is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the rates of premium for men and women.
Until now, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky to the insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of the year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory biofuel mixing, which is harmful to nature, a ban on reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, and a cage-size directive that has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or the exclusion of traditional light bulbs has also faced criticism in the past.
A good banana should be fourteen centimeters long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a particular business or industrial lobby, whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic is now also threatening to veto the demands of its banks).
The lobby also had interests in ensuring that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and not have 'abnormal curvature'.
The European Commission has defended itself by claiming that it is merely harmonising the previously fragmented national standards which have made trade more difficult.
The EU has already relaxed its rules on fruit and vegetables, despite the opposition of some countries, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, which requires inflatable balloons sold to be marked with a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred to US research which found that balloons in toys are the leading cause of death by choking among children.
Similar restrictions now apply to children under 14 blowing in the carpet.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone holding an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the subject to Greece, and must instead refer to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server BankingFunds.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated for the poll, in addition to some of the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that could have been in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the set volumes for e.g. canned mushrooms, for which it faced a heavy fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies on request.
But these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by not having a sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund,' declared then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (Czechoslovakia) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that we had produced a lot of grain and that as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, he had to fill up the warehouses and export them.
For the Czech Republic to have ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic by organising a tender to buy grain from countries without access to the sea.
The grant was offered by the Municipal Ministry for Local Development, headed by Minister Paul Niemiec (US-DEU), to help prepare the application for the grant from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations in the Member States are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to improve the functioning and development of the Union as a whole, are, according to many experts, worthy of recognition.
The more serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects which have no sign of deepening European integration but which have been forced upon them by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The Czech Republic, like other EU countries, is also fighting for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, and it does not always succeed in this struggle.
After six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs were able to defend the name Olomouc, but the rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, was renamed to "Tuzemák" by our producers.
Only products of cane distillate and not of sugar beet may bear the name 'rum'.
The official EU list of registered products already includes the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, and Parma ham, such as Carlsbad sausages, carp and hops from Pohořřníc and Třeboň.
The EU trade mark is also valid for the parrot and the mountain tube.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, what makes a man think he wants to run for president?
I don't care about being a senator or president.
If this country was going smoothly, I wouldn't be running.
But I can't stand to see the last 20 years of the land being stolen, the thieves running around, people getting their taxes and retirement age raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to make a difference, run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but you went straight to the castle.
Doesn't that turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later made it clear that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is a tool to make my vision come true.
That's why I need the most influence and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not just that we as a nation are swearing in pubs and on TV, but that we are trampling on anyone who wants to try to make a difference.
Add to this the media that degrade man and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
It was said that I bribed journalists or that I was an adviser to George Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You've gone into the battle for the Castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the restitution of property over 20 million.
You'll have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that power, and only the Senate as a whole can make laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I lobbied as a citizen to make tourism a free enterprise, it was successful.
The problem is the politicization - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, they deliberately reject it, and that's what's holding the citizens back.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much greater potential to win support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party boxing and dogma I can take what's best for our country from either side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more right-handed or left-handed?
From a Czech perspective, I think people tend to put me on the left.
It doesn't matter to me if it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if you're on the left or the right, I want to connect people.
I will always support any publicly good solution, whether it is proposed by the CCP or the ODS, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're kidding when someone calls you a populist.
But you don't prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to approach.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working around the world, or have been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you'll only have passwords.
And that's not going to work in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material liability?
I don't have any other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push it.
If I were elected president, I would have no problem organizing a live TV broadcast where I would ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate for material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell me why they don't want it.
If there's a strong personality who can name the bad guys, you can push them into the political arena.
Take the direct election of the president, it was the merit of public pressure.
I'm just saying, I'm an amateur, and I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I'm just getting started in politics, and I'm going to try to get a majority for my program.
I'm trying to move things along on my own, and if I don't, I'm gonna quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything in one person, so I've been running around a bunch of people I know, see if they're running for the Senate, too.
I went to Radim Jančura, he refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorenca, who was exposing light oil scams.
I ran with the idea that people are really unhappy, but now I'm in a bind.
Sixty percent of the people didn't vote, and those who did, they mostly voted for establishment leaders.
So we're the only two independents in the Senate.
The people have made it so difficult for the Senate to pass the amendments.
But I'm still going to fight for my vision, like direct election of mayors or mayors.
Are you thinking of starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have the time to check the clean history of every potential party, and I don't have the money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, I only have 20 grand in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
I estimate his personal wealth at about $60 million.
I have a property in Prague for about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of artworks for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skod Superb for a million and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, I got an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream -- I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against evil and filth.
You drive an Aston Martin, you're worth $60 million, and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put much of your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I owe you?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that there's probably not that much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs are basically going to cover what I get for my senatorial salary.
But I couldn't make a living out of it, like I couldn't pay for my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be running for office.
So you're gonna keep doing business to make a living?
Didn't you say you'd suppress these activities?
But it's not about the pay.
As I promised, I've partially suppressed my activities.
For example, my deputy will be the tour operator in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan who would save the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much did you get as an entrepreneur a month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I'll take.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.

MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don't just happen in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built Book Mountain - 2 images
"The building looks cheerful, futuristic, and there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, who walks along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says: "Of course, the house is nice".
But I'm asking, why do we need a library today?
They all have the Internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-fashioned libraries are voluntarily visited anymore, are they?
Spijkenisse, a settlement in the vicinity of Rotterdam with no job opportunities of its own, not even worth visiting, holds a peculiar record.
This municipality, with its 80 000 inhabitants, has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted miniature fictional iron-concrete bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
The success of the educational offensive was not, however, daunting.
And so the city council realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we had to have a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of wildly daring column charts and of making witty, often even cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual calm and appeared at the 2003 competition with five books under his arm and a disgrace on his face.
And while the committee was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the bold Maas poured his gifts on himself by size and ended his activist-motivated speech with the words "Dear Township!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 flats.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town grey, which until now could not offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would expect a dairy, is thus a little richer in contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
It's a long way to the book
First impression: the reader's eldorado under the cheese cap.
Although there is an elevator through the mountain, you will discover the true passion for space and reading only when you walk through the topography.
The glass-covered interior is bright and clear on all sides, and the burnt-out floor and elegant street lamps clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, and a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"Normally, bookshelves are along the facade, and there is a large dark space in the middle, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We've turned the classical spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader space from the inside out.
The interior of the Book Mountain is well-used: offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological centre and a central home appliance centre are located in the centre.
A special delight are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall-coverings, sometimes parapets, and sometimes stair rails.
The look, the texture, the smell, it's all different.
Even the most accomplished architects and civil engineers are turning their heads over unfamiliar building materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here", says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in an interview with the Standard magazine.
So one day, on a farm in Friesland, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product.
For many years, a millimeter-wide synthetic rootstock has been used as a root support in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
Thin fabric can last one or two seasons and then it's ripe for bulk waste.
For the library, the first such quantity of the rune was milled on plates four centimeters thick.
By applying heat and pressure, so-called Landbouwplastic (LBP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, wearable material that smells a little like a new car and a little like athletic shoes.
You take 105 steps to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in flower beds.
They care about the atmosphere, but most importantly, the proper humidity in the literature mountains.
Gifts for a new soul
"You might not believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is an ecological landmark", says Trouborst.
It's heated and cooled by the Earth's heat.
Although the Book Mountain is covered with a glass canopy, the sun shines only briefly inside, even on sunny days.
The wide, glued wooden beams perpendicular to the glazed facade serve as shade and capture much of the sun's rays.
The atmosphere in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will be handled by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the early skeptic in the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even refers to as "the long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from their personal fund.
The first step was to fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully equipped and currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that with our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship to the new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for decoration.
This is what the MVRDV has done in the royal discipline called in the professional jargon of identity formation.
Spijkenisse was writing the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
That's the starting point for identity, after all.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained from voting on the decision to accept Palestine.
According to US-European relations expert Stephen Szabo, this puts Berlin on the edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Why?
Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
It was finally adopted by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that they are changing their foreign policy, from a policy that was, so to speak, led by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and united policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they're just settling into their role, but they're on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy they have in France or Britain.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its own interests.
Did economic interests influence the position on the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
So they have to be careful not to scare the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
That's what matters.
I don't want to give it too much importance, but it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
But it is still a major factor in the German thinking.
Did Germany's abstention from voting on two important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine, harm its relations with the United States?
I think there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the United States for the German position.
So I don't think it was as dramatic a breakthrough as Libya.
I hope Germany will even gain some respect from it.
This signals that it must be regarded as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has been very clear about its veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration has a pretty good understanding of the European position behind it.
But, of course, because of the political situation there, he cannot take this position publicly.
I think the differences of opinion are really not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what's making it difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of the larger picture and they have to push things forward from their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European attitude.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, especially because of its relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans understand that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player, or does it want to take the lead?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
If we look at the European crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, there is an anti-German sentiment.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be acceptable to all the different neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
The US' influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not currently filling that vacuum.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America study together the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a designation which is fully registered in China but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, it shall enjoy protection until the actual trademark proprietors sue.
And even then, it's not clear if they're going to get justice.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specializes in infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters need a few more letters to register their trademarks.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens the event with the records of the Beijing stamp office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand name Zegna DF Puma, a name that is also parasitic on the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It's well known that the Chinese are the world's masters at copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shops selling almost exclusively counterfeit goods.
But Pattloch's case is different, and he is proceeding on the authority of his clients against Chinese firms receiving from the Trademark Office the full and official right to use a mark that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an affiliate brand.
This word is focused on "Bang Dakuan".
That's what they mean by women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's hurting business, we have to fight it", Pattloch urges.
"The badge is diluted, the exclusive status is gone, the damage to the image is enormous".
Financial losses and legal costs for the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the erasure of questionable trade mark records is difficult and expensive.
The trial can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcomes.
Pattloch recounts cases where the court dismissed lawsuits because the name they were suing became "market reality" after a long time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
The known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently taken over the German manufacturer of pumps for the concrete mixture Putzmeister.
Thus, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the star of a Mercedes.
Geely, the company that bought Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW.
Fashion company Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO admits that in 2010 there were shortcomings due to too few staff and too little space.
But last year, it was reported that "the work process has returned from an emergency to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed objection proceedings fell by 22%.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet, 81,500 complaints are still pending before the Office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, more than 1,4 million trade mark applications were received by the CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
That's a record, and it means China is leading the world in new applications for the 10th consecutive year.
This is also true of the total number of trademarks in force - 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
Simply put, each subscription costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times more to start a dispute against it, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
This company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for over seven years.
The Germans did manage to get his illegal production of imitation car parts stopped.
However, the forger has secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand and continues to do so.
We would have forgotten that, because in Germany, surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chief executive of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In two other instances, Freudenberg won the case, but the defendant is still fighting the case.
You must be very careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident the case will end well and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "Government is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves".
The internal costs are incalculable, and they even had to look through the company's archives, a hundred years old, to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the other party a "high six-figure sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
"You can see what this means to us", Wentzler says.
The danger from the Far East threatens to spread to Europe.
And that's in case the impersonators get unprotected tags.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
This business line was abandoned by the group long ago, but it was still able to withdraw the registration.
"You have to be very careful", says Wentzler.
He and Attorney Pattloch are advising German companies to be very careful in their dealings with China.
Rather than relying on international trademark rights, foreigners should "register in China anything that is worth protecting in any way", Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be a lot more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg's company were to give up the brand in the final act of its drama, then it would probably have to pay royalties in its own name on a reciprocal basis, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: singing, helping and giving
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi congregation is testing - and in Swaziland, orphans whose parents died of AIDS are rejoicing.
A story of connection that spans well over 8,733 kilometers.
First there's the stomping: cowboy high heels, basketball shoes, ladies' boots and men's moccasins look for the beat on the floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the singers' voices - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly rise, urging, mummying, and chasing each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it from his textile shoes as he connects the voices with his wildly attractive gestures.
It's Monday night, and the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers came in, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from a researcher in human genetics to a housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, with each chorus having a different lyrics and, moreover, in a very foreign language - Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-Help
The United Nations AIDS Program estimates that some 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans whose parents died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is already HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans whose parents died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found a sponsor in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
70 of them are in secondary school.
You can take over the patronage for 15 or 20 euros a month.
He guarantees the child a school tuition, a school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means "story-teller" or "one who glorifies" in Zulu.
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this room, only sing.
For nearly a decade, he has been rehearsing the choir's songs in this foreign soft language, occasionally bringing them back to where they originated: southern Africa.
The village of Esitjeni, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is 8,733 miles [8,733 km] from Heidelberg, and depends on the German congregation's loud voices.
Forty percent are infected.
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple mud or straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them are orphaned by the HIV virus.
And what you see in Eswatini is a small, but amazing thing in Swaziland: the highest HIV prevalence, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male foreskin circumcision, which has been shown to halve the risk of infection, is not accepted by the general population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus with a weakened immune system, and it is not uncommon for them to die in less than 30 years.
The village was discovered by the congregation during a trip through Africa in the spring of 2005, but the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a complete education, they have no chance in a poor country.
It started as a private initiative of individuals who, for a few dollars a year, could send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, Voices for Africa was founded, and since then it has been caring almost professionally for orphans whose parents have died of AIDS.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The mosquitoes and scabies are parasitic SPIs.
Who are the most affected?
Syphilis and gout are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases include chlamydia, trichomonas, candidiasis (fungus), mumps, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively uncommon among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
And we have a lot of human papillomaviruses in our teenagers.
How's the infection rate?
Not all STDs need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one tenth less than the year before.
What are the warning signs of STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, difficulty in urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer complete protection.
For STDs can be transmitted in part by infection through impurity and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in cases of frequent sexual intercourse.
Early diagnosis can cure most SPIs and prevent later consequences.
Through patronage, charitable donations, and not least the fees the choir earns by singing throughout Germany, some money is raised.
"In total, we have already sent some EUR 200,000 to Estonia", says the association's president, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village itself by Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can make a stand.
She also makes sure that orphaned children find shelter, such as at one of the grandmothers' homes.
Gogo, as the Zulu call old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some have even taken in 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads, and making sure that the children arrive at school on time in uniform every day.
Children who have no one left go to the shelter of Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the union as well as two cooks who cook for over 200 starving children every day.
Voices for Africa also set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and worked with the U.S. Public Health Service Institute to get many people in the village to get tested for HIV.
It's not a matter of course, even though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 Wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Quite odd, in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his unforgiving lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says that although condoms are free on every street corner, "no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse".
To encourage cultural exchange, Imbongi tour southern Africa together every two or three years, singing songs of grief, fighting, hope for the future, and black self-confidence that many in the southern tip of the continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the Negro language - such an award not only brings cheer and joy but has already brought tears to the eyes of many wild border guards.
The road always leads to Esteni, where the singers visit the children they patronize.
Although this village is hard to find on maps, it is well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esteni, there is light", they say.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, which is an airline 8733 kilometers from here, to the singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see that light is also shining here.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, it also contains frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence of an ice sheet in the region of this planet that lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 12 inches [30 cm] long and possibly as strong as 65 feet [20 m].
This water seems to have come from comets or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not link the discovery of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said the lead scientist on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help explain how water and other basic elements of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and tiny robots like the Phoenix, unseen by Earthlings, are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to Earth, a small window into the infinite farthest reaches.
This image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, except for the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 new definition.
This infrared image from the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars, the oldest stars looking like blue dots, the most difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the birth hall of the stars.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This shifting heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The ring is made of material that the star has shed during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
The image of the crib was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades constellation, also called the Seven Sisters, is visible at night with the naked eye.
But the telescope makes the colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may appear to the observer as a red eye in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the Earth's continent earned the nebula the name North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is causing the unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was captured in full glory by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they came to be is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
It's possible that these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope: a spiral galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies are transformed into artworks by their coloration.
This image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (three-part, three-branched), for dark streaks of dust divide the searing heart of this star-forming womb into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonos, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are colliding and must inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
For those who don't like technical acronyms, they may call her the Southern Wind.
This image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cut of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
This nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, which is 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The crib of stars is giving birth to new growths.
Also, these stellar clouds, combined with the Rosetta Nebula, are giving birth to ever-new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was predominantly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it to observe the stars a year before Galileo.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been enlarged - and the views they convey have become ever deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
There's a large binocular telescope in Arizona.
It allows us to peer into the universe through two mirrors, each measuring some 25 feet [8.4 m] in diameter.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma, one of the Canary Islands, is huge, measuring only 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, it is about 35 feet [11 m] in diameter.
Disadvantage of the cheap design: the telescope is secured by a hook at an angle of elevation, thus limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the light flux.
Despite its relatively small diameter, this is equivalent to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists are searching for extraterrestrial signals in space.
This radio telescope is 305 meters in diameter.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner who provides its computing power can help.
A view of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
The Very Large Telescope stands here, and it lives up to its name.
This telescope, with a total of four mirrors, can illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters in length and is to be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But the images can be expected as early as 2018.
The two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the world's largest until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes to look out into space.
A new giant telescope - a 30-meter-diameter mirror - is also to be built on Mauna Kea.
You can see it in the picture.
But the most important images of the universe are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
He's been providing us with images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for exoplanets - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission began.
This image documents the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space first in 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are assuming that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
There is no reliable data for this, however, because Messenger orbits this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar readings have indicated that Mercury is ice for decades.
The Messenger probe, launched in 2004 and the first to orbit Mercury, has given scientists a sense of certainty.
Drink butter every day and you'll live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to see the biblical age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97 year olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to see the biblical age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97 year olds are still relatively young.
The ride up the Talysh mountains is what you might call wildly romantic.
The microbes roar along the many turns along the heavily wooded hills, the ravenous rivers, and the simple country houses.
Everything is green and juicy, almost like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the far south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here live the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, about whom little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani fluently and live to a very advanced age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental Soviet-era architecture that somehow doesn't fit in with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists don't come here, and it's too difficult to get from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
The 200 miles (323 km) are eight hours because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to the oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
But Pilata Fatulaeva, 48, believes Lerik is destined to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world next year", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the lives of nearly eight dozen Talish people from the area, who are over a hundred years old, are documented.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had a child.
The controversial star of the museum, however, is sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And since the oldest person with ID was 122 years old, Mussulmov's age seems highly questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
This man was said to have been married three times and to have had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was said to have fathered a daughter.
So, did Şirali Müslümov's age not be a few decades off?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also a significant number of elderly people in some areas of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and an extremely large number of very old men in Sardinia".
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially when the matrices are missing.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
But the fact is, people in the area around Lerik are experiencing the Biblical age remarkably often.
There are currently 20 individuals who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
Farid Mugimzadeh, an Azerbaijani guide, explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the museum, Fatulyeva, believes it's in the food.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, does not seem plausible from a bromatological point of view.
In Cengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzaeva.
At 97, she's still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the floor with a butterfly, which he tirelessly rocks.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around.
The kitchen prepares tea for guests, which is served in typical armado belly glasses.
Mirzaeva's white teeth form a perfect line, and under the scarf she hides a long dark blond scarf, which her son proudly unveils to us.
I always washed my hair with milk so it didn't look bad and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either", says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate what came from her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peaches.
I've never bought groceries in a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But things got better when the paddle was taken over by "beloved father" Geydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds weird coming from an old woman.
However, the cult that is built around the figure of the father of nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzaev receives a monthly pension of 230 manat (about the same amount in euros), which is a good amount for a living in the country.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-haired son is right: "The elderly are held in high esteem in our culture".
They live in the midst of a large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The unbridled demonstrations in Cairo have revealed the deep division of the country.
There is a heated debate about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president has been a pain in the ass.
We need to create a passage.
"And for us to succeed, I am responsible, before the people and before God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the nation as a whole, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secularists.
All those who, so far, have been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a "God state" on the Nile, at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said almost apologetically that he had temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, in the United States, really wants to save, is not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Is the judiciary to be stripped of its power?
The 234 paragraphs that the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly of 100 voted for in a hasty 15-hour night marathon are partly cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the proposal states that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use this vague formulation and the legal space associated with it to interpret the Sharia more strictly.
At least this is clarified by the newly added paragraph: In all matters related to Sharia, one should consult with al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on all Sunni Islam.
This may not be the case, but it may mean that the clergy will exercise oversight over the legislature, which would effectively deprive the judiciary of its authority.
There are many things to interpret in the draft Constitution.
The problem is also that the civilian jurisdiction of the military courts is to be maintained.
These courts were used under Mubarak to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values", the proposal says.
This is so legally vague that by this paragraph the state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain language, it means nothing more than censorship.
Moreover, no paragraph explicitly defines equality between men and women in writing.
Another paragraph forbids defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his emissaries.
But it remains unclear what the defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
The wording that "insulting people" is forbidden is also questionable.
Is it enough to make a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of the legal experts?
The issue of interpretation, like many others in this bill, which Morsi will submit for signature and, in his words, will present "very soon" to Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks now, opposition has been forming against the Islamist advance.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unison in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night, vowing to destroy the constitutional charter before it could take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbah, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, has declared the draft constitution to be "the garbage dump of history".
Through the short-message service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition member Yasir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is still not punished", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced they will not oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood has declared a protest, but not in Tahrir Square, as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many women with veils and Salafist supporters attended, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They called on Morsi to "cleanse the land!" and assured him, "The Koran is our constitution".
The battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like situation.
Morsi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution have spoken loudly and clearly.
Now it's time to let the people at the polls decide which way the country is headed.
The majority is seen as certain in favour of the Islamists' proposal.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is being handled by Hafiz Abu Sa'd.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because he believes human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And the new constitution now does not contain the word 'human rights' even once", he complained in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three branches of government forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous violation of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president has effectively abolished it", complains Sa'da.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which has been watching the ideological factions' struggle on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
That could get him back.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control".
Norway lobster: The most stinking fish in the world?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country's success be linked to the local appetite for exceptionally smelly fish?
Have some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet football gear.
Leave it on for a week.
You get a paralyzing smell of raffinade, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, a beautiful view - and there's a pervasive smell in the air.
Raffles are salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - depending on how much you want the fish to smell.
As night falls and it gets colder, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, if you like, most seductive food.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also known as the "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival's running.
All around us, people eat little fish cubes and drink them with large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to codfish", says Harvard.
The drink can be overpowering.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's like a piece of sushi that's been on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time when Norway was poor, and because there were no refrigerators, fish were soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they were taken out and eaten - no doubt numbed by the alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their homeland in search of work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
The population is currently growing rapidly - over 13% are immigrants attracted by the large amount of work, high wages and extensive care systems.
The people of Sweden, an old rival that was far richer than Norway until recently, are flocking to the country for work.
The rackfish is seen as an important, indispensable, if rather smelly, part of Norway's past.
It's one of the more expensive foods on the market.
Although expensive, a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) each.
Norway often does not make the world's news - and most people seem to be happy about it.
The name Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22 incident".
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Norway's current wealth is the result of the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says our waitress Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes is a prototype of Nordic prosperity, as she serves plates of dried codfish.
We are, as you say, considerate people.
Her English, like most people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't show off, we don't like to show off.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - except for a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial collapse was throwing away money they didn't have, the Norwegians had their pockets tightly tied.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And eat the raffin", he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I'm sick of the rack.
A moose burger like that is definitely something else, and it's super juicy.
But the fish stink is back tonight.
The hotel where I live is one of many places where raffinade is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most challenging, fish to taste.
They're connected to a live TV broadcast where the host is with a butterfly surrounded by a plate of codfish.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Harvard. " This is our score.
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, possibly battered by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a tough start
As Mexico's incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad these days.
In a city that is crowded even in its best days, steel barriers have been erected to close several key routes to the capital and cause chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been doing well economically under the outgoing Felipe Calderón, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already cost an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people in reducing violence", President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the president of the United States, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views of the new leader are mixed even in his old homeland, a populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered in a good way.
The citizens credit him with the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now get to the city by one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built, a huge improvement over the bumpy, bumpy roads that were there before.
His name is also displayed on the walls of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change", says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state deputy for President Pena Nieto's party, the Institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).
We especially hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economic spheres that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vincent Fox.
Member Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the presidential palace Los Pinos, much is expected from Enrique Pena Nieto inside the party.
And he rejects the opposition's statement that the new president is a man of no substance.
He's a very straightforward man, very concerned with the excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo is not more pronounced.
Stuck under the highway overpasses, it is in many ways like the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to help control drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly aggravated by violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in the desert next to a huge dumpster.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico during the governorship of Pena Nieto, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, Pena Nieto's critics say that during his time in office, he failed to adequately address the issue of women's murder.
And at worst, they accuse his leadership of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me a photo of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna, and suppresses her tears.
The official version is that Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if someone had washed her body", recalls Mrs. Buendia.
He had bruises and postmortem stiffness.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, which has the only word on it: "Justice".
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, trouble-maker, and whiner.
They want you to just take what they say and keep quiet.
"But it can't be right when there's been so much mistakes and oversights", he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday comes with a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new president has promised that they will be his priority while he is in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor", says PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what the victims' families in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the mistreatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to disprove Bradley Manning's allegations of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds of Manning's abusive treatment in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the harsh treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein, in cross-examining Private Manning at a preliminary hearing at Fort Maede, Maryland, argued that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during a hearing held on the motion by the defense to dismiss the case against Manning on grounds of the harsh treatment he received while in custody, which in itself is a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, Military Prosecutor Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico Correctional Facility, where he was held under increased security from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers were asking Manning questions and recording his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, although Manning's officers directly questioned how he was being treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various problems orally and that the officers who visited him had talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they would address them, but had not noted these problems.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them", Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment of his person in January 2011 at a meeting of the committee examining suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed in a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The military stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one level below the suicide watch regime) for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to end this injury prevention regime... so I could enjoy the increased quality of life that I saw", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday that he was arrested in Iraq and transported to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention facility at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he'd considered suicide in Kuwait and one day he fainted from the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the world around him was very depressing.
"My world has shrunk to just the Arifjan base, to that cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, sweaters, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned the allegation made in Thursday's testimony that after being forced to sleep one night in his Quantico cell naked, he was also forced to stand naked before guards and other inmates at the morning countdown.
Manning testified that he wasn't allowed to cover himself with his blanket during the count.
In Friday's hearing, Judge Manning said that he had been told by his guards to put down a blanket to cover himself, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to put it down.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his call signs to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his calluses and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that his sentence will be significantly reduced if he is convicted by a military court, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense has said it plans for Manning to plead guilty to lesser felonies and will fight the other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the terms of his detention as legitimate.
The Pentagon issued a statement saying Manning was being held in accordance with regulations governing all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, unlawfully causing the disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmitting information related to national security, and theft of public property or records.
If he's charged with all the charges, he could get a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of the hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On my last trip to Mexico City, I barely made it through the crowd and I arrived at the immigration agenda room, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in central California and I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's an ethnic acronym, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
So I ended up with the term "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of a conversation in that language.
But I don't have a native speaker's vocabulary, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in line for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment this week when the newly elected Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
They had the usual issues on the agenda when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
And Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has vowed to continue Mexico's war on the drug cartels, though he has not provided any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of arms to sign over half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, reminiscences are omnipresent.
So the minute after a U.S. representative says something even slightly critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and among the elite complaints about how the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma will take the war path.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who have the country's options, and others who don't.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or a grandparent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than not, this person matched the profile -- dark skin, poor education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And while we're living the American dream now, going to good schools, and having good jobs, we can never forget the fact that we're living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may be unclear at times, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we know that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a humiliating reminder of defeat and they see us as an inferior race that's not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is nothing but failure to them.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't be trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans are reluctant to take it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, a lot of Mexican Americans I know don't feel like they're part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, they look at us like we're Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to complicate matters further, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligence, as I learned during my trip, are trying to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "temporary ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country, and press political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
I'm not sure.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure this is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair. I know.
If at least some Mexicans are not willing to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel a grudge for the way their family members were treated in the relatively recent past.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be a precarious basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such mischief is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets were fired from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught in the continuing chaos in the region.
It may make their fight bloodier than ever before.
However, there is reason to believe that this may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at the present time.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds, the fighting this week has strengthened the hawkishness on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim that they forced the Israelis to retreat even though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite killing several Hamas leaders and locking up 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most deplorable and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well judge that time is on their side.
The Islamists gained more influence throughout the Arab world, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy allies.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering Hamas people say the Islamic crescent is circling around Israel, from northern Lebanon, where the Hezbollah party/military is ruling, through Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly leaning towards Islamism, can topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
And most importantly, in the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pillar of the Arab world, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that neither Israel nor America can rule out.
On the other hand, the hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas has been put back in the box.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile defense system has proved its worth and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as unwavering as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for the latest round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, in part because of the wall that encroaches on the West Bank, the main part of what may one day become a Palestinian state, and protects the growing Jewish settlements despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party allied itself with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the campaign for the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets like their compatriots in Gaza?
We'd better keep them behind the wall and beat them when their heads pop out.
The hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring may change their minds.
While the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel much, their top priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with a local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economies.
President Morsi's collaboration with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and may be the beginning of something new.
The Israelites should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
As the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, the denial of Palestinian self-determination creates a powder keg that must one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are making the situation worse as the Arab population grows.
The bloody uprisings against Gaza every few years to suppress Hamas will increasingly take the diplomatic toll.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides are reporting, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states, where Israel cedes territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that the ceasefire will give outside pressure at least a little more leverage to push this cause forward.
Egypt, which must work with Turkey and Qatar to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the land and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs on the outside must also push for a compromise between Hamas and Fatah.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has a role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's pathetically shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
It means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia , ugly cigarette packaging laws have been passed .
The invisible green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, display warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
The first of its kind in the world, Australia's ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws were enacted, and the logo and colours of the labels were replaced by generic olive-green boxes with hideous images of diseased body parts and images of children and newborns sick from their parents' smoking.
As of Saturday, the only difference between the boxes, apart from various health warnings and images, are the brand names, which are printed in the same lower case.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regulation in the world.
The Australian federal government claims that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by making the habit unattractive.
It relies on studies showing that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never start.
"Even very young children can be seen to understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them with their products", says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that the law would increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will have serious unintended consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in many more of these products to be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that the demand for silicone cigarette packs used to cover nasty boxes rose from near-zero sales two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals of the laws to the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha stated that Zico has sold almost 6 000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible landmark, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from the eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned internet advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a marketer in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, then the online space is the place you want to be", says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and got the job and made this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to deal with the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new regulations - countries that the World Trade Organization claims trade is unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries doing significant business with Australia.
The decision of the SOE is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has been in talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are being considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa, and India.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take out a cigarette and you put the box back in", says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that the single boxes make it harder for him to balance them on the shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours", Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, and then we'd say, 'OK, that's it, we're closing the store,'" he said, and he decided with his hands.
In a world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored.
On the last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite being distracted by books, magazines and the iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in child development are increasingly coming up with the praise of boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And since most of us are connected to a screen all the time these days, we don't get a chance to enjoy boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
- I know.
No, you didn't.
But I'll get back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon, which came with the advent of more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History, says (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history", he said.
In Pompeii, a Latin inscription on the walls of the first century C.E. was found that referred to boredom.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I couldn't".
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says that apathy doesn't make you want to do anything.
At its core, he says, boredom is "a disturbance of the attention process associated with a bad mood and a feeling of time passing slowly".
Boredom can be very like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, whereas people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape recording of a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group did not hear it at all.
Those who listened to the program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they weren't sure why, and they attributed the problems to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or challenging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, "such as looking for faulty parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you to keep your mind off the work".
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and blinking, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people more physically alert.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to roll learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", said Professor Fenske.
We've all had a dull moment - my flight delayed, the speaker buzzing, a particularly long movie.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists developed the "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions like, "A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all".
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to be more bored than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimulation.
However, teenagers are generally uneducated.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of the teenagers said they were bored at school and doing their homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "puberty is the peak of boredom", largely because children and youths are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boredom good for you?"
Research shows that sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble, or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cook, you'll enjoy it.
However, watching television will give you pleasure only for a short time, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to entertain himself or drive by himself, Professor Fenske said.
And "this self-management is transferred from one situation to another", said the professor.
Your child will not only learn to entertain himself but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Our goal should be to feel comfortable when we're out of reach of the constant grind of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed to it.
"We blame it on the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected to something meaningful", he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly re-stimulated", he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain ourselves when the noise is off".
There's no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a high school student and football player from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for what will soon be legal statewide - possession of several grams of marijuana and the pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he was driving with some friends in Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug-using equipment - misdemeanors punishable by a $100 fine each - and was given a trial date.
"They treated us like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks since the Colorado vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends more on the location than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession violations have already been dismissed here and in Washington State, which has passed similar measures.
The police department has stopped charging adults 21 and older for possession of small amounts, which will be legally allowed after the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts in Colorado have said they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still charge people with possession.
Meanwhile, several cities from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their communities.
"This thing is moving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even the regulators in Washington state are getting their heads chopped off.
And they're looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licensing for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can follow", he said.
Washington's law, I-502, takes effect on December 6th, which also leaves a one-year gap during which the state's licensing system will not yet exist, but legal possession will.
And there are some intricate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this time, such as how to balance the state's directive on "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition on the sale of cannabis within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or child care centers.
"Nowhere will it be harder to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute small-scale marijuana possession offenses against every citizen over the age of 21 and that police would stop charging people with these crimes "with immediate effect".
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is taking a tougher line.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many are facing additional charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred", Mr Buck said in a statement.
The response was complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer charging adults with possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supports this decision, but he also decided not to dismiss all the ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the mixed reactions across the state to this big state green experiment revealed a deep divide among local officials.
For district attorneys, it's a "cultural barrier", said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal", he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as if they were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are well on their way to becoming national test cases for drug legalization.
The defense and state agencies are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to declare the sale and cultivation of marijuana a federal crime.
The marijuana legalization advocates are hoping the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana dealers and patients who use it that have attracted attention, the federal government has mostly kept medical marijuana businesses in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to bust through doors to intercept a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana businesses authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal action.
Even before Election Day, some local governments have approved moratoriums on any new marijuana businesses, although it will be another year or so before any businesses can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the western part of the state proposed a six-month ban, and it's likely to go into effect next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we license someone and then we have a big federal issue", said Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a Conservative".
It is not just today's university students who are challenged for their beliefs.
I don't remember ever not dreaming of studying at Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother attended what I thought was the world's greatest seat of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium of the twelve motivating pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And meanwhile, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of entering Worcester College, where I was going to study history, I packed my bags and got into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I gave up because I objected to making love to students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson bluntly stated that I left because I was forced to drink from broken cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment, it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You might ask why I'm bringing it up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students, right from the center, are suffering from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same rights protections as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior College Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks, and made to feel unwelcome".
They are asking for a position on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, a student political drama that portrayed conservatives as freaks and neo-Nazis.
The program featured alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say that they are treated as "sacrificial lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence is growing on the university campuses.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us".
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant", while 19-year-old OUCA president-elect Stephanie Cherill says there has been a deterioration in the JCR's approach to right-of-centre people.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion as well as to the well-being of the members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was in a one-member minority.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse the honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would tremble with fear.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students are meeting with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of the diaper that was to come.
I found that not only do professors tacitly approve of the pimping of conservative students, but they are willing to participate.
The timber-lined auditoriums were filled with the politics of mining strikes, privatization and the government's resistance to apartheid sanctions in South Africa.
My first lecture was about translating an 18th-century French text into English, and I wasn't prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I was getting pretty rough.
Professor Pitt, the little man with the face of pie dough, was very gallant.
"Do the Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
I was in tears.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social matters", Professor Pitt concluded.
I went back to my room, devastated.
I was sitting alone at dinner at school when I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder.
He was a sophomore named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the Conservative first-timers pretend to be Labour.
Later, at the local tavern, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted on disagreeing with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick has proven unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who went to Eton, ironically, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are infected.
The other students took notes with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love?" one asked.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt like the homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the '60s.
Could I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I change to Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me had been a purge of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based in my faculty.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He was barely there.
He hated the place for its petty and petty nature and for its inclination to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I started driving from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his time at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreams.
Even my Communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes were blurred.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience worsened.
My friend, also a Conservative, succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, during class, when another history professor declared in all seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was blushing with shame, I admitted that my "parents brainwashed" me and called them "old fools".
The relief was short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was my father.
He wrote two columns a week for Murdoch's paper at the time.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
After they left, I packed my bags and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a grumpy weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and toxicity in an educational institution.
Even more tragic, it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Conservative prime ministers, but which still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and free thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentin Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Design", which presents more than 130 high-end fashion models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but which could not have been written without his esteemed clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is filled with private correspondence and photographs signed by the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Princess Maria-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exposes these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from Voghera in northern Italy to the international idol of "Bohemian creams".
There's nothing wrong with liking royalty.
"At least they don't drop a cigarette into a great carpet, as some wonderful pop-music celebrities do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we lived in the Alps together and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests with grace and elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad", explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he's a star".
Valeria Mazz is playing Valentino.
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentinian model Valeria Mazz.
"It has been many years since we had a dinner with him after a show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were 20 of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decorations, the food, the music, everything was reflected and he could feel his spirit.
It made everyone invited feel important and loved", recalls the top model who began working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", he concludes.
A parade of nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of true love.
He loves people with good education and better degrees and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been converted into a distinctive 70 metre long passage offering role-playing: the visitor turns into a model and walks through the passage to observe the "custom" of dreams worn by Valentine's masterpieces such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Night", or the wool and fur coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
The models in the audience include Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that first Valentine's Day is like first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, a gilet jacket and a jacket from the 1971-72 autumn-winter collection.
It was a gift he made me", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity and his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors she uses, they brighten up a lot and give the face a "spark".
The proportions are perfect".
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she dressed for Valentine's Day for the first time.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
She finally made it to the late '90s.
"My first dress from Valentine's Day was for a celebration at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a skirt with a ring, a lace-up waistline and a top without sleeves.
It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax with fashion, his passion is timeless", explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's formal dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that they have inside".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her wedding to Paul the Greek in 1995.
The ivory-colored silk dress, with twelve different types of cut, and a four-and-a-half-meter [4.5 m] length of pullover, took four months of work and 25 "beads" (as the designer of his sewing machine calls it) to make.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the foremost authority on the specialized press, these dresses represent a landmark of late 20th-century high fashion, "the return of high-society clientele".
Valentino, dazzled by the elitist "savoir-être" over the years, is now the best example of it.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded with the Order of the Legion of Honour accumulates as much honour as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I was always attracted by his refinement, calmness, refinement and perfection", admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
He was flawless, time left no trace on him".
When the princess says so...
The hardest craft in the world: sulfur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, the volcanoes in Indonesia risk their lives and health to carry 70 pounds [70 kg] of sulfur down steep rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are people who literally work in hell.
That is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern island of Java in Indonesia.
That's why he has to work his way to the bottom of the crater every day, where sulfur gases escape from the Earth's interior and become solid when exposed to the air.
After cutting large blocks of sulfur, weighing up to 70 pounds [70 kg], he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along rough stone trails.
It is only a quarter mile [250 m] to the summit of the 2,386-meter-high volcano, but it takes over 40 minutes for the exhausted climbers to climb at a tortoise's pace, keeping their balance and carefully considering their steps so as not to slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners at Kawah Iwan make five cents for every pound of sulfur they mine
When they are up, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like they're monkeys in a circus, and they tirelessly carry heavy baskets to a weight that the mining company has placed slightly lower, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining at the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since the mineral has a place in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilograms [70 lb], we earn about 46,000 rupees [$2,500] for each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes three hours and at the end of it he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (US$11.50) a day.
Although this may seem a negligible amount for such inhuman efforts, it is three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wages of miners here are very high, for example, the coffee picking costs 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the fortnightly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)", explains a porter who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as compelling as sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and eyes irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years old, Anto risks his life three times a day in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though he has a special mask and glasses to protect his face.
He's got asthma, he's got shortness of breath, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that are leaking out of the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French", promises more than solid English.
This charming and intelligent young man, who could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, is destined to become a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden shack with other porters and gets up at two o'clock every morning because the sulfur keeps boiling at night and her characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the darkness, the pharaoh lighted Anto into the crater and illuminated his way with a small lantern, which he had attached to his helmet and bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers carry a basket of sulfur from the crater floor on their shoulders
Although the company has high revenues, it has not mechanised the extraction of sulphur for cost savings, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they don't even get a share of the 30,000 rupees ($2.5) photo surcharge, which, along with the 15,000 rupees ($1.2) ticket, is collected by the park rangers from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for livestock, not people", argues Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavy-duty porter who has been working in Kawah for only three decades since leaving school.
She can lift up to 300 pounds [110 kg], and she assures us that she will keep working "as long as she can", because she needs money to educate her three sons, ages 18 to 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here, because volcano was my whole life
Although the sulfur burns their throats and itch their eyes when the wind turns unexpectedly and catches the miners in the thick vapours coming out of the volcano, the miners are so adamant that none of them complain of serious illness... but this is evident from their frequent breathing difficulties, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only carry 50 kilograms at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which is then transported by three trucks down a steep path through the cluster to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
The oldest of his five sons, he is 30 years old, and he also earns his living by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the enduring misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts endures from generation to generation - crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are blaming not having children on careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot, let's do our civic duty and breed a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a mint candy ad, but nevertheless - or perhaps that's why - a video went viral on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
These are the words of a rap that uses local "put the bucket in the oven" innuendo to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that made the video, hopes that this ad will bring attention to the problem in a humorous way.
Douglas Hamilton, the agency's artistic director, says he wanted to use the influence of music to get people to do "their civic duty".
"It's purely an Internet thing, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing our population, so we felt that was a topic we had to touch on.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like promoting pheromone perfumes or throwing a meet-and-greet.
Many of these ideas could be creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like compose rap, to solve this problem".
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative government and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in terms of population, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Office, says that this is for "better education" and "broader career opportunities".
"People have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, not just marriage and family", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to postponing marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decline in Singapore's birth rate.
While there have been efforts within immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has caused dislike among local residents.
Some Singaporean websites show open xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little effort to integrate.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party last year recorded its worst election result since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem by quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying to keep the housing stock down.
For example, it began to affect the real estate business.
The Urban Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments are 46 square meters and have been a great success in sales.
However, there are concerns that these apartments may encourage a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, claims that their "shoe boxes" sell far faster than larger homes.
"They are more popular, selling days to weeks faster than larger homes.
That's why they're so much better for our cash flow".
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited to offering too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules could lead to an increase in the nation's birth rate, interviews with Singaporeans working in the city's financial district suggest they won't have much of an effect.
"People are always stressed, housing is expensive, and education is expensive, so many people put it off", says a young official.
"Let the rest have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time", says another young man in his early 20's.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons for not having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is the Singaporeans who ultimately have the final say on family formation.
What's private offline is private online.
It's private.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or "a sphere of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any intrusion".
What is privacy for a person under 16?
How does he apply this definition to his daily life and to social media?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to by posting things on the Internet that he would not tell anyone in normal communication?
ElPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be 'something entirely personal' at the personal level and 'username and password' when it was a social network.
"I wouldn't share my biggest secret", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world", he says.
"I post nice pictures on Facebook or pictures of us playing.
I also talk to people I know.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that made someone laugh", he says.
This boy knows it's wrong to post obscene photos, nude photos or crime photos, or write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 of his Facebook friends and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Including a mother who has the name and password to one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account to share my views and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just put them in", he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or communicate quickly with friends", she says.
He says without hesitation that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended him to someone he didn't know.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and at the latter, he admits that he does not know 20 people on his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music", he says.
According to this boy, none of them ever asked him for anything, nor did they ask for his address or phone number.
"If they insist or demand it, I simply remove them from my account", he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading the Twitter recommendations.
These boys are no strangers to what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was", he confirms.
According to Jose, the victim didn't log off the account.
"She just activated the private mode".
Then he explains a series of steps to set up an account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would if I was bothered or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate student in Education, believes that for children and adolescents to navigate social networks properly, they need to understand that the main purpose of social networks is to inform them.
He states: "The Internet began as a means of finding information, but with the advent of social networks, the rules of the game have changed".
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these terms to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people born in this age of technology.
We are digital immigrants, we have to teach them, and we are learning ourselves", she says.
He explains that this is a difficult subject "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet mature enough to do so".
Also, they should be prudent about their surroundings at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, and not to think about the consequences", he adds.
According to this expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents about privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work", he adds.
Marrielos Porras goes on to list some possibilities: If there are things you would not tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, "Would you like someone to post your picture the way you posted your friend's?"
You know what other people are saying about you?
When you tag people in photos of parties, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more thing: do they need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the online environment as well as the offline one.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, people are guided by respect, morality, and other principles, and the same should be true on social media", he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher, and educational consultant, explains that it is essential for parents to read the rules of social networking carefully.
"If they understand every little trick, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences of opening an online account.
For example, about age or what is allowed to be shared or published", he says.
Guardia believes it's crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "don't talk to strangers".
The South American Summit is over and the Lima Declaration has not been released.
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the issuance of the Lima Declaration, which was ratified and supposedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the President's Office, who initially stipulated that the document would be published after the summit, said that it would be published later on the website of the Peruvian government.
They further stated that the content was released by Peruvian President Ollanta Humal in several short press statements.
The press was restricted throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential meeting was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message "confidential meeting, no sound transmission".
The small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokesmen of some governments present at the talks, but not by the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the meeting was a list of the presidents participating, which provoked the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent out an email to the media with a "concluding statement" from the summit, but it is only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, despite the press's fervent demands.
The official ASPA website states that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities tried to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The Summit concluded with, inter alia, a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the defence of both sides on Monday to hear the dispute initiated by Lima against Santiago.
"We will investigate and implement a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing today in this international court", President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts", added Piñera, greeting President Humal with a handshake on the flags of both countries.
The two presidents' confirmation that they would submit to the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, expressing its submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the decision to be completely wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the Presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was instructed to open the morning speeches and conclude the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The President read the final document, informing that 16 agreements had been signed and 31 projects planned between South American countries, with an investment of 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended".
He informed that actions are being supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America and to joint and effective action against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not be victorious in nature, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport connectivity in different parts of South America, especially rural and border areas . . . so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties", the Peruvian president said in a speech read out loud.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and its transboundary axis from the coast to Brazil, and two others concern better connectivity with Ecuador, but did not elaborate.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return her to the Union of South American Nations", from which she is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is united and has good neighborly relations.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice ruling on the maritime border dispute being contested by Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)", Santos said.
"We will discuss all solutions, none are excluded, not even a treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country", he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and precise way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieta.
The EU Ministers of Defence met at the Summit to approve provisionally the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
The members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from Europe about integration
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case indeed, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told state TV Perú that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one nation".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which is supported by the member countries of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country, which already exists between the members of the Andean Community, must be achieved, but there are still backward areas that want to return us to the past", he pointed out.
The Ecuadorian president expressed, among other things, his agreement to the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and that those who signed the San José Pact on Human Rights be taken into account.
"Those in charge never commit to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision, because it did not betray his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time, "there was reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing trial".
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for asking him to be interrogated on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation itself allows for the interrogation to be carried out by videoconference call, which could be carried out from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a minor lung problem, but nothing serious", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition are in danger of deteriorating because he is confined to a small space with no possibility of movement in the fresh air.
This would affect everyone's health", he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that talks had been held with London to resolve the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
"We don't negotiate human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there were constant conversations.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of trials in various European bodies", he said.
He said that "if Britain issues a pass tomorrow, it's all over".
And if Sweden can interview Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as is easily possible under the law there and as has been done in other cases, tomorrow this problem will be put to an end".
Correa used the situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, explaining that he does not tolerate "sub-average, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, the mean and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail", he said.
In this regard, he expressed his happiness that neither such journalists, "nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador", and announced that if re-elected, "he will continue to change in the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto expressed by Paraguay on membership in the Unasur union at least until its next elections, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état wrapped in legality" because in fact "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also said that he considered it "completely appropriate" that his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundary between the two countries now, in the wake of the International Court of Justice ruling in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is not being accepted at this time.
"This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be considered in a broad sense, so that they can be overcome and there is a way forward".
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile, which is being heard by the same court, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international jurisdiction if both countries commit to accept a judgment, however harsh".
Regarding the possibility of running in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term in office, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has stated that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
"I have never been interested in power, but such injustices as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so we must accept this responsibility", he said.
"If I win, it would be my last term as president, and then I would retire from politics.
If we lose, I'm going to do the same thing.
I've made my decision", he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says that President Chávez has gone for scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a recurrence in the president's health", he explained.
The Ecuadorian head of state attended the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) today, which concluded with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like being struck by lightning", he recalls, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "slightly soften", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to inform about it, with such dedication that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the longest-serving patients in the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since he was 22, which was unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there was much doubt, few treatment options, and greater stigma.
At that time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because of the cut".
At the time, AIDS was a death sentence.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and live fully.
However, many people who do not know they have the disease only come to the hospital when the virus has destroyed their body and weakened their immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years after the world's first AIDS outbreak, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great achievement that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara, confirming this information in a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
Infectious disease and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the survival and longevity of a person depends on the degree of immune system damage in the patients diagnosed with the disease, with those who do not use drugs faring better: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed with HIV at age 25 can, according to this finding, "live without problems up to age 75, with treatment", the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth noting that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, and the number of AIDS deaths in Mexico has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the UNAIDS yearbook), it is also true that according to national statistics, 60 percent of AIDS patients have died since the discovery of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 as of May of this year.
Why do people keep dying from disease?
"I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it's done at my hospital.
We haven't used up our medicines for at least the last 12 years, and the problem is that patients come in at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, or the late stage of the disease".
He adds: "Nine out of ten patients come in with an associated infection, and the only thing we can do to make a bigger difference in overall mortality is to diagnose the disease early, so we need to offer screening tests on a large scale to all who ask".
His proposal is in line with the experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco, and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to a private laboratory for tests only because a friend did, and despite his young age, he already had an outbreak of AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather crap three times a week", they say, but that's not my case.
I've been eating healthy, exercising, taking medication".
To this day, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I do a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I take care of myself and the other person responsibly", says Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share his experience with the MILENIO JALISCO newspaper, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today, on World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they're at risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, that's better. And if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like everyone else if they're responsible".
This message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a huge gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who investigates HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task, "the condom distribution has really increased, we used to get one or two, now we get packs and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who don't have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question, full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers, and health care workers, which teens want to avoid, says the reporter.
He proposed changing this inefficient distribution, that the condoms should not be just behind the counter, but that the 100 should be in the dispensers in public toilets, in places where young people often go.
"This is not a promotion of promiscuity.
It's not even about "paying for beer and a motel", as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to condom distribution in his district.
It is best to make condoms available to those who already have sex", he noted.
Key figures in the state of Jalisco
13 435 cases have been reported (12 158 cases of AIDS and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This makes Mexico the fourth country in newly diagnosed AIDS cases and the 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people may be living with HIV, with four to five people for every recorded case who are unaware of the disease.
The judgment upheld by the United States Court of Appeal, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt imposed by the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfavourable precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the corporate restructuring procedures permitted by Mexican law do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars despite international agreements.
The approval of a ruling issued on June 15th of last year by Judge Harlin Hall in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms practically defenseless against the possibility of confiscation of their assets across the river el Bravo.
Nevertheless, the ruling opens the door for a major Mexican glass manufacturer to appeal to the United States Supreme Court against three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge in this case maintains that creditors are to follow United States bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit says that the main procedure provides for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would indicate a lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of multinational enterprises.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, which designates the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without a vote by the branches from the internal structure of the company, when the debts of the parent company Vitro vis-à-vis the branches are recognised, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not be reached.
However, this option is allowed by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose domestic debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Moreover, it is true that even after the votes of the branches had been counted, the creditors - who had brought a case against Vitro in the United States, i.e. the 'soup' funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not have reached a majority.
They'd get about 45 percent to 37 in the vote.
The Court of Appeal disregards that fact.
In the alternative, the Court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the background of the severe economic crisis that hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm of González Sady will appeal the re-evaluation directly to the Court of Appeal, so that the re-evaluation takes place in full attendance, that is, with the participation of five judges, since originally only three voted.
If he fails here, he will seek re-examination of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Court's failure to refer to the document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae service, which details Vitro's proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act, and which points out that the company has taken the liberty of agreeing to agreements signed by both countries to confront the Act with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act, is significant in the present case.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e. the rules designed for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
A collision on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
The overall assessment
For months, a criminal complaint by the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner of Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent dealings, had been lying on the table without being noticed, and according to the pilots' union, the vessels had already leaked.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing them of obstruction of justice.
According to the Commission, the Authority systematically refused to report to the Prosecutor General's Office the transaction carried out by this entrepreneur, in which he withdrew 198 million pesos from the IXE bank from the F/589 trust fund on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
The funds were most likely directed towards the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcarraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Siege of Dragon Mart
A group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens gathered at the Universidad de Caribe campus over the weekend to approve the formation of an association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge commercial and distribution center with products from the "land of the big wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has already managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partly devastate the protected areas and which is the source of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA affair
The request of the Senate, which the government ignored and which requested an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), has become obsolete.
As is known, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out considering it a threat to free expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term ones, Homex developers are putting 500 million pesos of investment certificates on the market.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer interest payments every 28 days.
Competitive is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet has created an association with the trade name Competival, which will target the software services market in Central and South America.
The investment in the business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
World champion basketball player Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved with the sport for over 60 years, traveling the world with it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke in 2008 confined him to a wheelchair, Reyes had been passionate about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, a player in the National Basketball League (BSN), the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I have been in many roles in my life in basketball, including several at the same time, such as being president of the BSN National League, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s", Reyes recalled during a visit to reporters from Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia from his long career, bear this out.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest of all movements, the guards are those who recall his time at Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to compete with the team los Vaqueros since 1967, eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship -- 1981 when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
"The team then took over from 'Cuco' Ortiz, who was an excellent leader", Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was the former coach here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and he said, 'I've got a six-foot-tall player for you.
You want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended me to quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon a championship win, Gausse will then contribute to the next one".
Gausse enjoyed the championship for the Los Vaqueros, but only from a distance, as he was already president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At the time, he wanted to focus on his duties and enjoy Mincy's place on the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in an Olympic qualifier in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have had bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw", Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was pretty much the same team that beat us to bronze at the World Championships.
This squad not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fica López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also included youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had the perfect lineup, but managed to win the gold medal and bring us great joy, was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualifiers in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players disqualified from the Mar de Plata Pan American Games, we won gold against all odds.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers in international tournaments are impressive.
No Puerto Rican has achieved the level of success that Piculin has.
Not to mention his involvement in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I'm very fond of Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest accomplishment in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early '90s, the National League had 17 teams in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like the division of youth categories by region.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music mostly, watch YouTube music videos from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been there for me.
The actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". on the television series Dallas, in which he portrayed a man who acted recklessly and was cunning and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the rapacious oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of hunger in the '80s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in the new Dallas series this year, died, according to an official family announcement provided to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon from complications related to cancer.
"Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he has once again played the iconic role he loved most", his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas with him for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman at the time of his death at Dallas Hospital", her agent Jeffrey Lane reported.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest", said Linda Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he himself admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, Hagman was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver, and he underwent a liver transplant.
Years before Dallas, Hagman made his name as a decent guy in the light-hearted comedy I Dream of Jeannie, which ran on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a genie) played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his home to live with him.
He also starred in two short-lived sitcoms, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film credits include the critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that brought him to the top of the stars.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other figures around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jay?" which was supposed to raise expectations for an emotional piece in which Hangman's character is nearly murdered, not only caused a huge amount of speculation from viewers around the world, but also risked millions of dollars at the box office.
This also helped the work to reach record viewership.
The November 1980 episode that revealed the answer averaged 41 million viewers, making Dallas the second most-watched entertainment program in history after MASH ended its run in 1983 with 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy man with a charismatic smile: a shrewd businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) committed to a mental institution.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his headstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honored citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world and in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second season have been completed and a sixth is in the works", the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, no statement was available from Warner or TNT about how the series would continue.
The Fort Worth, Texas, native was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who had a career in classical musicals such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth in 1931 to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950's, Larry tried his luck in the theater scene in New York City and then served in England from 1952 to 1956 with the Air Force.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in it that I knew would hurt or harm anyone", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became involved in promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital, helping fearful patients.
"I counsel them, I encourage them, I meet them when they go to surgery and after", he said in 1996.
I try to comfort them in the sense of "Don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be fine".
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course begins that explores "the end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew that it was an irresistible temptation: The end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, which was to come on December 21, was taken by many as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charme had no idea what lay ahead in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call "debt Armageddon", and the growing conflict that is dragging Israel into the place where, according to Christian doomsday theorists, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that ever was", Charme told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you're looking at what's going on in the world today, like we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad is good for apocalyptically minded people.
And he's not the only professor to offer a course on "the end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course on "Environments, Culture, and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're looking at why these ideas spread over time", he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war can break out.
This month, students are analyzing apocalyptic-themed movies and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, plausible and impossible", says Vacker.
On the main campus of Penn State University, Matthew Restall, professor of Latin American history, and his colleague Amara Solari, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to organize a course simply titled The End of the World.
"We don't connect to 2012 because we always count on the possibility of setting course again in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "threatening destruction", students have to study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very evening of the supposed end of the world", Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched into two hours", said Restall of his high-performing course, which had 35 students enrolled.
Weeks and weeks before the semester started, we got emails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Haddonfield, New Jersey, sociology and religion student at Rutgers University in Camden.
And so apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a classroom that could teach it", he said.
"I'm enjoying this".
But no confessed student, let alone professor, has said that he believes in the end date of December 21st.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and we're going to disprove it in a way", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar", Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back centuries, where people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused the spread of these speculations.
"Other people don't think about it", he said.
This is what happens in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond when asked if he knew of any course there on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", he wrote, indicating an exception to the highest authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many doomsdays had been talked about over the years, and he said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world would end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said they intended to attend the "end of the world" celebration.
"I think I'll call a few friends and we'll have a laugh together", explained 20-year-old communication student Samira Ford.
