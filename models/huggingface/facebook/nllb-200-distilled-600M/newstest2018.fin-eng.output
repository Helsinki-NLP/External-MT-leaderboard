Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with a mental illness, and now she's making art on the subject of "Man should have the right to his own body".
The Project Room Gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts has dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Deciding who he was for her.
"I wanted to share my personal history of care so that the violence of the process could be seen", says Auer.
In the process, he's referring to the process of sexual correction.
It is often a years-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be launched by sending to the 'gender identity disorder' diagnostic studies to be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
The Auer process started four years ago.
Before that, he had used estrogen he ordered online and was already in a very long process of his own repair.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process in order to have a legal right to have sex.
The Translact, the Law on the Establishment of Transgender Gender (563/2002) requires transgender people to be forced to sterilize in order to obtain the right gender, for example, in the population register and in the passport.
At present, every sex corrector is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive disability.
You have the right to choose your own body.
"This is an intolerable situation and a violation of human rights", says Auer.
The reform of the Transla law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight legal observations and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their rights to selfdetermination.
The previous government prepared a Finnish law amendment under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Susanne Huovisen.
The election came and the fundamentalists took over the government.
Now the law is back on the line.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this law at issue.
"The government does not want to bring it to the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law", says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty Finland's Finnish division.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of these is the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report facility, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist at the Tampere University Hospital for Transplantation on Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer's right to treatment and assistance.
The sense of reality under investigation seems to be prone to deterioration.
The self-examiner's perception of himself appears to be fragmented at a borderline level, and personality traits that are unstable are highlighted.
Auer didn't identify himself from these images.
"It was a shock to learn that I was diagnosed with a mental illness", says Auer.
Even more shocking was the fact that Auer was not given sex reassignment treatment.
The medical staff said he didn't have enough resources to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transponder into the TV's waiting room.
Later, this television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who's been defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but breast removal requires a diagnosis", says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything other than your birth-determined sex.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the sexual correction process is more difficult for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
It's a place where passersby meet dozens of people who need to justify their existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy to deny treatment to people who need help and support on the grounds that they don't have enough resources", says Auer.
Many people who participate in the process have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential experiences of bullying.
On these grounds, healthcare professionals may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Having to prevent treatment and assistance can put a person in an even worse situation than he was before the process began", says Auer.
Aure's own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the exhibition's text, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts all my adult life, and it is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started taking hormones, he felt better.
She had finally been able to express the feelings that had existed in her childhood and adolescence.
Why the broad chin didn't feel right for your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat.
What was important to Auer was that there were people around him who could see him.
I mean, being seen is a basic necessity.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dress, voice, and movement", he says.
Nowadays, Auer feels like she's already being seen. She exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, random comments from close friends could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when someone close to you has sex.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they don't want or can't internalize it", he continues.
However, not all transgender people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from bodysphoria, or body dysfunction, in which the body or parts of the body can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a lengthy research process, no formal confirmation of its sex can be obtained.
"There is no medical basis for these studies", says Auer.
And it is true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, the Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination as regards legal gender.
An adult applicant shall submit a written application for a new identity declaring that he or she feels to be of the opposite sex.
After a period of six months, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall issue a new identity card to the applicant.
This right of self-determination is also demanded in Finland and is also reflected in the Auer exhibition.
It's not a therapeutic experience for an artist, but it's a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art still has a value and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick from 4 to 28 July 2017 at the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The civil rights organization issued a travel warning to Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is blamed on the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks.
NAACP's Missouri Travel Report will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and urges African American travellers, visitors and locals to exercise special caution and extreme caution when traveling to the state where there have been numerous recent incidents of racial questioning, the organisation said in a statement.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to prosecute discriminatory cases, and the state's laws disproportionately target minorities, which the NAACP says led to travel warnings.
Human rights are being violated.
They are stopped for their skin color and are abused or killed, the Missouri chairman of the NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
We've never heard so many cases in such a short time.
The Missouri travel report is the organization's first warning to the United States.
The organization cited as examples the racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders of Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, while driving through the state, when his car ran out of fuel, and he was arrested by the Missouri State Police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel document also referred to a report by the Missouri Attorney General that police were 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
The purpose of the travel briefing is to urge people to be vigilant and to warn their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri, Chapel says.
People must prepare themselves, for example, by taking money with them to pay for the security or by telling their relatives that they are going to travel through the state.
According to the FBI, Missouri was the 16th most violent state in the United States in 2015.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for businesses to sue for discrimination in residence and employment.
The ACLU, a constitutional civil rights organization, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they approved immigration laws requiring police to arrest people for immigration violations, which the organization says adds to racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department and are intended for other countries, but in recent times, NGOs have issued them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Links with Finnair on the supplementary pension of the CEO
The Minister of Economy, Mika Lintilä (Central), responsible for State ownership management, has asked Finnair to report on the additional pension payment received by Pekka Vauramon, the airline's CEO.
The minister said it was contrary to the government's will.
The additional pension of €130,000 received by Vauramon was raised this week when the Helsinki Gazette announced the reward offer for the directors of publicly traded companies.
The Finnish daily Kuva newspaper reported that Vauramo was retiring in February.
Finnair said that he would retire from the additional pension in 2013.
The government has made it clear that no additional pensions are used to pay the salaries.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
The company said that the decision was in line with the ownership decision of last year.
The sanctions immediately tightened the conversation.
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
The meeting of the G20 in Hamburg between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be a good one.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions passed by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with a sharp reaction in Russia.
The most shocking response so far has been Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said Trump's refugee law represents a "complete trade disaster".
Even if Russian reactions were to be seen as a political rhetoric of extremes and excesses, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact shortly after the Trump election.
In the United States, the passage of a refugee lawsuit involving Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
While the Congress passed the bill with considerable unanimous approval, the president was told that passing the bill was much more difficult.
Trump also criticized the law he signed as "significantly flawed".
President Trump's knife-wielding is likely to have been primarily the result of Russia, although the passage of a law restricting his own powers must have been repugnant.
As is well known, the United States is investigating Russia's possible interference in the presidential election and Trump's campaign's ties to Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a reality after a short period of decline.
With the White House staff changing steadily and the disclosure of scandalous twists and turns, it is becoming increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not being conducted under the leadership of the president but despite the president.
This is not a situation that is desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a stalemate in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to the economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is also straining relations.
The EU has made clear the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
While the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the surface, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland, which has a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real waste.
The effects of the recent U.S. escape are still unclear.
The EU has feared that the sanctions will hamper the operations of many European companies.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
The European Union has been transformed by the exclusion of liquefied natural gas, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics to express resentment.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and meticulous.
Otherwise, they're more likely to do us more harm than good.
Nothing is sacred anymore?
The Trump White House is now facing the Freedom House.
Interfering with the old man is a sure sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: Iraqis collapsed with American soldiers on Saddam Hussein's stables in Firdous Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the top ideologues in the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta, and the Freedom Fighter was the target of Miller's attack in a speech that touched on the president's proposal to dramatically reduce legal immigration.
Miller wasn't really critical of the statue itself.
If he had, he would have been attacked by huge flocks of crusader organizers and figures imitating the Land of Liberty.
His attack was on the importance of the stake and in particular the fact that in 1903 the stake was added to his leg by the poem Emma Lazarus  17 years after graduating from the stake.
Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to go into the history of it, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller was not wrong in his own way, but it's not just history, as he himself said.
The only words of Lazarus's touch are important, the only ones of their kind in which the state invites not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore".
The poem is more relevant now than ever.
Miller was not a literary critic, but he made it clear that the poorest of the poor were not welcome in Trump's United States.
The debate over the significance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural debate over the significance of the United States.
After Lazarus' death, his friends campaigned for a poem to be put on his thigh, knowing well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the Patz was to express the connections between French and American republicanism in a classic metaphor, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the word: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it's giving itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
The inclusion of the poem in the picture was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the staff, and the right has long wanted to restore it to its original meaning.
Rush Limbaugh  the trailblazer, now considered some sort of Trump prophetic  claimed in 2010 that the Freedom House is not inviting anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives who is leading the United States' flame to cover the world with darkness: Lady Liberty steps forward.
He's taking the flame of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The road to the United States is not clear.
Unusually, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the perspective.
Lazarus saw it as poor and tired but hopeful immigrants aboard a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His banner of freedom comforts us by giving hope and welcome.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their flame does not lead the way, but it ignites the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black congratulates the Scottish national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made the England national team.
Neil Black, the UK's sporting union's chief executive, says the 16 Scotsmen on the World Cup team are a "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Cup in London on Friday.
Mr Black said there was something special going on in Scotland that the sport in the UK should learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake", says Black.
I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the work of the institute.
The Scottish Sports Association believes that it is linked to the organisation's activities,
And the British Sports Federation believes that their work is behind it.
And the average street person thinks he must have something to do with it.
But there is something really great about it, and that's where it comes from.
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres, and Eilidh Doyle, who was named captain of the national team.
Eilidh is unnecessarily unpretentious.
"His captain's speech was incredibly wonderful", Black says.
 Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and highly motivated no matter where they lived and trained.
Yesterday's words were a real feeling and passion for sports.
Eilidh Doyle is the Commonwealth silver medalist in the 400m hurdles, and this is her fifth World Cup, and she thinks it's unusual for the Scottish national team to have 16 players.
The previous record was set in seven years, 1983 and 2015.
Mid-season runner Laura Muir has set five British and two European records in one year.
He's competing in London in the 1,500m and 5,000m.
Chris O'Hare is running the 1,500 metres in London, and he's also worth watching for: he's having an excellent season, including wins at the World Championships and the Anniversary Games in Great Britain.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scottish national team to add to his numbers was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is very proud to have so many Scots in attendance, some of whom are really competing for final places and medals.
To be made captain is a great honour, but even more special is the fact that the members of the national team voted for the captain, Doyle says.
I'm, of course, very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They're in it as deserving athletes competing for the prize money.
My captain's speech?
I think it went pretty well.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home.
It's important to enjoy the support of the local public and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be incredibly beautiful.
Blocking Facebook Critics: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our father knew what bad publicity was.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began to criticize him for any possible domestic politics, including his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led foolishly and silently like sheep to the slaughter", Washington said in 1783.
And that's what's gonna get us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their presenters.
The American Civil Rights Association challenged Hogan's law earlier this week.
His staff dismissed the challenge as unfounded, and the attitude was downright downright downright online.
What does it matter? This is just Facebook, so many comments.
But it matters.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He's got the second highest rating among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not a very sensitive person to heat.
He's been a steady leader of the state, and he's been a firm believer in principles.
She has also used Facebook as her main channel of communication with voters and posted a photo of her bald head undergoing chemotherapy.
That's why blocking users from the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous, because the governor's page is a public and official forum run by his staff with tax dollars.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with The Washington Post, saying it was just moderation of comments.
But labeling commenters as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed some of the users that Hogan blocked on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they had chosen, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and practical.
The pastor borrowed the Bible from his comments; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate speech and other recent news", he wrote in the Washington Post news commentary.
 I cannot accept that when several people comment on the same subject, they are immediately seen as a group in some way organized and are ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.
The governor's staff called the comments a "cross-attack" someone else might call them to promote what they considered important.
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to control communication by blocking a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines or arrest and silence protesters.
But it's really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of linking to Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users who were blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on this matter was made last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheriksen of the Alexandria Circuit Court, the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Rights Association was in talks with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington, D.C., cheap mail had a similar effect to the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers were mocking Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers, criticizing Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with appeals criticizing the Jay Agreement, the United States-United Kingdom Agreement on cooperation, trade and maritime transport, as evidenced by the papers collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression are the cornerstones of our nation.
Real leadership means accepting this fact.
The birds should stop feeding them in the summer immediately.
Samples have come from about a dozen places, and online notifications from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern and vernacular Finland, but then also from the Cape and Seinäjo, says specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evir.
The spider's chicken has died of a disease called trichomoniasis.
It is caused by a primate called Trichomonas gallinae.
It's been known to strike the hips, especially the eyebrows.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also detected in poultry.
In 2009, it was a pretty good year.
At that time, the tricomonous was a major cause of the collapse of the Finnish greenhouse, after which the species has been recovering.
There have been sick greenhouses now, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, museum director at the Helsinki University's Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Creation).
The fear is that the previous greenhouse gas epidemic will recur unless something is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop feeding the birds summer food immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of his home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of his home advantage over the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, a Northern Irish international, led the tournament at the nearby Archerfield Links last year before the final but lost to Paul Eales, who has chosen a new venue and is the tournament ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I watched the Renaissance Club build, and with this event it will be in full glory", says Rafferty.
The players can see the field at its best.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a passionate ambassador for the game, and he's proud of what he's accomplished here.
The tournament is a great introduction to the arena.
England's Eales is defending the championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a very special occasion", says a player from Southport.
I was unable to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember last year, winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.
Gary Orr is back on his own soil, and he joined the tour earlier this year on his 50th birthday.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Gaming at home is always more meaningful than usual", says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far.
The three will be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is contested by six Scotsmen: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The cost of parking a car is £5 for a driver only and £10 for at least two people.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
The scarecrow investigated any indoor air problems.
At least so far, no internal air problems have been found in the shallow ports of the Porte brigade post company's barracks building, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
The internal air investigation is ongoing.
The investigation began when a man who had suspended his maintenance service for health reasons felt that his health had deteriorated because of the bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holman, the Chief of Staff of the Porry Brigade, there were no reported health problems among the other officers.
It turned out that this was an individual case and that no other staff in that unit had had any health problems.
Every report is taken seriously and we wanted to get this straight.
At this time, it is not known whether we have any indoor air conditioning problems, says Holma.
The Prikaat communication states that due to the arrival of goods in the barracks in July, the goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have led to a temporary increase in dust.
The air may have seemed to be clogged, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn't use the helmet in the kitchen.
He rarely uses a cat.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotala, the capital of the Pania region, in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia.
In half an hour, the burnt potatoes on the carrot are eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
Dege's house is empty, and he sits on a different kind of painting, where he usually also does his daily errands, like taking a bathroom bath in the same water drawn from a nearby sink.
The office of the store is to deliver a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of his husband's four wives, and he has no assigned fields to manage.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
"No one dares walk into the village after five in the evening", Degei says.
This is a rare sight in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which tightly controls the area and prevents foreign journalists and human rights monitors from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua.
Enarotali is remote and bumpy, starting with a one-and-a-half-hour flight from the provincial capital of Jayapur to Nabire and continuing with a five-hour drive in a rented car.
There's no public transportation here.
The city of about 19,000 people has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees, the corrosion of which has stained the waves of the waves into clockwork.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone reporters and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribe of Papua worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have any of these clothes", Degei says, "meaning a colorful, hand-woven, knitted headband, dark brooch and brightly colored sweater".
Before we had only leaves to cover our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy rates are among the highest in Asia.
But it's also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is a mountainous area about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000 people, and just over a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, headquartered in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, the Papuans have an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
However, for the Papuan people, these riches are a pity, for they represent the oppressive presence of Indonesia's strong army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly $20 million in 1998-2004, with individual officers being paid up to $150,000.
Papuan demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are relentlessly silenced.
Human rights activists say that since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 papuan people and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission for Human Rights, mass killings in the upper reaches of the Papuan tribes in the 1970's were proportional to genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the region during peaceful protests.
The 2016 report by the Brisbane Archdiocese of We Will Lose Everything reports on past year's atrocities, including executions without trial, torture  rape and electrocution are particularly popular means  and ruthless attacks on peaceful protests.
It is difficult to calculate the number of deaths because there are cases every week says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia at Human Rights Watch.
The food has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million people, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as Indonesian populations from Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi migrate to the region in hopes of a better life.
The warung food stores in Java sell fried chicken and a mixture of gado-gado in a peanut butter sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market for less than local prices says Abeth You, 24, from Pania, who moved to the provincial capital for work.
Local women lost their client.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi, pledged to address the injustices and human rights abuses in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential capital.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice", You says.
The pania experienced some kind of wave-bottom just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the river in Enarotala on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use the traffic lights.
Another soldier disliked the remark, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebain, the man returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses reported that drunk soldiers seized the children and beat them with rifle barrels.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, died in a coma as a result of abuse.
A few hours later, the state electoral board building near the scene caught fire, and it started happening the next day.
About a thousand papuan men, women, and children gathered at the football stadium in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
They carried with them festival-style hunting dances, and they began performing the traditional Waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, which is danced in the ring and mimicked the song of birds.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
As the mood heated up, the soldiers received an order on an internal radio system: If the troops resist more than three times, shoot them to death. The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident of Kego Koto, foreshadowed the situation and urged the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist", he told TIME magazine, "a brightly painted wooden porch in his house".
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
Several shots were fired in the expansion zone.
Alfius Youvia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shooting.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him", John told TIME magazine sadly.
I saw that he was dead, and I kissed him.
Papua Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only protected the police station because it was the target of the attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papua police spokesman, in 2015.
Then it's life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killing was reported in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a heartfelt speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to intervene in the violence in Papua.
I want an immediate investigation so that nothing like this ever happens again.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations into human rights abuses outside the justice system.
But he immediately began to withdraw.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but that requires certain processes, he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind.
"Everything will be settled in court", he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of crimes against humanity.The crimes are linked to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999.Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Panay.
The families of the Pania victims are responding to the allegations with a dark disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but nothing has progressed", says Johannes.
I'm already tired of this.
He says he still lives in fear, even years after the events.
"Yes, I am afraid", he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panian people are not afraid to discuss what happened.
He says that the soldiers had abused him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"The military is looking for me after the burial of the victims", he says.
The shooting's not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Deiya neighborhood of Pania.
One person was killed and 17 injured in a clash between the villagers and the head of a construction company, which began when the head refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man who needed medical attention was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers showed their affection on the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said villagers were stoning police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on a crowd, killing one of the villagers.
"We are terrified, afraid of retaliation", says Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being brought to the hospital.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The parliament of Deiya has called for the firing of police officers and the withdrawal of a mobile police force from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the rugged middle-lying areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuan citizens through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Paniais, like Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the uprising by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of securing national sovereignty.
Some of those arrested never come back.
Among the Papists, Paniai is known as a sad, forgotten place.
Poverty feeds discontent.
There's only a small amount of rice for sale at the Enarotala, and it's too expensive for locals,
Like bread.
People grow their own food: mostly potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and one woman can have four or five potatoes.
Most of the rain is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in living standards between locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce, and they usually go to local, better educated and richer immigrants.
Only a few parrots have sufficient capital and the ability to run their own business competitively.
"Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money", says John Gobai, president of the Paniain Tribal Council.
The Papua New Guinea is not getting much attention.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite having been granted a rare permit to film, for official reasons, due to their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, increased transparency and promoted progress by removing restrictions on news.
Reporters reporting from Papua and West Papua, Indonesia's most troubled eastern provinces, face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting, China said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure from Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific States  Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands  called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the widespread and numerous violations in Papua, including the Panjabi shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported the liberation movement in Papua.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch delegation, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, a source told AFP.
Indonesia is in the 2019 presidential election, but the papas say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi any more.
"Jokowi means well, but he's surrounded by people who have been involved in the Panjin shooting", says Gobai, the tribal council president.
He wants Jokowi to know the plight of Paniaans: they live under the rule of greed and an unpredictable army, in shortage and poverty, practically without health care and education.
According to Gobai, the Paniaans, like other Papuan people, consider the vote they gave Jokowi a debt to be repaid.
They don't want money, they just want justice, he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Panjin shooting once again symbolically resisted: they buried one of the victims on the ground opposite the police station and the army station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family was murdered", Yacobus says, "with a head in the air.
What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora is shouting about Robert Helenius' cancellation of the re-match: "Even his own fans don't want to see it".
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to take the field at Hartwall Arena on May 27.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora is in a recent interview with IFL TV, blaming the entire failure of the re-match on Heleneus.
My game in Finland failed, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland. I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him take it because he's a bad guy, Chisora's a nuisance.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match by a controversial score.
The ticket sales for the new match went on a heady schedule, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Night Snows in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
There's nothing new about the game.
But the resignation will no longer be a shock to Chisora.
The fact is that the match would probably have to be cancelled after Chisora became ill.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up in pain.
My truck was about to explode.
They told me at the hospital that I had to be cut, Chisora says.
Britti says she's in about 45 percent condition right now.
He's not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but he's interested in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat to White in December.
You came to repeat your power in Dubai with the Torch Cloud Draper.
On Friday, fires swept through the world's tallest residential building in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee a 337-meter-high 79-story building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called the Torch, a flame.
The building was evacuated, and no one was known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was not immediately understood.
We were asleep and woke to the sound of a fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes", a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue officials, firefighters were able to put out the fire at 4 a.m. local time and remained in the building to cool down.
The government has announced that it will arrange accommodation for those who have left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
The Torch Building Board conducted an investigation after the 2015 fire, which found that the discs used for the cover and insulation of the public page suffered the most damage.
In Britain, police believe that the insulation and shutters at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fires in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
A motorcycle was stolen from a riverfront parking lot during the night.
The motorcycle was stolen from the Rijensula parking lot between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.

More than 20 percent of U.S. air travelers take prohibited items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air travelers revealed that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto planes past the U.S. Traffic Safety Administration (TSA) checkpoints.
Less than one percent said that they only learned later that they had mistakenly transported weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey, which was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, and which was conducted by more than 1,000 passengers, also revealed that young passengers are more likely to challenge the rules than others.
The Commission also found that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a legal basis for the assessment of the compatibility of the measures.
Most often, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids on a plane.
More than three percent admitted to knowingly taking steel-equipped items onto the plane, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men reported knowingly taking banned drugs onto the plane.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States, and the company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally passed a security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that the majority of travellers are also more likely to pass through security checks  knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the survey company notes, the TSA's guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Often, passengers do not know what liquids to take on board or how much to take.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquid.
For a time, the government also held that books should not be carried on planes.
You can take liquids on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt , director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , has reversed his decision to delay the Obama-era decisions to reduce emissions .
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, director of the EPA, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the smoke-reducing decisions made during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he heads takes better account of the needs of the environmental decision-makers in the Länder.
Pruitt did not mention the action brought against his earlier decision in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Member States should start complying with the 2015 standard for surface ozone as from 1.10.2015.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year so that his office would have more time to familiarize itself with the plan, as the Agency did not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth.
Pruitt was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the EPA's Director, and Pruitt is known for his opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest blow to Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA's director had exceeded his authority in trying to delay the oil and gas companies from enforcing the Obama administration's decision, which required companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In its statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his complete amendment to the ozone regulations only strengthens EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on schedule.
In the years of the administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the right to reach agreement on the timetable, Pruitt said.
We do not believe in the regulation of the courts and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and its powers to us.
However, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to use its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
The Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, which was adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the proposal.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York State Attorney General who led the EPA's coalition of states that filed suit this week, said the group plans to continue the pressure.
"The change of mind that we are bringing in the EPA is a major gain for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smoke in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ozone is produced when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This smoke can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups and is a contributing factor in the thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists were pleased with Pruitt's sudden change of direction.
"It is disturbing how much pressure was required to make the guy responsible for our breathing environment use common sense", says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
We must fight back against the Trump administration, which has an ideological aim of operating on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups.
The conversion of the supercar manufacturer to a road-going driver "is a Ferrari-style car".
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a press conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar maker presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of Eastern Savo ashtrays of the same virus type
The coastal ash ash plague is the same virus as the previous cases in East Java, THL reports.
The Department of Health and Welfare's Virology Lab confirmed Thursday that the fifth ashes of the Eastern Cape are the same virus as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the ash ash ash infection confirmed on Friday 28 July in a coastal person is the same virus type as the previous cases in East Java.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in Eastern Savoy are related to the first ashtray detected in the region in June.
The good news is that we've not seen any other types of ashes.
However, it is possible that new infections may emerge from the fifth patient's trail by mid-August and the epidemic may not be over yet, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, Soster's primary health care infectious diseases officer.
No new ash ashtrays or suspected ashtrays have been identified since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-dateness of their own vaccine protection, Erkki reminds.
More on the topic: Three new ashtrays confirmed in the drylands - "Extra-severe or epidemic highly unlikely"
Finland prepares for a permissive scream
The Pontota soup was not even considered legal.
The reason behind this is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, alongside wine.
Making a home-made screech is legal next year, but they're not even considering legalizing a ponti dish.
The screw is made by rolling, the pontic is made by distilling.
The regulation of the wine is based on the fact that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, alongside wine.
There is no political will to establish a pontifical soup as a right of the people, the government council, Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, commented.
When the Minister prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of pontifices was not considered legal.
Nor was the matter brought to the political table.
The Commission has not yet decided on the implementation of the measures.
He's on the negotiating panel of the governing parties' congressional committees that took a stand on alcohol reform.
The promise of a pontiac to distill at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial production shall also remain subject to authorisation.
The judgment states that the home-based production of alcoholic beverages will be governed by a simple rule: alcohol must be made at home.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can now legally scream at home.
The government has been trying to simplify the regulations.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavoring and flavoring and allows for screaming, making it more accurate.
The preparation must still be such that the raw materials or flavourings produced by them are clearly visible in the drink.
The new law says you can make as many drinks as you want and you can give away your own alcohol as a gift.
It's not for sale anymore.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, the judges believe.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger traffic from Estonia and other EU countries was released.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will be debated in the House of Representatives as soon as the fall season begins.
The full session is 5.9.
The law will go into effect in early 2018.
The law is well-prepared.
It's like the House has already taken a stand.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to the hospital by armed guards.
A chest painter, Oscar Pistorius, was admitted to a South African hospital on suspicion of heart attack.
Pistorius's already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of her girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February of 2013.
Litter-based phone conversations reveal Trump 's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall .
The Washington Post has leaked footage of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end his public speech by saying that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States has been making the assumption that this has publicly blown up the wall project.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a littering of Trump's first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which there was a heated exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbully that the deal that the United States would take in refugees on their way to Australia was "laughable, sad and stupid", and that a deal negotiated during the Obama administration would make him look "stupid" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbully that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.
Georgia Massacre: Activists re-enact a racist lynching in the hope of justice
A Ford Mercury passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey to the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car can reach the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and squeezes through a windshield.
The passengers are scared.
Roger, the man is leaving.
Get out of the car!
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
This shocking event is fortunately just a reboot that was presented on July 22, 2017.
However, the shock groans are real when the hanging eyelid is worn around the neck of Roger.
Human rights groups have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge since 2005 to re-enact the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It's a mystery that no one has been arrested over the years, even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the rescue.
It's the shameful cycle of history, but above all it's a burden that weighs on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
To him, the restoration is a startling call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want the guilty to be brought to justice, we want things to be finally settled, and we want to recover from the grief and make amends, but above all, we want justice", Brooks says.
We can't recover and reconcile until we get justice.
A coroner's office covers the body of a victim of the Georgia massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, the lynching was suspected of involving more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been out for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Supreme Court of Georgia granted black citizens the right to vote for the first time in a presidential election, which was decided by the Supreme Court in April, and held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident where a black tenant farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was a rumor in town that Hester had been having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child for her.
According to the FBI, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcolm $600 bail on July 25, 1946, for which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car in front of Moore's Ford Bridge.
It's been revealed that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders, the FBI report says.
It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, which were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identities of the witnesses.
Brooks is the most profound.
"It was a vote-getter murder", he says.
They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that the same thing would happen to them if they voted.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgia massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and captivating, and it is a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe is already gone in the United States of America.
It's hard to watch a show, but even harder not to see what Green says is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark side", says the director.
But I can't relate to you if you don't listen to me or want to hear what I've been through.
This year's rehearsal began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors from a dozen black and 20 white people gathered to listen to Green's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director on Green.
He's been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader in the remake for years, but the role is always as difficult and repugnant.
"It makes me feel dirty because I'm not myself", Marbaugh says.
It is important, however, that this side of history is also kept in mind so that it is never repeated.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are practicing their lectures.
The show starts with Malcolm screaming and banging Heather, and he's furious that Hester's been having an affair with Dorothy.
I told you to get out of my country, n--u!
Rascona, or Hester, is the answer.
Then the punch comes.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
What?! Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Was I too strong in the accident?" he asks.
- What? - Not yet.
I just don't think the whites used the word "n"...
Yes, another black actor confirms.
It's a slang term, you have to use a longer version.
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room is also powerful for a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who died.
The assignment starts over.
Now Rasconas words are going away.
No one laughs.
The restoration will end quickly and violently.
Screaming, firing, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies singing Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
Her voice breaks every second she says it.
A few hundred yards away, fifty spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half the audience is black and half white.
There's a couple in the group who've come to see the show from Ithaca, New York, but most of them are local.
They've been to the graves of the victims in Georgia's pressing humidity, under the guidance of Brooks.
The murders have become a story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites a crowd to examine the bodies.
The children will stare at the fake classmates and the still bodies and whisper to each other.
They're not really dead. The little boy is muttering as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will be thanking the audience.
The actors who played the lynchmen would strip their sign and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh, a local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after the punishment performance.
It's okay, the woman who was on the show is a comfort to me.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and the cast will gather for a dinner together.
A white couple from Altania are having a lively discussion about the show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinsky is hard to find words to describe the feelings that the show brings.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch terrible things people say and do that look like you do because they look like you do", she says.
A performance showed that lynchings continue to take place, he added.They are simply called arrests.
On the other side of the room, Brooks is reminding the audience of civil rights for those sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started planning his next year's show.
"Re-enactment is a powerful experience because it portrays the horrors we experience, but it's also an educational experience", says Brooks.
 Its message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.
The fact that plants are suspended in shops is alarming: removing these 'excess parts' actually saves money.
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of the flower buds at the store before weighing?
What about taking a big hat off the pineapple, no matter how much weight it weighs?
The answers are very divided: for one, it is an indication of extreme odor, while for others, it is a sign of unwillingness to pay for vegetables that are not used and are thrown away at home.
The sign is recognizable in the shops.
For example, in the vegetable department of K-Citimarket in Helsinki's Herbal Gulf, you can find coffee cans because many people tear off the leaves of the flower bed.
The leaves are taken out of the box and taken to the bio-waste store.
According to the Economic News, the smelling of vegetable juices is surprising to traders.
But how much money does removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save?
How significant is the smoking pill really?
We women tested how the price changed when we took or removed leaves from pineapple, lettuce, candy, and corn and flower.
Flower basket: The price of a €2.10 flower basket was €1.80 when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, which cost EUR 2.30, dropped to EUR 1.95 when its position was reversed.
The price of the short position decreased from EUR 2,60 to EUR 2,40 when the short position was discontinued.
Two candy bars cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stakes, it was 60 cents.
A medium-sized barley barley costs 1 euro and a half a pound [80 cents] without a handle.
The result: If you start to tear leaves and stems apart, save at best a few tens of cents on one hatch.
In percentage terms, the price of hate fell by as much as 20%.
So I would have saved a total of 1.20 euros on these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona . The Brazilian signed a five-year contract with PSG .
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French club PSG, AFP news agency reports.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who play in the Spanish football league.
The transfer fee of 222 million euros is the largest in the history of football.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros last summer for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league had held back the transfer earlier Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first pay campaign.
Under the league's rules, the buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who have supplied the money to Barcelona through the league.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to the new home crowd at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA is looking into details
The Commission has also decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take appropriate measures to ensure that the measures are taken in accordance with the rules laid down in the Treaty.
The Spanish Premier League President Javier Tebas has, among other things, suspected that PSG was violating the rules of the UEFA financial fair game by its use of money.
UEFA can penalise a company that loses more than €30 million over three years.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its financial rules.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG will have an impact on the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for a significant sum, UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a Qatari state-owned company.
The association is chaired by former tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, was burned to death by a slime attack. The sealing was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing regular work on a plane at South Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly a thunderbolt from the rainy sky struck the plane.
The force of the salamanca threw the plane's wing into the ground near Dunne.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother had an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if she was alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a hard experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
The airport representative said that the risk warning system was in place at the time of the incident and the transport operator would decide whether to follow it.
Pearson will cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting a portion
British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3 000 jobs and cut its share by 72% when it launched a new structural management programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to the CEO John Fallon, the main job cuts will be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, where the company has already lost 4 000 jobs in the context of previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive the business that had been weakened by rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, a partner in the company, which announced it would keep its outlook for the year ahead steady, with revenue rising by a percentage point in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military base in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
According to the NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local information, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Kabul Qarabagh region.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, killing 30 people in a mosque blast in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to the NATO statement, the explosion on Thursday night occurred when a joint patrol of NATO and Afghan forces was attacked by a man carrying a homemade explosive device.
The statement said that all the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
The correspondents said the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including 20% in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, a region predominantly populated by Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in downtown Kabul, the country's deadliest militant group attack since US-led forces seized power from the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help local military and police.
The correspondents also said that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, its policies and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA is reversing its decision to postpone implementation of smoke control regulations
The EPA reversed its decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's smoke-reducing decisions the day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called 'Zotexposure' on Wednesday late, indicating its commitment to cooperate with the states.
'We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the States', said Director Scott Pruitt in the Agency's statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone specifications by one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 major Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, claiming that the suspension was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has been looking for ways to ease the environmental regulations that Barack Obama had in place, and Trump says the measures are part of a broader economic growth agenda.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA's website, breathing ozone-containing air could impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior figure in the ISI also sent bomb parts to Sydney.
Suspicions were that the bomb was to be flown on July 15, but the operation was stopped before a security check.
The police are not going to give us a detailed explanation as to why the operation was stopped.
The second plan of the terrorists was to build a device to emit toxic colorless gas and to carry it to a public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist scheme was one of the most professional schemes ever undertaken in Australia.
Four men were arrested on Saturday night at police stations for suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation is ongoing.
The CEO of Neste: Renewable fuels performed well
The company's pre-tax profit fell, but it beat forecasts for the second quarter.
According to the CEO Matti Lievosen, the company was doing well in its oil products, sales of renewable products were rising to record levels and the marketing & services segment was moving in the right direction.
Last year, comparable business earnings were improved by the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit tax credit.
According to Lievosen, the turnover of renewable products remained good this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax exemption was terminated.
Our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017", Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss a possible match on their first meeting.
Vasylomatsenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the upcoming most exciting boxing match in the under-66.7-pound series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN Sports Channel's offices in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatchenko, the WBO's top featherweight champion.
Garcia won Saturday at Showtime by unanimous decision of former world heavyweight champion Adrien Broner, after which Garcia and Lomatchenko have been among the top five boxers in the mixed-heavyweight division.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, Master?
Good luck with the game!
Lomatchenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 p.m. on Saturday.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomatšenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that the men's match would be perfect for the "sizes".
I'm a former featherweight, Garcia recalled.
I moved the series up for the Bronze, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small man, weighing 63.5 pounds.
I want to get back to the lightweight division.
He's got to get up on the lightweight, and then we can take it.
That's what our fans want.
Let's make their wishes come true.
Lomatchenko agreed with me.
The competition needs this match.
Klimas asked if the match should be organised via pay-per-view channel, as part of his strategy for Lomatchenko, which said Lomatchenko would debut in the lightweight division later this year and will fight Garcia next summer (370, 30 jailed wins).
"It could be a pay channel because fans have asked for it", Garcia said, later announcing that he was ready to fight the channel that offers the best prize package.
We are the most interesting names.
No one else is getting as much attention.
I'm fine with that as soon as we get to a deal...
Garcia said he appreciated Lomashenko as an unrivaled fighter and that he might go to the game on Saturday.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's compliment on the weight class and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked really slow.
Garcia said he's focused on showing off his strength first, then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was being made ever stronger.
This is the match we've been waiting for.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case, Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to be able to fight the best.
It's gonna be a great game.
Average salary of EUR 5 300, training whatever it takes - the situation of investment advice was 'wilder and free'
The quality of investment advice has been a big hit lately.
Last time, the Helsinki Gazette reported on Ritva, 68, to whom the investment adviser for the banking industry spoke in a big way when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advice and the sale of various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The restrictions are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be implemented from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is currently based mainly on self-regulation.
The law doesn't define the skills requirements.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in investment services take their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of the examinations for a firm called APV Investments Studies Oy, whose examination group includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The examinations are of a scope of 12-15 credits and are drawn up by Aalto EE, the company that provides management development services.
Its website reports that, in general, both exams are "quite broad in terms of requirements".
The study materials for the studies include 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
According to Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investments Studies Oy, the passing rate of the examinations is roughly around 70 percent of the estimates.
The majority of the staff of the largest banks have either completed an APV1 or an APV2 qualification, as this is required by the companies' own rules.
Then there are smaller banks, not to mention the names of those whose staff seem to have refused to take their degrees, Savikko says.
He said that such banking transactions are "changing".
According to Savikon, 13 000-14 000 people have completed the APV1 qualification since 2000 and around 3 000 have completed the more demanding APV2 qualification recommended for investment advisers.
Some banking firms consider graduation an advantage.
There are many other industries with significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Finance Ministry requires the completion of the APV certificates, since this is where the investment-related expertise is ensured.
According to the Statistical Office, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, nature allowances and earnings.
The average monthly salary for regular working hours is around EUR 5 300.
Men in the job earn on average a large sum of EUR 5 900 per month and women more than EUR 4 500 per month.
The top ten earners earn an average of about EUR 8,100.
One tenth of the highest earners earn more than EUR 9 000 a month or more, and one tenth of the highest earners earn EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act may only be provided by a licensed company.
The level of staff and duties has so far relied on self-regulation.
According to FIVA, the audit was conducted in individual cases where the professional and competence of the investment advisor was insufficient in view of the activity of the advisor.
In principle, you can also be an investment product seller, even if you have a high level of professional skills and qualifications.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free in this respect.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements, Savikko notes.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should adopt a new financial framework for the implementation of the new financial markets directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each firm is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
Financial Supervisory Authority, in turn, is empowered to determine what it needs to know.
Marco Hovi, FIVA's market supervisor, explains that one of the clear changes to the current one is the requirement for the skills and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
The Court considers that the new requirements apply to both the own staff of investment firms and to the liaison officers who sell products on behalf of an investment firm.
The Court also stated that the Government's proposal from the Ministry of Finance suggests that Fiva be empowered to impose a mandate on the knowledge and experience.
From what they are, we'll see what they are in the autumn.
The company will also continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and supplementary training.
This must be documented and the company has an obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The Court notes that in practice, for example, a company must record the activities of its staff at an individual level.
This will certainly have different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
Hov said that the new requirement is also to work with someone more experienced for a fixed period of time if the level of knowledge or experience is not adequate.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
The Court believes that the change will tighten and make the rules more concrete.
The Commission will also consider the possibility of a new investment strategy to be implemented.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane crashes into a giant plane over the United States
The flight path of the aircraft was mapped over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted on Thursday on a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the durability of its Rolls Royce engines over long haul.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew for 15,700 kilometers in 18 hours and 1 minute, the longest of any commercial scheduled flight in the world.
The flight was held within the borders of the United States for the entire journey.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
The stubborn beach students of Imatra are not tolerated by rain or sunshine.
The oldest of all things was moving at a good pace, with the secret of tears.
The coastal schools of Imatra will be running in Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even if it rains and then it glows, young swimmers are not a moss, praises swimming school teacher Taina Tekonen.
In total, 13 children are swimming in swimming schools this week, and 10 next week.
The number of children next week was affected by the fact that school and school were already beginning, Tears said.
The Imatra Regional School is a joint project of the Movement to Connect the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the weather was nice on the Liette beach.
The sun was shining, and the young swimming school students were training to stay on the surface with their swimming boots, someone already out.
The little sisters were also entertained in the water.
The oldest of all, 5, first thought of going deeper.
But Tina Tear encouraged him to walk toward the beach.
It's going great!
Ienes Kaikkonen said he's been swimming a lot this summer.
She thinks the beach is good.
"The Lord is the One who is the Father, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, the Son, and the Holy Spirit", (Jn.
You should be happy with today's achievements, too.
Jamie Kallio, 4, once again wanted water.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swimming on the beach, considers the coastal school a good start to swimming lessons.
Even though the weather has been bad, Anna has been enjoying coming here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swim school boys packed up on the deck.
The boys had enough of the frog found on the beach.
Milja Halukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the table, grabbed fruit and baked the day.
The water was already teaching, but the boat was in no hurry.
It's like when you're not in the summer.
An unknown soldier is selling toiletries. "This is such a unifying story".
You can see it all the time.
Sinituote, a cleaning products company, launched the Unknown Soldier series a few days ago.
I mean, brushes and laundry detergents and "toilet brush on the edge".
An unknown soldier is referring to a movie and a marketing campaign that will premiere this fall.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been taunted on social media: When will the Unknown Health Connections come?
I need to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Blue Products' deputy chief executive Aino Määttä say?
We're the film's associates.
We're supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and a cult film, says Määttä.
He says that the products will be specially designed to be sold and that the film will be seen.
Isn't there something a little funny about this -- often when you think that the products and the stories they tell have something in common?
There is such a unifying story here that we are Finnish operators and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same Finnish values as those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture, Mutt points out.
Other business partners in the film The Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's viches have been introduced on the market under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been banned by Kalle Kinnunen, a blogger at the Finnish photo magazine
We've got coffee and watches already.
Kinnunen points out that there's still time for the premiere of the film, so the sequel is still in the works.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example Valio, Petroleum, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, writes Kinnunen.
New results of age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published
The latest results of the medical age tests of Swedish asylum seekers have been published, and the results of the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were over the age of 18.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Agency was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Migration Agency has so far carried out 6 880 tests and the Forensic Services Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
In addition, in 25 cases, the Office of Forensic Science determined that the test subject was possibly 18 years of age or older.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is possibly under 18 years of age.
The tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the age of the applicant.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Office, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent, and there is no significant difference between the figures for the previous months", he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified as being over 18, this does not necessarily mean that they had lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were indications that the subject was 18 years of age or older.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he had turned 18 this year.
The medical age-assessment method used in the tests is to take X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the kneecaps, and then to analyze the images by dentists and radiologists.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Carolinas Institute, whose work includes an assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether a person has a normal breakdown sooner or later.
I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the method used is the right one.
The biological age of this species is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told the Metro.
However, the Forensic Service's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: It can generally be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest when the test subject is about 18 years old, at which point the risk is about 10%.
Happiness has fallen to 30 places in Scotland
The result of more than five par in the third round was a 30 points drop in the final round of the European Golf Tour in Scotland.
On Saturday, Joy left the 11th position, but was found at the end of the round to be assigned 41st place.
In a difficult fight, Ilos was joined by three bogs, one double bag.
The others were hard, too.
Englishman Ian Poulter climbed to the top of the standings with a one-two-round field, although he said that holding an umbrella was enough work.
The kid was rough, but I hung in and finally had a good day, Poulter judges.
He shares his prime time with fellow countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodd.
The governor of West Virginia is changing sides.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at the Trump campaign rally that he would change sides.
"The Democrats simply rejected me", Justice said.
Today, after much prayer and thought, I can tell you that I can no longer help you as the Democratic governor.
The audience erupted in outrageous popularity.
"I'm registered as a member of the Republican Party tomorrow", Justice added.
As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game.
Trump has previously promised that a major announcement will be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining business and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that the resignation of Gov. Justic is another blow to the Democratic Party, which prefers to build barriers to a better America.
The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. Justice's announcement is the latest blow to a party that lacks any leadership and is unable to find a positive, people-connecting message, RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Salams have sown the damage coming from Thursday even the hottest day of summer
More eggs will be sent to southern Finland by the end of the week.
In the past week, the country has been particularly affected in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Warsaw-Sweden region.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, the salamanca fires started several fires.
The weather forecaster says Thursday could be the warmest day of the summer so far.
The Ucranian herds have finally found Finland.
During the past week, there has been a significant amount of lightning, particularly in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Warsaw-Sweden region.
At the table, lightning struck the power plant of the row house, causing a small fire.
The fire department received a report of a fire at about midnight on Wednesday.
The power plant was located in a sauna at the end of the row house.
Rescue teams tore down the roof and walls to find fire extinguishers and put out the fire by accident.
In all, 11 apartments were left without power, but personal damage was avoided.
And in the wild, lightning lit up the outer building in the greenhouse before midnight.
When the rescue team arrived, the building was already in full fire phase, and the rescue team could only prevent the fire from spreading.
A building about 50 square meters in size burned to the ground.
And in the Red Square, just before the statue, a lightning strike struck his home.
The residents of the house were outside the building, witnessing a glaring salamander.
Rescue personnel came to the scene to investigate the incident, but this time the lightning did not ignite the fire, only a few blisters.
In traffic, the stump caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjo and Vaasa when a traffic jam damaged the traffic control system.
The information about the error was received between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until shortly before 5:00 p.m.
Since then, the train has been able to continue normally on the runway.
The Salamis have spread destruction all over Finland.
However, the decline has been relatively low this summer.
These summer weather events have been a total mess! says weatherman Jari Tuovinen, a weather officer with the Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday and Thursday's bushfires have been mostly moderate in intensity, but the summer's low salamanders make it even more intense for many.
This may sound like a very tough one, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the earthquakes were 1,700 times, and Thursday has the potential for the hottest day of the summer: By about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 earthquakes.
If the blackout continues into the first half, we can reach more than 2,000 salads, says Tuovinen.
The previous record-breaking year was in 2015, when the year's record was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's number had risen to 18,386.
The Commission has therefore to make sure that this year does not break the two-year 'record'.
But the Ukkoskirk can wait to continue.
According to the importer, the air above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the weekend, which is a welcoming birth environment for the chicks.
The main weight of the herds moves to Saturdays from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 salmon days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
A more uniform alignment is promised in the center of the earth.
In a place like this, the Tuovisen say, you're only gonna get a few.
Coe welcomes the Russian "willful" apology for the doping scandal
World sports champion Sebastian Coe praised his candid apology for the Russian doping scandal on Thursday, but added that it was not yet time to end the Russian ban on participation.
Russian sports director Dmitry Shlyahtin told the IAAF Congress on Thursday, the eve of the World Cup, that Russia's ban was appropriate and that he intended to fight doping with determination.
He said he was sorry for all the athletes who were stripped of their gold or silver medals.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban. Russia was banned from general sporting events in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct, it was a very open presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
The whole Council and the Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Sports Federation admitted that the country had been going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganise its activities.
Mr Coe also said he was pleased that Russia had accepted the terms of the lifting of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban", Coe said.
We must do everything we can to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes out of a corrupt system, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete in the World Championships in Athletics starting on Friday in London with the status of neutral athletes, meeting the IAAF's strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still has many requirements to meet before its status can be restored.
The testing is still insufficient and the banned coaches are still free to work, he told reporters on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company failed to make Tom of Finland a hit
The film Tom of Finland did not achieve the success the producers had hoped for, Yle says.
To be honest, I am disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film industry might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100,000 viewers, which is about five million euros on the budget, compared to a little.
I mean, this didn't turn out to be a lottery win, but it's important now that investors get their money back.
If the movie had been a bigger hit in their home country, they'd have gotten their money.
Now we have to wait for a small piece of the foreign distribution, says Sucksdorff.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoske.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player ever to play football.
The Commission has also decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty.
The UEFA rules of the fair play were introduced in 2011 and require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million for the Brazilian deal, and Neymar's annual salary in the new team is in the tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects to Neymar's move to France.
PSG has no problem paying Neymar's colony and joining him in the Star Guard, as the company finances Qatar's oil-rich ruling family.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money to acquire players, but they must be balanced against real sources of income in order to ensure that the football business is not a loss-making business.
The rules of the fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, a Frenchman elected President of UEFA in 2007.
Formerly a football player, Platini believed that the pursuit of success by borrowing was fraudulent and that if banks or owners withdrew their support, it would lead to serious problems.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game rules shifted from the clubs' debts to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly complicated. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the fair play financial rules will run until 2018, during which the Funds may make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to resign as UEFA President in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb the unfair use of funds by the clubs.
The rules of the fair game are still in place and will be applied in the future, Andrea Traverso, the economic rules of the fair game at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a one-off fee, it can extend the amount in the accounts of his new contract for the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which means that the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of €44.4 million over the next five years.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should be able to assess the compatibility of the aid with the internal market and the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
PSG were fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial rules by increasing their income through companies associated with its owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not count the aid as an actual result.
The Commission also notes that the aid granted to PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was not compatible with the internal market.
It has also been revealed that part of Neymar's assets at PSG could be financed by the 2022 FIFA World Cup organising committee in Qatar, through payments available.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied Neymar being made a World Cup ambassador.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines.
The Commission has not yet decided whether to proceed with the transfer of Neymar.
The sources interviewed the Associated Press on the condition that their identity is not disclosed as they do not have the authority to discuss the situation at PSG.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific objective of the restructuring plan.
The financial statements for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of follow-up products and game shirts.
The Commission considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further steps to ensure that the Commission is able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that is compatible with the internal market.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make Neymar's transfer difficult, claiming it violated the economic rules of the fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state", Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also reserved to the fact that the state funds the football club's operations.
"This is a result of ownership that has completely changed the footballing environment over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
Anything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It is very difficult to comply with the economic rules of the fair game, because there are so many interests involved in having a famous player represent the state.
It's time to get back to work.
The long-distance runner Arttu Pajulahdi and the three-time champion Kristina Mäkela, coach of Suren Ghazaryan, are trapped in Helsinki, even though she should be coaching at the World Championships in London.
Kristina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach's advice.
The Bay of Pigs will compete tomorrow in the long jump and the White on Saturday in the triple jump.
However, the coach of the duo, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been granted a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this at the British embassy without success.
The coach has a letter from the World Cup organizers, but it's not enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptom of Brexit or what, said head coach Jorma Kemppainen.
He's always been successful in handling visa issues himself, but now there's a problem.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Union SUL for years.
It's not that important.
As long as someone looks at the steps at the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti told her coach about the possibility of a remnant.
The World Cup for Finland London is a miracle
The World Cup in Public Sports will start in London today, Friday, and will run for a fair week until Sunday, August 13.
Public sports, cross country skiing and ice skating are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are able to take a passionate approach to from year to year, whether they want to succeed or not.
In the hearts of the bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other meters.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value-added event to another, where experience matures the athlete's performance to the level that an adult World Cup is truly possible.
Now, the Finnish small world team has no such young athletes, and certainly not in the competition.
The Finnish World Cup is a miracle.
Fortunately, the excitement and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the edge of the television screen and glue them to the games, even though London's medals are not settled until late at night due to time differences.
In the previous World Cup in Public Sports 2015, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear thrower, the Longbow.
The swimmers are still expecting Longknuckle to win a medal, although the other is his recent results and those of his fellow pitchers, and Longknuckle's runner-up finish at last summer's high-stakes games.
Whatever he did in these games, Longkage will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, entering the final or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
The hope and belief in the realistic pursuit of medals in Finnish general sport for years to come will give good success in the international youth competitions this summer.
The development of young talent and the financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but it takes years of hard work from athletes and patience from both coaches and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope the London race will go down in history as the race of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not just because of terrorism or poor country attacks.
"Lake of the Roses" second in the Copper Big Air, "But it's sad"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has been ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second place is Lake Rukia's best finish at the Big Air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
The Lake of the Woods scored 147 points in the contest.
He tried his last jump at the 1080 horse for the first time in the games, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and I'm feeling good now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go well.
I'm gonna try it again in the games from now on, bitch, Lake of the Woods.
In a big air snowboarding competition, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the species.
The new Viking Line fast boat is docked in Helsinki
The Viking's new fast ship, the FSTR, is very late for the scheduled service.
The small ship was scheduled to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6.
We had eight countries on board.
The ship arrived in Helsinki too late.
I've been waiting for you to get on the ship for at least an hour and a half.
Now the train is moving a little, said Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting for a boat to board in the port of Helsinki, at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought the new ship had a technical malfunction.
Rebane said the supply company had brought water bottles waiting in their cars to access the ship.
The Viking communications chief, Christa Grönlund, tells IS that the incident was a technical fault.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be a few hours late on the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was scheduled to leave Tallinn and return to Helsinki at 8.15pm.
A 42-meter special transport disrupts traffic on the Sixth Avenue on Thursday night.
A 42-meter-long special transportation will be moving from Muukou to the port of Mustola on Thursday night.
The 9:00 transportation should be there by 11:00.
Police are controlling traffic on Sixth Avenue, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
At dawn, transportation will continue along route 13 to the port of Mustola.
The nostalgia of the little circle: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective .
The story simultaneously hints at both the characters' glory days of the '80s and the '90s grunge (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made the stunning The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time in 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it's both a parody and a description of the continuing memory we've become stuck with in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's out of date.
First Day of Camp performed surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it was reported, among other things, as a backstory for a vegetable bar with H. Jon Benjamin speaking).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors play the aspiring teenagers who are coming of age, and the emphasis on that makes it a joke to say that we can't go back.
Ten Years Later, which stars adults as adults, is less emotionally charged and more fragmented, parodying, for example, the 1990s stalker-like films such as the horror film Hand that Feeds.
In one scene, one of the characters digs up the Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and a different 1991 shit.
A lot of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but he still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as his partner in crime George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in a series like this, the best ones are the side columns.
It's really fun to see a young man named Paul Rudd wearing a shave under his lip, Matt Dillon's soul patch from Singles, and Andy, the camp boy, playing Ruddi, is getting old.
The moments of random madness may lift this series to a kind of recurring Seven Up! until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer  Twenty Years Later.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, draws on a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW series, where east meets west.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy-drama is a 1980s Romanian police drama about a Bucharest cop couple fighting for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters are Gregor and Josephine, played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who are dubbed into English by Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a great idea.
But that's not much more than that.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (police spend time watching chess on television the same way Americans watch football).
And with a bunch of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, they're making a fun game out of their bondage.
Comrade Detective, however, gets too caught up in the impersonation of a dirty socialist drama, and there's a killer behind the Reagan scandal, for example, which is why the series often starts to feel like dirty propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series isn't fast enough, and it's not rich enough.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, even when Gregor and Joseph frequent the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating hamburgers.
The message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were just smashing our own nearby history and theirs.
Toni Tauru of Kouvo will be taking part in the round of 16 in Macau on Saturday to face a former UFC champion.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game going.
Toni Tauru is getting a hard-on in Macau, because last year, Leandro Issa from Brazil took the UFC.
The Brazilian also has a black belt in track and field and a world championship.
For once, I'm going to fight myself against a parent.
It's funny, Tauru, 32, tells me.
The Kouvoalaine was supposed to go to the circle in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical issues, but three matches were moved to the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau on an early schedule.
Taurus has never encountered this before.
This was the first time my game was canceled.
It was annoying because it took a long time to prepare and train.
However, the contestant is pleased that the fight has been rescheduled.
The week's wait hardly affects preparation.
The move doesn't seem to be in good shape, because it won't improve in a week.
If you exercise too much right now, your condition can get worse.
In the past few battles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in the struggle.
This time it's different.
The Kubo describes his father as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive receiver.
I bet he'll come on hard in the first round and try to get me to the carpet.
He's won the World Championships in the sprint, so he's a good runner.
The last game of the Kouvolali didn't go as planned.
Kevin Belingon of the Philippines beat Tauro hard, and the win was for the Philippines.
I've never been so good at holding up, especially when he didn't get a hit.
When I went to the ground, he hit me in the corner of the eye.
It hurt for a very long time.
New motivation
Some freelancers fight once a year, some get up in the circle more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa took the last one in September.
And last year, Taurus played three games.
We're about to have our second fight this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
I've been training for the last few years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But I've only been picking up for picking up.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the joy of doing it back.
We had a really good training session with a guy from Sweden.
Training was a great help, for on Saturdays, a Kouvo man must prepare for physical struggle.
I've been trained against opponents of the same size and practiced head-to-head combat.
I mean, being in a box is a 32-year-old's main tactic.
I need to hit it smart.
If I get a chance, I'll go and take it myself.
The sub-export must not be given free of charge, because it is the most expensive.
Macau is more attractive to Taurus, who were once adopted in China.
I hear it's Chinese Las Vegas.
I believe we have a great, great evening ahead of us.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates flat after a period of steady growth and a reduction in inflation to a halt in speculation on interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, and the bank has moved interest rates because of increasing pressure on household income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 62 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, which was even less favourable this month because of the slowdown in economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 percent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 percent, and warned that there would be further pressure on household income levels as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3 percent in the autumn.
However, the Bank said that interest rates would be needed in the coming years to contain the accelerated inflation of Brexit and that lending costs could be raised more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Commission decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that had been launched a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide more than £15 million in favourable financing to the banks through the scheme it now offers, totalling £115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: The Committee on Monetary Policy forecasts that the slow pace of GDP will continue in the coming years as household real incomes decline as consumption decreases.
The Bank reiterated that the need to tighten monetary policy to a certain extent to contain inflation and to increase market expectations.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that the possible increases are gradual and regional.
In May, the Bank forecast a growth of 1.9% for this year and 1.7% for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8 percent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The dollar's index fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and the euro's index fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates flat was taken after the expected weak growth years dampened the increased expectations of interest rates, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's recent inflationary period has given little hope of accelerating inflation and slight wage increases for the suffering households, which it said will worsen before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy could not prevent revenue from falling in the coming years, but expects wage growth to recover significantly at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products following a weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of declining private consumption.
The decision came a year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after a shocking EU referendum resulted in a drop in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall effects of the decision are likely to be visible in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the central bank, interest rates had become increasingly demanded as inflation strained household pressures.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but the Bank said it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun of its 2% target was due to a weak balance sheet.
Given the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the home loan market would appear to be intensifying as lenders are in high demand for customers and want to end the year strongly, says Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
The market is particularly favourable for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end.
The NHS is giving 10,000 people a controversial HIV drug.
The first is that the use of a drug in the public health system in England (NHS) is not a problem.
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first 3-year trial.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the court upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS could pay for PrEP even though it claims that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a new intervention, and the National AIDS Foundation described it as an important moment to tackle.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive applications for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October, and will reach full scale in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be used before sex to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Taking the medicine before sex means that there are enough medicines in your body to prevent HIV infection during sex.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before sex.
The target group includes gay, bisexual and transgender men and people with an HIV-positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants from men, women and transgender people and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England who are registered for general practitioners can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and the NHS in England signed a contract for the medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by gathering extensive clinical evidence for its targeting, administration and treatment.
This important new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing, multifaceted and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV, says Stevens.
 It is another major achievement in the more than 30 years-long struggle to solve the greatest health challenge facing humanity.
This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV, says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Foundation.
If PrEP is targeted properly to those who need it and are at risk, it can have a reversible impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
From September, those in the risk group will receive a drug, through a NHS-funded trial, that they can decide on independently without consulting a partner, which has a potent effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news.
It is now important to ensure that the trial is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group is left out says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
The PrEP trial drug has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.
The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which has been delayed for several months due to government slowdown, says Sharon Hodgson, the shadow health minister.
We have evidence that a drug can have a revolutionary effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial is launched nationwide as soon as possible so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to the situation where HIV has been successfully stopped from spreading in society.
Quality of life: the middle floor and smart decorations have made a small Earl's Court home a spacious home
The Bank of England has also been involved in the development of the Bank of England's Banking Authority.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anne-style house, and the success of the remodel tells us that Joan has not yet packed her bags and moved.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment", Joanne says.
I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment show and I noticed that the rooms were as high as my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer the same day.
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment that only got into the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and a second floor to make room for the height of the room.
I wanted space, big windows, and lots of light.
Those were my demands, he says.
He hired Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed, a design firm in Notting Hill, and Erfan was commissioned to use nearly four metres of room space to create an apartment that would be not just a repair and sale point but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle floor that could fit in.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
Steel structures are quite complex.
The houses had to be superimposed so that they would not have to be crawled.
The structures had to be adjusted to fit the height just right, both above and below.
Erfa was able to place two full-sized rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the second floor, a retrovision copper window opens into a stylish living room.
Mirror-gold furniture, silverware and vintage Serge Mouille lights create a distinctive style.
Using mirrors brings theatrical feeling, space and light.
The mirrors on either end of the short corridor make the corridor appear longer than the real one.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window that opens the door to another room.
The mirrored furniture inside the entrance has storage space for Joan's meals and glassware.
The stylishness is added when the kitchen is hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with a doorway are not new.
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up the same way as the garage door.
It took some planning, Erfan says of the steel-reinforced cutting-edge MDF door.
 It is balanced, i.e. it slides when lifted to its place very easily.
With the proper layout and storage room, Joanne was given 16 extra squares, a second bedroom, and an even better floor plan.
When selling a house, the area decides  or the value of the property, says Erfan.
In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area.
In Joann's apartment, the area was enlarged by the use of high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
The inhabitant is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the feeling of home is partly generated by them, says Erfan.
Nobody's clinging to the wires that run through the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way.
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and additional features can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
And then you might not even want to move out of the apartment.
Princess Sofia, pregnant, radiating in her summer locks.
Princess Sophia's choice of dress was a hit.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
For the dinner of A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a henna pink dress.
Sofia was there smiling.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad, Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was representing A Sustainable Tomorrow at the seminar in a gorgeous blue bodywork dress that dressed beautifully for her last pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark community.
This is the last representative event Sofia will represent before she is born.
His due date is September.
For the event dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel dress that came down beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel dress is a beautiful princess.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden, this week.
Sofia was filling her suitcase with a little box.
Sofia was literally radiating in her lavish summer locks.
Sofia was excited about the event, even talking to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said with a laugh and pointed to her final kiss.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a house was found in the marketplace of Lahti selling Thai food.
The people of the Gulf didn't dare to taste it. They walked past.
In the barn, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Pentl, among the acquaintances of Panja.
He knew little Finnish, and the Finns at the time did not know Thai.
Because the people didn't dare to go out to eat, Panja offered free snacks.
This is how he taught the people of the Gulf to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
He said, "Staste the land".
I got stuck in the valley.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai restaurant at the Gulf Trade Centre.
It had two small tables, and I think there were fewer than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and you have limited space, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other a little bit better and became friends.
Finally, I sat by the table with a dictionary and learned Thai.
Two years passed by the mall, but then the restaurant had to move because they said the homemade spices smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was cleared at the end of the mall.
There's room.
Now we jurors can sit at our own tables again, only in the busiest times we have to ask our guests for space.
Panja knows her client.
He'll be told where he belongs, where he's been, who he's seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
She's seen the changing lives of her clients and the changing food chain.
She remembers the man I went to dinner with for my first spring break.
She remembers me as thin and fat, and she remembers how I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my own place by the kitchen door, and switch places with Panja, who's leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He's taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili pepper.
He has opened our tastes, not only our thoughts, but also our hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him, thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire him.
Even though she's had a hard time, she's always been kind.
He's a hard worker.
He's on the restaurant job in mushrooms and black.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades of hard work.
We customers had an apple pie for dessert.
Without warning or attention, this remarkable day passed, at work.
The findings of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike Europe.
The security authorities had a list of the most important anti-terrorism activities in the first year.
The list contains more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 persons in total and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of those listed are Iraqi, but six Europeans are also included.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The Evening Standard told me about the list and a couple weeks back.
Now I've got a list of locations and information that's been refined.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi Army special forces found a list of terrorist identities and photos while searching the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The fear was that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the people, but also their date of birth, their invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also includes a selection of terrorist specialties.
For example, Sami J., a 27-year-old German, is listed with the name Abu Assid al-Almani, which means German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later Turkey through Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
His picture has a special case of a suicide bomber written next to it.
There's no more accurate information about the man's fate.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe for the ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
A man was washed up on the Helsinki Tokuin beach
According to the rescue agency's interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The environment can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person was rescued from a waterlogged body on Helsinki's Tokin Beach.
Ville Estlander, a fire chief with the Helsinki Rescue Service, said the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A diver from the rescue agency found her under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue team received a call after 4:30 this afternoon.
The person was transferred to the emergency room.
Estlander says it was a man in his 50s.
The interviews showed that the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation on Tokino Beach is over.
The Estlander Group welcomes the cooperation between the authorities and the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission run by the Border Patrol.
The locals also gave excellent guidance to divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
A man was rescued from the water with the help of the Border Patrol and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in the Eurasia, nine people in the cars, three seriously injured.
A total of nine people were in the cars, the rest of them with minor injuries, says a firefighter.
The wounded are both men and women.
The accident happened at a three-way intersection at 4:00 in the afternoon.
The collision occurred when another car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says a firefighter.
According to the rescue service, the crossing area has a speed limit of 80 kilometers per hour.
The brothers are fighting over $500 million worth of real estate.
Two brothers are arguing over Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million, over a family business their Italian family founded 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, former president of Carlton Football Club and real estate developer, lives in the Tourac Value District just three blocks from his younger brother Paul.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there's a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, share 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to build wealth when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family established a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded to 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the family's agreement with the deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul's not happy with the real estate and the money.
"I think Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal", Paul wrote in his first conditional certificate for the law in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday in the Supreme Court for the first time after several mediation efforts.
The brothers are also now arguing over who's running the existing business, and Paul claims Colin shut him down.
Colin says the allegation is false, accusing Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first conditional statements that he would like to get this case resolved.
"In our Italian tradition, family is the most important thing to me", Colin said in his statement.
The costs of this case are constantly increasing, with hundreds of pages of conditional statements, emails and reports, and the case is being investigated by consulting firms like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and the best and most experienced lawyers in the country like Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up dairy and candy stores in the late 1950's.
They were used as collateral when the family bought Collingwood's property, where Colin founded the family's first fur store.
Colin explains that he started the shop in his final years of schooling when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna de Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons in a mutually beneficial way.
Luigi has often said that he does not want his brothers to go to court.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis business, and Colin says Mark made $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "broken up" about their financial situation.
Colin has kept a low profile, despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to a biography published in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutz and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin answered, and he said in his text that he couldn't comment properly on the matter because it's being handled in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and bring the family to justice", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother's demands.
'Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this,' Colin continued, adding that he still hoped that the matter would be resolved.
On Friday, hope seemed to have vanished.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future", Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president's use of the media.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First one.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit President Trump's use of the media and his surveillance of the news so that his boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
According to reporter Josh Dawsey:
When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with the executive staff on his first day of work, he addressed a key issue he intends to solve: his intention to restrict President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House staff that all information  both printed and news media  must be carried through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's use of the media and have failed.
President Trump has had a decades-long relationship with television  and as president he still watches a lot of television.
If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about the unfair news, he should have shown that the sympathetic media were more balanced, Sam Nunberg, an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri, a former campaign worker, wrote at the time that a steady stream of praise was essential to Trump's Twitter management.
- I got it.
But it's ridiculous to say that Trump's use of Twitter would have never been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't. Maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more vicious without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump left out.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems at least a few times, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has consistently been able to stop Trump from causing the storm.
Part of the problem is that there are competing groups in the White House that are trying to push their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view, which may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers are deliberately giving the president questionable information.
And then reporter Shane Goldmacher told me about this case:
Trump's current and former employees say he can get very angry at newspaper articles that criticize him  especially if they tell him about harmful leaks.
That's what happened in late February when someone sneaked a copy of a news site, GotNews.com, founded by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of multiple White House intelligence breaches.
Johnson was permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously made false accusations and later retracted them, and he had not presented any concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started the story after reading a question from staff about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter were trying to introduce a document management system for Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still running their own business.
These unchanging facts make it extremely difficult for Kelly to do her job.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French club PSG, AFP news agency reports.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who play in the Spanish football league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to join Paris-based PSG.
The transfer fee of 222 million euros is the largest in the history of football.
The previous record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros last summer for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a Qatari state-owned company.
The association is chaired by former tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
"I'm fine with my life", said bestselling author Raija Oranen, who hypnotized herself with alcoholism and flight fun.
The successful writer Raija Oranen, who was a star of the television series The Time of Roses and The Pure White Sheets, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Ray Sura.
Five grandchildren are so busy with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring, the rental apartment is gone.
In the light and sun, away from the old circles, Raijan once suffered from depression and alcoholism, from which he has recovered.
The outer self is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to drop when they stopped taking serotonin, which was a mood medicine.
I had help with alcoholism in the past with hypnosis, which was also true for flight restraints, I won it.
I've been sober for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says frankly.
Ray and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I'm better than I ever was.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in tourism, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was to be married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
She's always been the queen of that drama, ending her life with that, the Jyrki laughing at his wife.
Oranen, who has made a great writing career, remembers only the 44-episode Pure White Shorts television series that touched and moved paralyzed Finland.
I finally decided to become a member of the Raikka family's clothing business when I read Liisa Seppella's 50th anniversary interview on a plane.
I was the daughter of a juvenile, my mother also had a clothing store, and I sometimes work as a fashion model, Oranen recalls.
He said that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelaine's investigation and the claim revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen is a writer who has been working on many screenplays, hundreds of ideas.
The tourists returned across the aisle to the "millennial"
Once again, the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are in a fight with the stubborn roamers who managed to cross the city's long-lost alleyway and return to the fields next to the houses.
The tourists parked dozens of their RVs on a street called the "Millionaire's Nest" near Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city's barrier of the muddy river, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The circuit workers managed to cross the roadblock, which had been left unprotected because of the road.
Angry residents have accused Solihull municipality of being completely incapable of solving the problem.
An unnamed resident reports that the tourists arrived Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had been throwing stones at passersby.
The church must work hard because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourists were here in May, then they left, but they came back again.
More came in tonight, and probably more today.
The resident said that the city of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal taxes when the city can't do anything about it.
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the tourists returned so soon after they were expelled.
There's more of them than ever before, and they've even come down to the park to ride their horses.
According to a Solihull City spokesman, the city is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road.
In order to gather evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for the proceedings.
Angry people surrounded Portugal with a crash plane
In Portugal, the men who forced their way to a beach full of people were questioned today in court.
Two people died in a crash yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with attempted murder.
The least you can do is get 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A small manned plane was forced to crash yesterday due to a technical fault on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom were running off a landing craft into the water.
The plane crashed into a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl, who died instantly.
The plane hit the man who was behind the plane first.
Immediately afterward, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told the newspaper Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not hurt.
People on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and others went to the plane and began beating it in the back, testified Celia Rocha in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a wonder no more people died.
Two men on the plane were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star who tragically lost her leg won another World Cup gold: "Without an accident I wouldn't be world champion"
Matti the Great-Hamari celebrated the World Gold in slalom in the competition held in the Big White of Canada early Wednesday morning.
Big Ham has also won the World Cup gold in the past.
In all, I've already amassed three world titles.
It's an incredible world championship!
Two times the gold was treated, a pretty good pulse pulled, a telephone reached Big Hammer, happy.
The 30-year-old accountant thanked his coach and the very successful preparation in Finland.
Big Hamar says the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paraloon has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The gaps are getting smaller, and there's a lot of new calculators.
He always wonders if there's a black horse coming after him.
I feel like there's a different winner in every race.
Big Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been enthusiastically climbing since his youth with his friends, and the accident did not take away his desire to get to the breast.
I just think about it from time to time, and what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless to get dirty.
The cards are dealt with, and the Big Hammer presses.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and the loss of a leg as a stroke of luck, and neither does Big Ham.
But he turned the hardship into the good.
I'd say it turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Big Hamari's largest ship was already on the way.
The duck towards the summit did not really start until after the accident.
I trained with guys when I was younger, and we always beat the X-Games with a lot of enthusiasm.
But they were distant dreams that faded over time.
After the accident, I sort of found myself at the X-Games launch.
I never would have imagined it.
I was 23 years old and I was thinking, "This is gonna be a really long life if I stay here and get bitter and miserable".
I decided to pull the shark on my neck and get to work.
I'd say I've done quite well.
The calculator was very pleased that the wheelchair rider Leo-Pekka Star was chosen Athlete of the Year.
The four-time Olympian received his prize at the January Olympics.
Big Hamar says the Star's victory is an important signal for the paratroopers.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will open the eyes of the world of sports.
When is it time to launch the campaign for the two-time world champion Matty the Great's Athlete of the Year?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying my best to succeed.
Great Hamer has not yet conquered all the peaks of his lust.
Next year, set a big goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympics will be in South Korea.
We're going to get the medal!
Most Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of young Syrians do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that ending the Syrian war and leaving ISIS are the most important things that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration doesn't see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller communications network investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab women.
This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was conducted in February-March 2017 with a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24 years, half of whom were women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
The survey found that more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return permanently to their homelands in the future.
Of those surveyed, 42 percent may think they are returning home, and 4 percent were unable to say.
The study found that the decision to return home is most influenced by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor in a permanent return to their homes, while a quarter believe that the most important factor would be ISIS's departure.
Only less than a tenth of the population considers the economic recovery or the withdrawal of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors that will influence the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict
The Syrian youth were asked what is the most important factor in resolving the conflict.
The majority of the people believe that ending the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
The Fair Quarter considers Assad's presidency an obstacle to a peace deal.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Only a fair quarter believe in the solution of the conflict through merely military action.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see the weakening of ISIS's power in the past year, while a fifth see its strengthening.
The main issue in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, the respondents say, is that the media should convey to people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many took military action and education reform as their primary means.
A fair tenth of them believe that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Almost one in four people believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's presidency.
There is a split opinion on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the web in order -- the database he's developing uses Wikipedia and Google.
MariaDB, an Espoo-based company, is developing an open source database that is "the fastest growing in the world".
MariaDB, the flagship product of the company, founded by software entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users nothing at all and can be developed online by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Databases help keep vast amounts of data in order and readily available.
If you use LinkedIn, Twitter or Booking.com, for example, they're using the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from a database, and the images are linked to it", explains Widenius.
Widenius, the chief technology officer at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely with a fine diner will have his share of ensuring that the Internet is functioning smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL with Swedish author David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later, Oracle's software giant overtook Sun for 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large portion of the MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, which didn't give a sure promise about the future of MySQL", Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company at this point, which started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired Sun's top 20 developers, and I made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just needed to change the name.
A Foundation was set up to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"These verifications were not made during MySQL", Widenius regrets.
While many have heard of Widenius and the MySQL billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50 percent per year", says Kenneth Paqvalén, chief financial officer of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet profitable and Paqvalén is a minority of the company's registered office.
In this respect, it discloses that MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders in excess of EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps in database exchange, which can be a career of more than a year if the client has used a closed database.
So, you can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in a moment, because they're versions of each other.
The Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically distributed to new users in Linux distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
We're a small company, but we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central banks", Paqvalé lists.
Data markets are still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a little more of a side business than the traditional closed database.
Although the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, according to research firm Gartner, players like MariaDB remain insignificant, albeit growing, in terms of turnover.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases can't even hold up to a billion.
However, the weight of open source software cannot be measured in money alone, since most users do not pay for any of these software.
Gartner predicts that by 2018, more than 70% of their internal applications will be developed on open databases.
Moreover, more than half of the old databases would have been open by then or at least started to move.
Big companies don't get new customers because most of them go with open source.
This has led to a leap in the licensing fees for commercial databases.
Companies want to make as much money as they did with a smaller number of customers", Widenius reflects.
As the switchover of a closed database is difficult, most customer companies have obediently swallowed the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers who find it really hard to move on because their old applications and others are locked in a closed database", says Widenius.
But he still believes the customer dimension is coming to a head.
As the license fees increase each year, sooner or later the customer moves to an open source database.
The price is 10 to 20% higher than the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
And many of them are switching their database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest ever growth financing by the EIB for the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One reason for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector clients in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe is paying billions of euros a year for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently", says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how money is spent in Finland on closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to code.
The community helps and does things that it can't invent or do.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most well-known open source promoters, alongside Linus Torvalds, another Finnish Linux developer.
Widenius helps other companies develop functioning business models on open source.
I still give four or five speeches a year around the world on this topic.
Italy toughening its attitude to NGOs rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees in the Mediterranean by boat that they cannot continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules.
If NGOs do not commit to the new guidelines, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a German aid ship, Jugend Rettet, whose crew was suspected of cooperating with human traffickers in illegal immigration.
The charity, which operated for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges against Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartoso.
The rescue of human lives is and will be our priority.We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area, the organisation announced in a statement published on social media.
We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and have the capacity to assess the situation.
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet vessel Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected of taking refugees aboard the vessel directly from human traffickers who re-established the vessels.
One such case is alleged to have taken place just a few kilometers off the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor's document published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of challenging the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees the area's rescue operations, and the motivation is believed to be the desire to help.
The order of operations says that ships like the Iuventus must be equipped with an Italian police officer to monitor operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Action Guideline: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment in the Member States of the European Union (EU) was adopted by the Council on 15 June.
Among those who refuse to follow the guidelines is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti said that rescue operations have seen a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, which he said was a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors were beginning to yield results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He said he planned to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and measures with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
Suspected of killing a police officer in his open field at Enonticoke, the suspect was found in the country... case to the prosecutor.
The suspected crime took place in Enontje's Quarter last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing a 26-year-old Scottish man in the open.
I've heard before that they were both seasonal workers.
Police have also reported that the suspect, after his actions, escaped to the countryside with two dogs.
The man was found frozen in the country, and he didn't resist arrest.
The charge in this case must be dropped within a week.
The case may be heard in Lapland's district court in August.
Robert Hardy, best known for his Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone series, is dead.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by this family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also acted in films and television.
Hardy is best remembered for his role as the wizard Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and as a veterinarian in the television series My All-Hair Friends based on the book by James Herriot.
The popular BBC series was filmed in seven parts.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for texting her suicide.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for texting and making phone calls alleging that she incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving a 15-month sentence and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken", Conrad's father told a hearing Thursday.
My son was my best friend.
Carter appealed the conviction and was ordered to await his release.
He was facing a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health issues.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-colored sweater, was listening to his judgment hand in hand, crying eyes on the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Royn", the prosecutor told the court.
He decided to live Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the crime, the prosecutor continued.
He has not shown any remorse.
Carter's lawyer said the case was the result of "extreme circumstances" that Carter deeply regrets.
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's age or maturity, not even mental health problems, had a significant effect on his actions.
The DA read Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, a statement in which she said that it would not be a day that I would mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I'm coping with all this, and I'm trying my best to comfort her sister in this pain that we'll always bear.
Conrad's sister Camdy Roy told the court that she was upset by the idea of never seeing her brother's wedding and not being an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never goes away", Camdy said.
The case seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to incite suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead of a car accident in 2014 of poisoning.
The case drew national attention when it was revealed that Carter had encouraged his boyfriend to commit suicide in text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself". I don't know, there are many ways, Carter wrote in the many messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before he died.
Just before Roy's suicide Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter was trying to get attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
One of the defendants is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering a British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion piece, in which he states, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison".
NATO Secretary General: Russia's worst situation since the Cold War
The NATO military alliance and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think I can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped we could work closely with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
But Stoltenberg said NATO remained committed to preventing tensions from escalating to a peak.
As long as we are strong and predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid a further escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had noted that the relationship between the US and Russia had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump called on the Congress to thank the countries for their bad relations, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Aud announced it, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
The head of BMW said that the company believes there are even more reasonable alternatives than restrictions on driving. he referred to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 emissions targets.
The nitrogen dioxide emissions from diesel engines are thought to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission-neutral devices are increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German carmakers are under strict surveillance and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of involvement and neglect of problems by major car companies.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, and Volkswagen has installed cheating devices on cars that reduce emissions in regular testing, and emissions are higher in normal driving.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department at Aud's thermodynamics department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he could be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a Volkswagen criminal investigation, which authorities suspected had installed a system in their cars to circumvent European emissions requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The audit could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
A fraudulent investigation into the Venezuelan vote has begun, with large demonstrations authorized
According to the company, the number of voters declared by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the actual number of voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election results, National Election Board Chairman Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro assures us the crisis will end
In Venezuela, a controversial vote on Sunday elected a representative to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized protests against its change.
The opposition opposition to Maduro has postponed its own protests so that they will be in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night.
The troops are to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change is threatening the lavender of Provence
The Laventel has become a symbol of the Provence region in southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had been reduced by drought and disease-carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are desperately trying to find a solution.
Laventeli is a particularly threatened region in Provence, which has been affected by climate change in recent years, with significant declines in spring and autumn rainfall, says Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, a provincial agricultural research institute.
This will shorten the life of the valve.
In addition, the drought has brought many small mosquitoes to the area that spread microorganisms.
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly sought-after component of perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of the tall stars and the big flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or completely missing", says Chaisse.
In other words, less essential oil is present.
The solution is to increase the efficiency of irrigation, slow the evaporation of soil moisture and spray the plants with a mixture of protective smoke and water, and to develop more drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a reporter is a growing threat in Mexico.
The weekly Riodoce newsletter usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper handles the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug trafficking in Sinaloa State.
But today we're going to talk about safety because of the recent tragedy.
The staff are encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them to a facility that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the table in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking reporters for the names of each group, and they don't need any evidence, they're just going to have to have observations and feelings.
The board lists the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make the mess in Mexico life-threatening.
The violence is ongoing and journalists are increasingly the target of attacks, with at least 25 journalists murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and inspiration for Riodoce.
The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
He is deeply missed, even though he is everywhere, and the Riodoce building's poster is covered in a huge image showing Valdez with his middle finger, which reads: Justice. Thirty-something reporters Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are wearing T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face.
The meeting, held less than two months after Valdez's death, will feature reporters discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia-fueled fears.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal specifically with the cases of journalists, but according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two charges have been brought so far.
As with the thousands of murders per year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
The Riodoce reporters intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, despite their grief and the increasing danger.
Ibarra said the Security Council is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is a waste of time, to be frank", he says.
We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet taken into account the information provided by the applicant in the opening decision.
He was driving a red Toyota just a couple blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired 12 rounds, presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce, meaning "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter drove Valdez's car out of town and crashed it a few blocks away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two grown children.
The rumors move fast and they're free to roam in Culiacan.
But the death of Valdez is a bit of a shock.
Blue has been Mexico's bloodiest battlefield since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
One or more people are shot dead on the blue streets every day, and the cemetery has decorative two-story burial grounds of drug lords, larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it's peaceful when only one cartel controls ports and drug routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, founder and director of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival group that goes to war against Guzman's sons.
The incident may have angered Guzman's sons, for customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as it went on sale.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear him.
He had a long career in Norway when he decided to start Riodoce in 2003 with five colleagues, and the magazine's shares were sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem, says Bojorquez.
Over time, the magazine became known for its courageous and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Reporters appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the paper that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the history of the Mexican drug trade without feeling a second thought.
He admitted to being scared.
"I want to be able to move on with my life", she said when she won the Committee to Protect Journalists award.
Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
The reporter must accept a task that falls to him  or a foolish act.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here. Why didn't I tell you what was going on?
The staff at Riodoce need Valdez, a joker who cursed like a harbor worker, a friend who always gave them hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always wore a pan-American hat.
He went to the bar across the street from the delivery, El Guayabo, and he always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also prompted them to consider how best to do their job and survive.
Criminals don't like it when we deal with their wives and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug-trafficking backyards.
They were left out of the story, Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection,
Trusting in your own instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you should stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoc's correspondent Andres Villarreal, is that the effect can be deceptive, and that was the case with Javier.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
The cell phones were not allowed to enter the room where Riodoce's security training was being held, because a few days earlier it had been revealed that only government-owned spyware was being used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had come to the shade of a tree from a 40-degree radius.
The provincial government had assigned them to guard the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-story building in the middle class area of Culiacan.
Some journalists were half-spoiled by whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
Months had passed since journalists had visited a drug-trafficking mountain country.
This week's Riodoc's delivery included three main issues.
The great athlete Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was focused on the governor's hometown.
And one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the DA's office, was a group of kidnapped people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped or how, so caution was needed: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with drug dealers and authorities alike.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered with the name of a politician of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous cases in the same place, and in one of them, the son of El Chapo Guzman managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would have provided reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened", says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been criticized for his body structure, nicknamed El Flaco, "The Ugly".
All connections to our sources are now broken.
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse that houses banners and banners against press persecution, and the newspaper's employees have been given an unexpected new assignment: becoming activists for press freedom.
The following morning, Miriam Ramirez, a reporter, took a few signs with her as she left for a protest in front of the local prosecutor's office, which was again prompted by the murder of another reporter.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which according to DNA tests carried out by the authorities is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly across the country, with text messages appearing on pavements and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with Sinaloa's governor and accused the authorities of spying on and killing reporters because they were telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government affairs, worried that his anger will not be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that organized crime, law enforcement and indifferent society surrounded journalists in Mexico.
In his latest book, NarcoJournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they also kill them on the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Article 19 Monitoring Group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing", Ramirez says.
The murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Beside his body was a Zetas cartel-signed message: "I'm here for my writing".
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to cease operations, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a front-page message to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the reporters have fled their states or the country.
It's a tough decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on your guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals look for a reporter, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those of you who keep working, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is going to hell", he says.
A few days ago, on a Friday at midnight, when the newspaper's newest issue was finished, the reporters of Riodoce were sitting in front of the station drinking beer on the sidewalk.
In a shootout between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan beach resort, 19 people were killed.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters posted the news on Riodoc's website from the footpath on their smartphones.
I had to re-post the front page the next day.
Sirens rang nearby. Another shooting.
Bojorquez checked the delivery of the police guards:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The Riodoce editorial continued the legacy of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man pointing his middle finger at the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider quitting the paper. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked to go out on the street to do a case the same day Javier was murdered?"
The Manning Olympic Project began with a huge setback.
In April, the celebrations of Hannu Mannisen's 39th birthday were cut short as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began disastrously when Manninen contracted the flu.
This began a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
May went virtually completely ill.
First, there was the flu, and then a childhood illness like ear infection that forced me to take antibiotic shots.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I was this sick for so long.
It was a tough place to be when I didn't get the training to be used up, Manninen tells Night-Snake.
The test results failed .
The 2007 World Champion was not allowed to practice until the second week of June, as was shown by the competition and top-level sports research centre KIHU's non-roller test on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete will skate on a roller coaster, which will be increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's finger tip with a needle.
Last fall, I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I've only stayed 28 minutes.
It's a fire against the wall, Manninen says.
To the right
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he's been able to stay healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises that have tried to normalize body metabolism.
It's a really good five-week period back here.
And as a bonus, I took a week and a half off from the flight deck.
I've also had time to visit my family's cottage.
Last season, Manninen only competed in four World Cups before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen in the opening competition when Manninen climbed to 18th on the top of the skiing.
Directions drawn
Manninen and the national team's head coach Petter Kukkonen have drawn up a training and competition plan for the month of February.
We're getting a different rhythm than we did last season.
After the first round, Ruga would have a three-World Cup weekend.
In December, we're supposed to be in at least one World Cup weekend, maybe in Ramsa.
By the end of January, we're still planning to be in Seefeld.
After that, I hope the name is on the Olympic team list, says Manninen.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Mannie's sixth Winter Olympics in his career.
Now, the important thing is to stay healthy, the numeral underline celebrating the 2002 Salt Lake City Gold Team Competition.
The dinosaur was protecting itself from its enemies by masquerading as a monster .
At first, it looks like a scary scarf.
Now scientists have uncovered the first results of a study of a creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to determine that its skin was reddish brown and had a troubled past.
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best representative of its species in the world.
A recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived during the mid-lifetime of the Lunar Period, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, armored vegetable foods are the best-preserved fossil of their kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and he decided to examine his findings more closely.
The fossil found on the rock was sent to the Royal Palaeontological Museum in Tyrrell.
The beast was dug up in a 1,100-pound block for six years.
The results of hard work are now apparent.
"If you close your eyes, you can almost believe that it was asleep", says science writer Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Museum in Tyrrell.
It remains the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs in the history of science, one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs.
Studies of the leather revealed that flesh-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though they had armor and resembled a walking armored car.
Its red-and-white armor disguised it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker coloration on the surface and a more pale coloration on the underside, which is still present in many animals.
Experts say that this enabled it to blend in with its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May, and it is now on display at the Royal Palaeontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Researchers have named it Borealopella Mark Mitchell after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of the team that spent over 7,000 hours digging up the dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has survived so well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shapes of its body and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloration, with the body darker on the surface and more pale below.
The discovery was a surprise, however, because the Boreal is much larger than the animals of today with similar coloration.
It can be concluded that the flesh-eating dinosaurs preyed upon it to the extent that evolution favored hiding as a survival method rather than fighting.
Today, for example, pears, seepro, and armadillos have a similar coloration, and they are much smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was also seriously threatened.
"The hunt for a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Age of Enlightenment were", Brown says.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the nodosaurus to draw conclusions about its life, including examining its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river after dying and sank to the sea, where it sank to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was as warm then as Florida is today, and rivers and seas likely stretched farther than they do today.
This nodosaurus is very significant because its finely-cut skin has survived and it has also survived in its original form in three dimensions, Brown says.
That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early stages of the union.
It takes little imagination to see it: if you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was asleep.
The Age of the Giant was the age of the theropods, the giant two-legged, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or Borealopel, lived millions of years earlier, its mighty predecessors may have hunted this armored dinosaur.
The Tyrannosaurus Rex's predecessors included Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11 feet [11.5 m] long.
The latest findings of the Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, and they believe that Borealopela washed away in the sea after his death and mutated into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world with its skins and armor from forehead to heel.
The nodosaurs were, on average, six feet [five m] long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds [1,300 kg].
Two and a half centimeters of spike rose from their trunks.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetable-eater passed through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armour has preserved little details even in a sea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin is still left in the trench plates along its crest.
Michael Greshko even wrote in National Geographic that such a survival is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The hollow plates of its hull still contain fossil skin.
His right front leg is on his side, five feet up.
I can count the finches on the base of that foot.
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who owns the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York City the day before from his home in St. Louis and was sitting in his Airbnb apartment bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
And then he noticed a message from his high school classmate:
Police just killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street.
She was confused, and she noticed that no one else had posted the same information to her feed, so she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
During his time there were numerous re-tweets from @TheePharoah.
The username is a St. Louis rapper who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, a white police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone down, and when he went back to Twitter later that night, they told him that people were gathering for Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police shutdown threats and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, who carried a sign that read: "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell was following a real-time video of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another cop firing his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals".
This is not normal, Ferrell remembers.
It was not a murder we're used to and could be said to be typical.
I felt the cold colors.
I was angry and I cried.
He booked a flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 p.m. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father and decided they'd leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has been made into a documentary film, "Whose Streets?" which premiered in theaters on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to seek answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson in a flower suit with his daughter in a crown that matched it, they again had a discussion about what it was like to live in black and what conditions they had discussed countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things you believe in?"
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right".
"I couldn't help but take her with me", Ferrell told me later.
Today's events are the culmination of the past.
My daughter has a right to know and grow up to know.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organizing, but he also needs to know the different levels and conditions of the experience of living as a black person, and he needs to know what we need to do to free ourselves, to free ourselves.
And while I'm lucky I was able to protect her from the racial stigma, she's still just like all the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt her if I protected her from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, across from the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and finally learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local businessman who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch in bags and distributed it to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9", he says. "While attending the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Student Association of Minority Nurses, focusing on food law and health disparities in black communities.
I had no experience organizing.
Somehow it just happened.
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary, at an evening talk show.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to tell us what was going on.
Ferrell was so suspicious, he asked, "Do you really want to tell us what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times that people, usually white, had appeared in the local community to profit from its hardship and persistence.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice", Folayan said in a recent interview.
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism among death row inmates.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other local residents, and the film crew followed the events of the Brown shooting in the years following the shooting.
"This is not a document where someone is talking to us or speaking for us, but we are talking", Davis says.
What was most important to me was how the locals were portrayed in the film because I was portrayed in the same way.
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because they wanted to show that the popular movement was not about a charismatic leader but about the community.
So the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I felt quite naked", Ferrell laughs as he tells me what it was like to see the movie for the first time.
But I realized that this job and the human portrayal of black people requires a certain vulnerability.
And the Ferrell story again, and it brings back the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify as queer.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going", says Ferrell. "It's because we're constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to put up with everything.
Folayan agrees: The movement is indeed supported by black women, many of whom are queer.
However, he stresses that Ferrelli was not selected for the documentary for its "purpose" due to his queer identity.
He got the energy going, Folayan says.
But it's no coincidence that she was on the front lines, because black queer women live at the cutting edge of a lot of things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the white cloud.
The new camera teams have been leaving Ferguson for a long time, but the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell has two and a half years left on parole, and he was sentenced to life in prison for blocking highways during a protest.
His description of his home's socio-political climate is brief and central: Sekasotku.
Yet he still relies on the catchphrase he learned from outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
We have a duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains.
The perfect match: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning 's DNA
In the center of the exhibition space, the Fridman Gallery in New York City has faces hanging  white, black, and brown, which can be seen more closely.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from the cheeks and hair of Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the samples from Fort Leavenworth, where he served his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic communications to the WikiLeaks website.
The Dewey-Hagborg A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It's based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, a combination of technology, computer science and art, and Manning is a transnational and career-changing dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third and final day of his term.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 images based on his genetic data, which are sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, positions on the modification of DNA data, the multi-interpretation, and the underlying causes and identities of interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, whose birth name is Bradley Edward, has openly admitted to being identified with women since childhood, and was convicted in 2013 of 20 felonies including espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a crispy, black and white selfie of Manning, a distraught man, sitting in the driver's seat in a car with a platinum-white wig on his head that became his trademark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a hugely popular project called Stranger Visions in 2015 and it was completed in 2012.
And in it, he created images based on the criminal records, he got DNA data from cigarette butts and cigarette butts, and he created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were interviewing Chelsea Manning and they needed a picture of their story", Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference about the new exhibition.
Manning's house was not open and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in taking a DNA photograph of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even worked together on the comic book Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted a future where the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and she would have been able to see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven years in a civilian military prison.
It's also impressive that the exhibition opens right now as Donald Trump goes to war with his own informants and transgender soldiers and invents new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful double standards he was supposed to ease.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that the "screw" has a purpose.
The wall of the gallery is a statement by the artist and underneath it a large Manning inscription with the heart as the point of the family name i. In his statement the artist demands an end to the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G, and A letters written in lead.
This 200 letter  or nucleotide, as the artist's scientific definition of it is a combination of  and Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least biologically.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people understand that we are genetically equal and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation", says Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells countless stories, and here are 30 of them.
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room, a page from the Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
That's Manning's character rising from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
If they shut you up, they've won, the picture says.
♪ Never shut up ♪
The text is from a letter I received from Manning, a Philadelphia-based artist.
It's so impressive, I still get the cold colors.
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition, and when Manning arrives, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic information, like a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It's purposeful, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA section is written in a lead-lined height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a sense of community to them", says Dewey-Hagborg.
I wanted to capture the mass movement that Chelsea was born into, and that was behind her release.
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are wanted for murder.
Police say they've launched a national search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, who are suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea, and the warrants were issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of parole.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local report from the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building and found the victim with multiple stab wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president for public affairs at the university, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the authorities, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation", Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
The statement, sent by email to a University and Somerville College spokesman, states that we have been in contact with police in the UK and are ready to assist the US authorities investigating the case in any way possible.
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped he would surrender.
Chicago Police Department Chief of Information Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have a sense of where they are and we are constantly looking for them", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping with the search for the suspects.
He said the police received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had received vague information that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the sighting at the scene as horrific.
According to Guglielmo, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been inside the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair", Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board issued the following notice to residents: Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.
A man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic", the condemned told police.
Moffatt is required to complete 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated assault.
Police said the bookstore staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "ordered to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims".
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police for a threat.
The threat was not related to any book-selling events.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told police in interviews.
The penalty for the offence is 100 hours of unpaid social work and payment of £620 (about €690) in legal costs and £85 (about €95) in compensation to the victims.
According to a spokesman for Scotland Yard, a number of hate crimes are being left unreported.
We will conclude the activities under the WADA roadmap in the near future   Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA roadmap to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA.
 Some of the measures under the roadmap have already been implemented and RUSADA has been granted the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD.
WADA's roadmap has been updated on this, but Mr. Ko said Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which sets out the conditions for the restoration of RUSADA's powers.
Butko says it contains nothing to worry about for Russia.
Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future, Butko added.
However, one of the points on the roadmap requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly approve the results of the investigation by WADA's mandator, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged role of the State in Russian sport doping.
But he said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no governmental programmes, and we cannot accept those that did not exist.
The Commission's comments were based on the comments made by Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Agency of Russia.
Smirnov, speaking to the Russian sports media RSport earlier that day, acknowledged that there were problems with the Russian anti-doping body.
We will not accept the report unconditionally, but he added.
The Commission has also taken the view that the measures provided for in this Regulation are in line with the objectives of the European Anti-Doping Agency (EAD).
However, it was granted permission to plan and coordinate the test under the supervision of international experts and UKAD in June.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July and after the visit stated that the organisation was on the right track towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: 'There is no evidence' of the health benefits of maternal packaging
The British organisation has doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
The BBC and the Guardian, for example, report that the Lullaby Trust, an organisation fighting undercover deaths, has banned the use of its own presentations in maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of concealed death.
A hand-death means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK's leading health authority in the field of safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow our official presentations to be packaged in them because it would give the impression that we recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trustin, a good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, including the low number of teenage infections.
The fact that every family there gets a box may be a factor.
But you can't say for sure, said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as a product that reduces infant mortality and concealment.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The packaging contains a variety of items, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the packaging.
The packaging itself is a box of paper to put the child to sleep in.
The Scottish Government has stated that the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, for its part, says there is no standard of safety for a barbecue.
According to the Lullaby Trust, a packaging may be the best option for sleeping if no bed or mattress is available.
The organization recommends that the pack be used only for day puppies and that the use be discontinued when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of packaging and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
The fox fled the Japanese zoo for the second time
The staff at the Japanese Zoo is looking for a runaway turtle farmer.
The giant tortoise has surprised the crew with its speed and has already escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, said Yosimi Yamane, a zoo worker.
The 35-year-old fugitive is female, weighing 55 pounds and about a meter tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the off-season, the frog is allowed to roam the area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of the turtle.
The last time the company ran away was two weeks ago.
Yamane found the fugitive walking down a road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I pulled up my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your company avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online retail startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious.
"The surveys were simply not consistent or objective", Errett says. "Her hair care company, Madison Reed, focuses on e-commerce.
Errett decided to seek outside help.
There are more and more new types of HR start-ups that help other companies figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct surveys and target specific teams and groups of people, and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees, and in some cases, direct contact with the board through senior management.
You can monitor your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit? asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint, a Redwood City startup.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he's gained a deeper understanding of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The programme allows for quick surveys and votes on specific teams, and it can also draw up a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfied employees and which managers have received the lowest ratings, allowing Errett to dig deep into the problems.
Companies have realized that they need to follow the workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, and the transportation industry has been in a state of shock ever since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are bullied and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry, which, according to Lets Talk Payments, could be worth over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps businesses detect and prevent illegal behavior, grew its interest earlier this year when Uber's reputation collapsed.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables businesses to conduct customized surveys, confidentially collect real-time responses and map problem areas.
In addition, employees may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if the CEO has reason to doubt the incompetence, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
The public opinion has dismissed the authorities says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He reminds that if a company mistreats or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene, consumers may boycott the company, it may lose employees and face legal challenges.
Ruby Tuesday has over 25,000 employees in 500 offices and has been using Convercence for over a year, as it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily connect to its headquarters.
In the past, it was customary for a worker to report a problem by first finding a telephone number or an e-mail address to report it to the headquarters, then lodging a formal complaint and hoping that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a scary and unpleasant experience says Ruby Tuesday's law clerk, James Vitrano.
Problems that were previously hidden from leaders in another city or state, such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair wages, can now be detected and addressed more quickly.
I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the worker says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment lawsuits.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the failure of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical activities in the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent their trash from being disclosed to the public.
Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control, says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which a regular fee is charged.
It's a business model and opportunity that investors accept, and both Glinth and Convercent have investors who support them.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding last February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and it has raised a total of $47 million.
Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
The investment is not surprising given the links between business, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In a competitive market like Hidalgo, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a truly beneficial business.
Employees are more committed to the success of a company if they enjoy it and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding, says Nina McQueen, LinkedIn's CEO of employee rewards and wellbeing.
Investors make a profit when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder they're of interest to investors.
Workplace culture experts say it is important to know about employee engagement,
But it is useless if measures are not taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be ready for 4,000 discussions says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
If the company does not take action, employees begin to wonder whether they were heard
And whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?
Errett said Madison Reed now does a monthly staff interview and is able to get into trouble the same day it's reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated employees about the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve staff sustainability in a long-term industry known for its high employee diversity.
If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose its employees, says Vitrano.
If it loses employees, it loses customers.
And without customers, there are no businesses.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of snooping on his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from a shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a window.
The woman said the cell phone camera was taking pictures of the apartment.
The woman, terrified of the incident, had run to the other room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check on the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but then lowered back into the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of interception has admitted to taking a picture of a woman.
But he said he only photographed her face.
The video was deleted and the police had not been able to return it as evidence.
In the interrogations, the man has admitted to the crime but denied any involvement.
The man had reasoned to describe his love for his neighbor as "very crazy".
According to the TT news agency, the man is being charged in connection with the case.
Teachers are demanding more fees in the fall negotiations
The wage growth cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the gap should be reduced, said OAJ President Olli Lukkinen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday funds highlights the difference, he points out.
We cannot conclude agreements without any reduction in holiday allowances.
The municipal sector contracts are only created after the private sector papers have been signed and interest rates have been determined.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, the OAJ's working conditions will be agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been released by the Locker.
Luukkainen is also the President of the Juko, a public sector consultative organisation for trained people.
The number of people who are not able to pay their wages
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is weakening while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
Luukkain said that the temporary reduction in holiday allowances would further exacerbate the gap in earnings.
In Finland, the number of pupils per teacher must be determined.
The OAJ also points out that equality of basic education must be ensured, as the gap between the best and the worst performers grows steadily.
The organization says that learning outcomes are weakening and that the gap between students and regions is continually increasing.
The Bruins' day was longer when the NCAA cut daily practice from two to one.
It's almost 11:00 p.m. and a bunch of UCLA football players have been sitting on the other side of campus' new practice fields talking.
Some of them have their game shirts off, their backs glowing with their fur after the first day of training camp.
For a lot of them, this few minutes of chat is a midday break.
In the summer college, players return to their dorm after three hours of practice to take their final exams, and the next morning they meet at 7:30 a.m. at Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys", Bruins coach Jim Mora says just before Monday's change to Tuesday.
The university sports coverage organisation reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one, with the aim of easing the workload of the players, but has extended their days  until at least Friday, when the final tests are held.
So the first three UCLA drills started at 7:15 p.m. and it was hard to find a place for the players, who were already on a busy schedule.
This year's camp began almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Moran has held the training sessions at Westwood over the course of six years, when they are held at the same time as summer classes.
The drills are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparations for the season opener will begin: UCLA against Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA's rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We're putting a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging", Mora says.
But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, so we'll have more time.
UCLA is closing its training camp outside of camp, which is not easy, given the direct view from the training area to the parking lot next door and the Luskin Center, a state-of-the-art hotel that's already been bombed with football flying over the safety net behind the ramp.
The Bruins are set to move into the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
We have security arrangements, Mora says.
The concern is that people can book a room and record the drills on video.
The video of the drills is a pretty big one.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not gonna bother with this too much.
We have a plan.
Freedom for Rwanda
In central Africa, Rwanda, a presidential election is scheduled for Friday, with the winner already being announced.
Paul Kagame is officially running for a third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Mr Kagame has been criticised for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of expression.
He has also been accused of falsifying poverty statistics.
For a third term, Kagame is eligible because the constitution, which limits his presidency to two terms, was amended.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
Moreover, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to question whether a liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African countries.
Yet, Kagameki has promised his people more freedom after the land is raised.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting fake news by increasing fact-checking
Facebook plans to send out potential fake news to independent fact-checkers more and more often and present the results under the original article, the world's largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website saying it would start using updated machine learning to identify fake news, sending any fake news to fact-checkers and possibly publishing the results under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the biggest distributor of fake news, and many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September election, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement in Germany that fact-checking was being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass the mark of independent reviewers, and they want more background information so they can decide more clearly what they read and share", Facebook's product manager Sara Su wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook is continuing to test the functionality of the articles and is making other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
Little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for its Squeeze music video and as a hiding place for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But with 700 years of stormy history behind it, this charming castle in the Bewley River Valley is now the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mock-haired writer who loves old documents.
"I am delighted to be able to study a text written by a man who died over 300 years ago", Rhodes says, sobbing.
I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Mens Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by the British National Library's documents.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed the fingerprints in the letter, written by a double agent working for the distribution company in the 18th century", Rhodes says.
It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because that's when fire was used as a light.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archives!
The writer, who was fascinated by the old documents, was given nearly four months at the castle with the help of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian 'newness' of the castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as the hyenas hanging on the walls and the bottles that had been in the basement for centuries.
He toured the ruins and grounds of the old castle, discussing with the forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who illustrated books.
In the evening, he drank whiskey and started writing.
The nearest history of Scotney is unknown, as the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust until the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussain, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff were just beginning to search the archives, and Rhodes describes how they had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking all the excesses to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, and maps showing who owned anything. "You could imagine that the landmarks are boring", says Rhodes. "However, families here fought for even one stake.
I thought maybe we should just let it go.
Some of the stories in the book move from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, which tells of a man who, soon after the castle was completed, becomes a peasant dog in England in 1381.
Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex reports that the castle was in a state of turmoil in 1380, Rhodes reports.
The English peasant mob started in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start in a noisy way.
Perhaps these events are connected?
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle  such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family in Scotney, and the men of the family seem to have been quite the money-winners, constantly in debt and buying things they could not afford.
The Darrell men solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who could smooth out the heirs.
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experience.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Lifestone, a early 20th-century healer's farm that is now only a distilled estate.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave", she says.
I never wanted to go back to this evil place.
You're the worst thing that's happened to Russia since the Cold War.
The NATO military alliance and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think I can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped we could work closely with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the region of eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
But Stoltenberg said NATO remained committed to preventing tensions from escalating to a peak.
As long as we are strong and predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid a further escalation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump had noted that the relationship between the US and Russia had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump called on the Congress to thank the countries for their bad relations, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko to end the fight against Anthony Joshua.
The longtime heavyweight champion of the world, Vladimir Klitschko, is ending his career.
The Ukrainian Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who won gold at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, won 69 of 64 events as a pro.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost his last two career games.
Tyson Fury beat him to a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost in a violent match in the 11th inning.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But the Klitschko didn't find the motivation to fight.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making the decision to get enough distance from Wembley, Klitschko said in his statement.
I've achieved everything I've ever dreamed of as an amateur and professional athlete, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I never imagined I'd have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
Watch the reasoning behind Klitschko's decision on video.
The Klitschko's manager, Bernd Bönte, said in a press release that the decision to close was difficult for Klitschko.
But she's always stressed that she wants to quit if she's no longer motivated enough.
That's why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettieren since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
Between 2008 and 2012, the brothers held the world championship titles of different associations at the same time.
Finnish weatherman witches the conditions: "Water from the wire"
Seventh-seeded Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer offseason.
Minna Nickas has had some problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken her from the filament.
The world cup in London is also a volatile situation.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
The situation has been very difficult this summer against the seventh-seeded Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't get even the smallest of the seams to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here I know how many times and I've never experienced such a fluctuating wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This period has been very difficult to stabilize the jump, with such unstable winds in practice, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
It was a little cold in London on Thursday.
It's been a challenging time to get the technology together, whether it's a freeze-up or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been taking off the wire.
It doesn't make sense to use energy under the worst of circumstances.
He got his 455th hole-in-one to the World Cup.
There's been 445 outside.
It's not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be calm and expect better winds.
The goal is to cross the finish line on Friday at 460.
Why don't you just go and train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I got a jump on the heap and I got the tech stabilized.
I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, you've been in the gym, but now the gym is closed.
How would it be to race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little wind will blow as long as it's stable.
An experienced former official bullied politicians at Yale, saying, "We have no distribution now and for many years".
Despite the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipilä must remain calm and beware of the debt-ladenness of the state budget, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no distribution.
Yle interviewed a retired woman from Virtas on Wednesday in the village of Ykkösam.
The state budget for next year is just beginning to be drafted.
Recently, politicians have raised controversial proposals, including a pension increase, a lower car tax and support for electric bicycles.
They are basically telling us that the elections are coming up because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no distribution now and for many years to come.
I even think it's cheating to talk about the distribution of wealth when you take out a loan, Virtanen told Yelle.
Virtanen stressed that all the debt is owed to the children.
Virtas has a long history of preparing state budgets: he started as budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance in 1978 and then worked as assistant head of the Budget Office and head of the budget.
He was the head of the office of the Ministry of Labour and Economic Affairs until his retirement.
Virtanen pointed out in Yle's interview that the current forecast of 3% growth is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a peak from which we will go to the bottom of the bottom line next year, and Finland expects to grow by one percent in decades.
Washington is changing the rules on permanent residence permits .
President Donald Trump announced in the media that the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, will be changed by the new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is due to be debated in both houses of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayer money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces the chain of exchange and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and who have the skills that will benefit our economy, Trump said, according to media reports.
The husband of the Danish queen does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
This is a picture of Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried next door, the Danish court said.
Traditionally, the two rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal Household has today announced that Prince Henry will not be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the Prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court's communications director, Lene Belleby, commented in the paper.
The prince's decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal to his spouse.
The Queen has long been aware of her husband's wishes for a burial place and understands the decision.
A moment of fear on the road: A car had to come over the highway
Tom had a step-sister and two young children on board.
They're not injured in the accident, but they can't get insurance money if the other party isn't reached.
The accident happened at the Keimolaport on Vanta.
Archival footage from the construction site of the Third Circle.
The defendant, Tommi, says his family survived a car accident Tuesday by selling miracles.
Tommi, his opening act Riina, and the couple's two young children were driving on the highway near Keimolanport, Vantaa, toward Hämeenlinna.
From the junction of Circle III to the Camino de la Pompidou, a white car was driving along the accelerator, which was to drive the family car to the side, Tommi says.
Without the traffic, Tom would have been in the car.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of my hands, Tommi says.
The family car hit the curb at high speed.
The parents and the two little children in the back seat were not hurt.
One of the children is a little under three years old, and the other is under one year old.
I guess we were lucky enough to be safe.
No one was driving past us, even though there was a lot of traffic.
The accident happened around 5:20 p.m.
Tom said no one stopped by and the family called the emergency room.
They got out of the car on their own.
The ambulance and rescue personnel arrived, and the family was checked.
The car went into recovery mode.
Tom says he and his ex-wife have low income and they got a family subsidy to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, Tom says the family won't get insurance money.
That's why the family is asking witnesses to observe the car that drove the family to the intersection.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to the barn and go to work without it, says Tommi.
Tom saw that the car was white, an old car.
It was probably late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thinks the first number on the car was the SIG.
If the culprit doesn't get caught, I don't know how we're gonna make it financially, we're still gonna have to count every cent today.
Tom hopes that those who saw or know something about what happened will contact the police.
The Eastern New Zealand Police and the Central New Zealand Rescue Service confirm that they were on duty at the scene of the accident on Tuesday night.
Headline and case corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what the case originally said, Tom said that the other car did not come to the intersection, but was to drive from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
The show, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relationships through the medium of humor.
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvo brings her first directorial work to the What? Theatre.
Self-disclosure is a musical theater show about the mismatch of past relationships and inadequacies.
Director Lotta Jappisen says it's still going to be a good mood.
The subject is treated with humor.
He says that sad feelings don't get in the way.
According to Jäppisen, the tour is a small budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the show challenges us to reflect on what a person reveals about himself as he gets to know the new person.
Is he pulling a roll or is he coming to open the other jacket?
A plotless performance blends fact and fiction
The asshole has both directed and dramatized the show.
He's also answering the lights.
The presentation is composed of the texts of the working group and does not contain a plot.
The director believes that while the show is a breath of fresh air for young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
The man who was a self-proclaimed author emphasizes that the self-proclaimed author does not directly tell us about his own or his workforce's relationships.
It's a mix of fact and fiction.
I'm sure my own world will care about the show.
I don't think human relationships are bad, but I also don't think that human relationships, especially couples, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Detectator draws a timely picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
He says that many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show stars Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
The music is a combination of Jacky and Roca.
Love for the theater was kindled in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvo, is studying to be a theatre performance director at the Turku Vocational High School of Arts.
Two years behind and another asshole in front.
The asshole's enthusiasm for theater has been building since the Kouvola years.
She has been a musical teacher at the Kouvola Theatre, and has performed at the Ylioppilast Theater in Helsinki and most recently at the Linneteater in Turku.
I'm starting to get more and more interested in directing.
The self-defense was first performed last week in Helsinki at the Narrin stage.
A 45-minute performance will also be seen in the future, at least in the town of Jappisen in the market.
Self-disclosure at the Kouvola What? at 4.8pm and 5.8pm, 2pm and 7pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a year of terrible motorcycle accident
Few athletes in Finland have the unstoppable natural strength of Janne Lahtela.
A companion ace traveled the world hundreds of days a year for 20 years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtila movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainer, but also a new species experimenter.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It's been a real thrill to practice.
There's always something new, says Lahtela.
One hobby was to stop Lahtila completely.
In 2014, Lahta was involved in a motorcycle accident.
As a result, his collarbone and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I've been in my house for a year, says Lahtela.
I had bad luck with milk.
He also admits that age may have been a factor in his downfall.
Driving on the brakes can sound crazy.
But I didn't ask for the limits.
It's just so hard as a species, it's not worth it for a 40-year-old like this to get too involved!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a very special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He had a long, long back as head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started his career in the playoffs right after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my place.
I didn't really do anything, Lahtela says.
During his training, Lahtela often challenged his protege in breast and physical tests.
Surprisingly, the stop was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my thoughts didn't even make sense.
Not even in the species.
It's good to be back.
I actually enjoyed it because I was only allowed to be there once.
The mandatory break has made Lahtala the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he's burned to the ground.
It's easier to find places on your body that have been broken than intact ones!
If it hadn't been for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started coaching the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby than speed skating.
I traded the motocross for the frisbee golf!
It just went off the rails.
At my worst, I was throwing for seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer, he does not demand that his subjects be like him.
I'm not gonna make everyone dress the same.
Our culture of species has room to be one of a kind and ways to be the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been that way, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming, and we should be worried.
It's here: a report on the technological development of sex robots  just when it was beginning to feel like 2017 couldn't get any stranger.
I'm sure you are.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
"We must start taking the proliferation of sex robots seriously", says Noel Sharkey, founder and professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nails and the type of earrings.
Sex robots are being scouted, but they are already selling quite a lot, and we will see more of them, Sharkey said at the report's release.
Sex dolls have evolved from blowing dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and artificial-intelligence features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his preferences, always from eye color to the shape of the nails and to the type and color of the fingernails.
Even more worrying is that the robots have a personality that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, even if it is a bug.
The Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have a preprogrammed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
Roxxxy Gold's personality is as fully adapted as possible to the user's personality, advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It may be tired, talkative, or in a mood.
There are many worrying features of the popularity of sex robots, which are a replacement for real human relationships, but even more dangerous are the subjugation of women and the fantasies of direct rape when the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to be a bully and resistant.
True Companion compares a Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?
But sex robots are not just fetishes or a new kind of sex game.
Their widespread and growing expression reveals something darker and deeper in our culture: a retreat from gender equality to sexual intercourse where subjugation is one alternative among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report points to their growing popularity.
But the marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people start acting strangely or offensively only after the market allows them to.
It's no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become commonplace at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and a president is sitting in the White House, boasting of harassing women.
The TV series The Handmaid's Tale is not most disturbing because of its powerful imagery, such as images of bodies hanged and eyes dug out.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
They try to make sex robots look as much like real women (at the scale of porn stars) as technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as best they can.
Their personalities, however, are far from reality.
The robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will, no history, no reference to independence, no breach of the fantasy of complete submission.
They're nice servants.
A slave, you know.
Police suspect two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, led by the head of the Islamic State group
The head of the Islamic State trade group was leading a group of Australian men who were suspected of planning to carry the bomb onto an Etihad Airways plane.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a senior figure in the ISI also sent bomb parts to Sydney.
Suspicions were that the bomb was to be flown on July 15, but the operation was stopped before a security check.
The police are not going to give us a detailed explanation as to why the operation was stopped.
The second plan of the terrorists was to build a device to emit toxic colorless gas and to carry it to a public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Federal Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist scheme was one of the most professional schemes ever undertaken in Australia.
Four men were arrested on Saturday night at police stations for suspected terrorist plots.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogation is ongoing.
The good things about Trump?
It makes Mitt Romney look like a common-sense perp.
The Trump era has been repeated to the point of being bored that the strong double-cross vote has also broken up families on a regular basis.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspaper advisory boards gave guidelines on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information community to explode.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm telling you this because my cousin grew up this week at my house in New York, and he's a left-wing poet from Chicago who has long been a vocal opponent of our Republican family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin is known to everyone, including the pro-Republican sister with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
It's a good thing to have at lunch, but more broadly, it comes with significant risks.
Trump has given a new lease on the left, but the distortion of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we're talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to scare him with his tricks anymore.
In the long run, there's an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the right-wing Republicans, who, compared to Trump, seem to suddenly make sense.
I remember, as a hawk, Mitt Romney's tempered version of insanity: dog on the roof of a car, 14 percent income tax (and we've seen his tax returns) that, compared to Trump, seem like very slight violations.
When Trump's term ends, the next Republican presidential candidate needs to be clear-headed, and it immediately feels like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting, we took our kids to the Central Park carousel, which is the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The carriage horses are huge, the characters in the middle, the mocking clowns, and the animals in fear are evil, and the screaming music behind them is strangely charming.
Over time, many of New York's landmarks have become disillusioned: the view from tall buildings becomes dull, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city becomes unrealistic.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that the Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a major transport hub in north London.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience  even to the point that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carriage full points if someone had asked me for my reviews, but thankfully no one came to ask.
Instead, this week at the department store, I was asked to rate my payment experience on a five-star scale before I put my credit card on a calculator.
Same thing at the coffee shop in my corner, but I'm also given the opportunity to add an estimate of a 15% service fee when I go out and get coffee myself.
This slows down the interaction and forces the customer service representative to put his personality in a situation where it's not needed.
The store manager smiled in regret as I tiredly gave my credit card five stars for experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter... "There was no trust in management".
FC Inter today released Shefki Kuq from his duties as head coach of the club's representative team.
The coaching responsibilities will be assumed by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously served as assistant coach.
The other training group will continue in its current role.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously worked as an assistant coach for Sunderland, England, among others.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, has completed his UEFA Pro Licence last year.
The chairman of the board of FC Inter, Stefan Håkans, regrets the incident.
Changing coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the management of the association, so there was no other option now, Håkans commented in the association's press release.
Piccaretta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
He's in charge with the rest of the coaching staff for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to the Newsletter, the team has been in a state of drought all Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the team's assistant coaches, Piccareta and John Allen, have been moved out.
Kuqi and Piccareta were strongly drawn against Inter in a match against PS Chemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a photo of a teenager in the '80s. Would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a photo of her youth on Instagram.
Several symbols have been added to the image, which gives the impression that the musician is a 16-year-old student at the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself is wondering about a young woman staring at a serious camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's communicating.
If you can't see the picture, you can watch it from here.
Lampenius has published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A year ago, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram.
One picture shows her 20 years ago, the other shows her posing now, as a mother of two.
In his illustration, Lampenius reflects on his own human growth and refers to eating disorders he suffered from as a young man.
I mean, 20 years ago, and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
He had added the following hashtags in English: Life, eating disorder, insecurity, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has been open about his past years of eating habits.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 with anorexia and orthorexia.
Later, she also developed bulimia, which was not finally discovered until 2006.
He started to heal slowly.
In addition to therapy and comparisons, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pains.
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for a slit on his wrist, which prison officials say he suffered after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors complained of an original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing multiple shots through the toilet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder hiding in the bathroom.
Prosecutors have said they plan to appeal again, considering Pistorius' six-year sentence too light.
The state prosecutor is planning to appeal to South Africa's highest court, which may be hearing the appeal as early as this year.
If the appeal is approved, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in force in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarian illegal camp workers were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said on bTV.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized camp followers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
According to the bTV television channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone camping in non-purpose areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry has announced that the court may impose a fine.
The liquid's already down by -7.7%.
Oil company Neste's share has dropped 7.7 percent by about 11:00.
Its earnings before tax declined, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started trading today on the soft side of the freezer in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock market, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH had fallen by 0,3% to 9509,48 points after trading for about half an hour and the most traded companies OMXH25 had fallen by 0,3%.
The total turnover of the exchange was EUR 41 million, of which EUR 9 million was borne by the morning financial services company Liquide.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare to the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may help relieve irritable bowel syndrome.
It is a terminal illness affecting about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan, a protein, helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the intestinal capacity.
According to study leader Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause infections are balanced by cells that strengthen the immune system, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to the infection, it can result in irritable bowel syndrome.
The tests showed that immunosuppressive cells were found in mice with certain bacteria in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to start making immune cells, which is one of the building blocks of proteins.
We found a link between the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria and the development of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan in the mice's diet, the more these immune cells they had.
If the same thing works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuterium bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can boost the tolerance of the intestines and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When studying endurance-boosting immune cells, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that even though one group of mice had such cells, they did not have the same type of cells in mice that were considered separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbiome of the intestines of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the DNA of the intestines of mice was examined, six bacteria were found in those mice that had immune cells, but not in the other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were given to mice that grew up in sterile environments without gut microbiomes and developed immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
To find out how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of non-bacterial fluid from mice to isolated, immature immune cells.
The immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen the immune system.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it was a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of cells that strengthened the resistance increased by about 50 percent; when the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Cervantes-Barragan says that humans have the same resistance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuterium bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria can cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people with irritable bowel syndrome, tryptophan-related genetic errors have been observed.
We probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate the inflammation of the intestinal surface, says Cervantes-Barragan.
High levels of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their spread.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a deal with Nemanja Matić
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have been given the opportunity to sign a deal with Nemanja Matic, who made his debut on the Manchester United roster against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40m, made his debut in a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's last pre-season game before a UEFA Super Cup tie against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
But Matic was not in his best shape yet because he wasn't on the blue-shirt Asian Tour before the start of the season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking style make him a genius. He has a natural football mindset", Mourinho says.
We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later.
In addition to Matic, the returning players Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to scramble his opening round of fixtures for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a fantastic job of acquiring three of his four priorities.
"Three out of four" should be thanked for, he added.
I'd be happier if I got all four, but they did a great job.
Airmen were attacking Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish women's national handball team lost their fourth match of the World Handball Championship to Germany by a score of 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German gambling routine is high.
Their game was level in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds Finland kept their opponents close, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we could join in, Kangasniemi said.
Finland's most effective was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Three games out of four, Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
A grand jury has already filed a lawsuit regarding Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia.
In the United States, a grand jury has sent a summons to the trial of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitska.
A grand jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already sent out a summons to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaia, a well-known Kremlin activist.
The news agency Reuters confirmed the news, confirming the Wall Street Journal's earlier Thursday report on the summons to a grand jury.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has sent a challenge to Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-backed Waterman meeting that took place in the middle of the 2016 US presidential election in June.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr.'s then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington signals a steady stream of Russian investigations.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help investigate Russian interference in the US presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his closest allies cooperated with Russia in the case.
The grand jury is expanding Mueller's powers to collect evidence, send out challenges, and force people to testify on probation.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence the prosecutor's investigation has uncovered and decides whether to press charges in the case.
A British inventor micro-scrambled himself to get into his house and car by waving his hand
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to microwire himself so that he can open the outside door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a wave of his hand.
Microsir is a 33-year-old man between the thumb and forefinger of Steven Northam, who now provides services to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consultant sleep specialist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets the medical requirements.
Microstructure uses the same technique as cat and dog microstructures, and it only takes 30 seconds to install.
Northam's also trying to make the locks on houses and cars compatible with the microchip.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he's installed microwire technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands of dollars .
The White House's final decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn of the White House for an event to showcase American production came at a cost of $24,000 to taxpayers, according to a TIME newspaper obtaining military documents.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the President is on board.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials went through the products in all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter built in Connecticut, the samples included a sailing ship from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter's location by mission order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as evidenced by the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet documents.
I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this, as this is an extraordinary event that is gaining a lot of visibility, the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an email to his commander, who is the Assistant Commandant of the Navy Aviation, the day before the event.
The report said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field at 7:00 a.m. on July 17, and that the event would begin at 3:00 p.m. and that the helicopter would not leave the area until after the grass field was cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
The message also stated that if the helicopter were to leave the White House late, another crew would be needed due to service hours.
The original crew was on the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter's side when it was on the ground.
The documents obtained by TIME magazine do not indicate whether a second crew was needed.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether the incident violated the law.
One of our questions was whether the Hatch Act was violated, and we were told that there was no violation, the commander wrote.
"It seems you can participate", replied the Deputy Commissioner.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it wasn't covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the President spoke in favor of a health care reform and a lower government regulation that was under consideration in the Senate at the time.
The use of Marine One helicopters and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels.
But it's unusual to use them for just pictures.
Trump's actions were brought to the attention of the public in February when Air Force One rolled out against the backdrop of a presidential campaign in Melbourne, Florida.
The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which presented products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states, said Lindsay Walters, White House press secretary.
The crews of HMX-1 are regularly flying training flights in the Washington area and practicing on the south lawn to bring the president to the White House with an accuracy of six inches.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 drill landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training allowance.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day in support of the presidential mission.
The White House said the incident did not cause any other costs to taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter show at the south lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have an accounting for flights related to the President's duties and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, the flight from Quantico to the White House and back from Virginia took a total of one hour.
The White House says the helicopter's operating costs are significantly lower.
The calculation of the costs to taxpayers by compensation level is misleading, says Walters.
The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission has not yet established the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was defending the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production", Spicer said.
I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employ probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopters and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked so hard to build.
It is perfectly reasonable to bring it up.
I'm not sure if Trump was in the helicopter at the time of the incident, but at least he was sitting in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump was making fun of the press about his own Sikorsky ship.
I know Sikorsky very well, the President said.

The Venezuelan prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The Venezuelan prosecutor has asked the court to rule on the appointment of a new representative.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the delegation elected in last Sunday's vote will be appointed on Friday.
The contested vote elected a representative for the country, which may amend the country's constitution, among other things.
Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the order to stop the election was requested because of allegations of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also launched an investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges after a British polling company said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million more than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the House of Representatives, and the 545 members of the elected House of Representatives included Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and amend laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new House of Representatives is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been going on for months.
They've injured countless people and killed over a hundred.
Venezuela was in a financial crisis after the oil price fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is expected to vote on Friday, when a new parliament is due to open.
Finnish Russian man sentenced to four years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, a Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senakh to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in a global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a US request.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him on his way home.
Finland surrendered to the US Senate in February 2016 despite Russian objections, AFP reports.
He was convicted in March of this year of computer fraud that had generated millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported from the country after serving his sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement accused Finland and the United States of having been arrested in Finland without the prior knowledge of Russia.
According to the prosecutor, Senah was using a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the information to further traffic on the Internet, which was used to commit click fraud and distribute junk mail.
Kenneth Blanco, deputy director of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, said the case shows that the United States has the ability to hunt down cybercriminals in other countries.
We have the ability and willingness to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in a statement.

The third season trailer for Narcos: Pablo Escobar is off the charts, so the Cali cartel is rising to the top of Netflix's hit series
Even though Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will be shown in the third and fourth seasons, and the trailer for the third season has been released, which will feature new additions to the series.
In its third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali Cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The four-person organization operates like a Fortune 500 company, except for a little more corruption and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brains, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is the head of the Mexico-based network, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is based in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers to fight the war on drugs.
The new faces are Matt Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Kari Kola is conducting an extraordinary lighting project in Paris
The renussian light artist Kari Kola (pictured) will be executing an extraordinary lighting project to celebrate the first UN Day of Light in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola is doing a lighting project for Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness, day and night, sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters, the Fontenoy Building, and the Globe monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness in my work.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make my experiences more visible", explains light artist Kari Kola in her work.
I am very welcome to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art to the theme of the day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening ceremony of the Year of Light in 2015, when she lit the light on the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-enact my art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may be extended further, in a very significant way.
We'll report on this later in the fall, Kola continues.
The International Day of Light aims to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in the centre of Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting in a shopping mall parking lot in Espoo
Two men were involved in a dispute at the Espoo shopping centre in the parking lot of the Big Omen on Wednesday morning.
The parties claim that the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove on a prohibited road.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
A driver driving on a restricted route would hit the driver of another car, causing the driver to start moving and hit the hitter's car.
After that, he hit another car that crashed into the engine.
The man has admitted in his opening statement that he caused damage and wrong.
Question mark by Timo Soin: "Afterward came the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (pictured) published a blog post on Thursday, entitled 'Question Mark'.
The writing is short, only two sentences in length.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a governing party of 37 MPs.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of the sonnet is a reference to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, are known to have used the flood equation.
Depending on the interpretation, the historical books have retained the phrases "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
The UN says Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
The elections are representative only if they are open to all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the UN's interim head of the aid mission, said hundreds of women were running for office in provincial council elections, three women were running for vice-presidents, and more than 30 percent of the recently registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized", Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
The only way that elections can be truly representative and credible is if women participate fully and are included in all aspects of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats to the elections at a time when international forces are moving into advisory roles.
This year's election marks the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the women's contribution to Afghanistan's democracy would be a great help.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering restricting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of the locals is particularly directed at the tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: only a few hours away and crowded with tourists.
Venice is stifling its rush of day trips to the city.
The cobbled streets are hard to move around, and the beautiful squares are so crowded with visitors that Veniceers can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center as hotels have replaced their homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian have written about the problems tourism brings to Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon "poor quality tourism" - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you'll be given two or three hours.
Follow the flag-bearing guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and troubled tourism of Italy's Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture but also in the functioning of places, shops and workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the city's identity.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historical center of Venice.
On the side of the square is St. Mark's Church.
The local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
In the historic center of Venice, there are only 50,000 inhabitants left.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venezuelans protested against mass tourism.
They say tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven people away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years, Venice will be a tourist destination.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the protest.
The relationship is difficult because the ships bring the much needed income to Venice and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to restricting tourism, the solution is to allow cruisers to go further than the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Venice, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - unless it were full autonomy.
Venice is visited by about 20 to 30 million tourists every year.
Are you driving towards Copiah?
On the highway, miles of traffic
The northbound highway between Kopi and Lake Siilin has been busy for miles on Thursday afternoons during return traffic.
The area is undergoing a road surface work, which slows traffic, reports Savon Sanomat.
The road speed limit is 50 km/h instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even within the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon, but in practice at walking speed.
The work was carried out on Thursday afternoon near the mouth of Lake Siilin, near the Golden Calf.
I can get along without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been exposed to public curse.
Amalie Iuel has published some amazing photos of herself in the landscapes of the Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in her native Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter run in March by running the cycle in 51.81.
A month later, he improved his 400-meter hurdles to a Norwegian record time of 55.38.
After setting a record, Iuel, an avid social media user, soon realized that fame and publicity have their own shadows.
Men around the world began sending Yuelle pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
I had to shut down my Snapchat account from outside the box.
I received a lot of "snapshots" from strangers, so I had to turn my account private, Iuel told VG.
Iuel didn't want to be specific about the kind of pictures he was getting in the VG interview.
You can guess, I'm sure.
It's nice to get feedback after the race, but I'm getting along really well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, her father is Danish-Norwegian.
I mean, I think I've always had a dream.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of her father's job.
Then it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a college athlete at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is trained under three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, we are much more open to discussion than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask for anything. They just give instructions.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete in person, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record in the 400 metres and 400 metres in the 400 metres hurdles.
A foot injury has taken snowboarder Janne Korve to a career-ending chase, now part of the World Cup: "Good when nothing hurts".
It's been a nice countdown, since nothing happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has once again enjoyed her beloved breed this season.
As early as last summer, my career was on the line.
The leg injury forced Ear to go to the operating table in January, and he had no desire to recover.
I had a hit in the race.
I didn't know what I was doing in the summer, whether the boarding was going to continue or not.
The sponsorships were cut off and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to get better.
My leg was healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood started to drain back into the breast.
It was easy to make a decision after that.
I knew it when I first went to the snow.
I was like, damn, yeah, this is so much fun, we're gonna take a couple more trips.
The corpus didn't get a proper count until September or October, but after a long countdown, just a painless workout has been a big deal.
The Corps has only been around a few games.
It's all right.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the earboard.
I've never been down for one race.
I find it frustrating to focus four years on one game, and then you're in a fever that week.
I can't think like that, Korpi says.
Today, Corpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although individual races do not keep him on the board, in a tough race he always gets burned.
Earve said that the International Ski Federation's competitions have grown in popularity in recent years, even though some boarders chose the X-Games in Norway to be held at the same time.
These are important races, and the visibility is high.
I do, however, think that the value always depends on the conditions and the level of the games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-man Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pupils, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point, when everything was new and I was so sick and excited about everything.
It'll bring a new flow to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still gonna be a little behind the breast, but I'm not, because that's how much the friends have in the stream!
In addition to her rowing career, Janne Korpi has also built a different sporting career.
The son of the legendary trainer, Pekka Korve, is addicted to raving: the racing driver has his own raving horses for whom he does training programs.
I mean, when I'm on the road all the time, it's not like I'm gonna be able to be at the fair any more.
But I look at at least the nutritional outcomes every day, and usually at some of the sources, Korpi says.
In addition, the Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new programme of action to be launched in the framework of the European Regional Development Fund.
I don't plan to go that far, but it's a likely alternative.
I feel like I'm studying it right here in the snowboard.
I'm trying to stay up to date and get better. Maybe I'll do some starting things this summer.
If that's my future profession, then it's not hard to start once you're already inside the species.
The food items also include the Elitloppet feeding tour organised by the organiser Jaajo Linnonma.
The twins have rented a cruise ship that will be heading to Stockholm for the Elitloppet food contest in late May.
Korpi and Linnaeus decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has been a great success, and people have been thrilled.
We're at the point where we're not going bankrupt.
"We have a few months left, hopefully to get the ship full", Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing assignment to Kite has surprised everyone.
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new 41-bed nursing home being built for Kite.
The 1,700-square-foot building will be completed next summer across the street from the health center.
A common question is whether there are enough customers in the new unit, as many private nursing homes are running out of customers during the Battle of the Bulge.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director for Health Services, commented that Kite will have an increased demand in the future for not only options but also for efficient service housing.
"We need all kinds of services, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better", Flink says.
Attendo bought private nursing homes from Kite last year, the Canervik School and the Erika.
The deal was business, but the real estate is known to be a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo doesn't have an acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of operations at the McVitie brand's Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the managers of McVitie's cake manufacturer of a long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish section of GMB, the UK General Trade Union, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea cakes and other products are made in a factory with more than 500 employees.
The company Pladis, which owns the McVitie brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives would certainly be the first to be re-elected if there were any changes in their activities.
In a letter to the manager, GMB urges the company to response to concerns that no funding has been provided for the modernization of production lines.
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy is very concerned that the plant manager does not provide clear information on the business needs of Tollcross and its future investment plans.
Families have worked here for generations and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area.
In view of the increasing employment, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising living costs and the continuing reduction in production, the East Glasgow region is in dire need of a successful McVities production.
According to the Pladis spokesman, the factory manager had only received the letter of the trade union the day before and the company responded directly to it, as it appreciated the continuous interaction with the workers and representatives of the trade union.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, where we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with the employees, among other things, how, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we constantly assess all our businesses and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.
According to the notifier, the company has invested over 5 million pounds in the past years in the Tollcross plant, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
We are aware of Tollcross' long history as a manufacturing facility and will be the first to inform workers and trade union representatives if we intend to make any changes to the operation of the plant.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's ambition after paying him 189 million pounds to close the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about event of the summer, with the French Ligue 1 team set to break the world record for the most transferred players, a record that was less than half lower than the previous record, set when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United on a £89m transfer.
After the move, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's highest paid professional player, as PSG offers him a weekly salary of over £500,000 after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be angry at PSG's behaviour and the way Neymar has been leaving the club.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they look up our players, we'll become their opponents and we'll contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they're attracted to our players, they'll face consequences.
Barcelona seems to have done just that: it expressed its interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances, and it is quite possible that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar because of this.

The phone calls Trump made were made up, and the White House spokesman said, "I wouldn't say it was a lie".
The White House admits that the two phone calls that U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned never took place, reports the New York Times.
Trump's smoking calls with both the president of Mexico and the head of the National Guard have proven to be fabricated.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
Sanders said many of the top officials in the patrol spoke to Trump in person, and that Trump had spoken with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie. It's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations were happening, not just on the phone, but face-to-face, Sanders argued.
The speech to the patrolmen was outrageous .
Trump said Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump for his successful crackdown on illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told the media that few will ever cross the southern border of Mexico because they know the journey will be thousands of miles to the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying that the call did not occur.
On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's when Trump lit his speech at a major National Patrol Conference in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the patrol boys, and he said it was the greatest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Patrol said it was not aware of any of its executives' calls to Trump.
According to the report, the previous statement by the organization's director, Michael Surbaugh, in which he apologized to the patrolmen for Trump's speech, speaks for itself.
Trump's speech at the National Guard meeting aroused much admiration because it was exceptionally political in the nature of the event.
Among other things, he was a sparkler for the results of last fall's presidential election.
