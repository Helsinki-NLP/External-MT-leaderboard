The members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about making a fool of themselves.
There is a feeling of consternation among some Members of the House at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose as a result of the plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that it could rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means moron and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party said he was open to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of the Yorkshire letter U.
The Assembly committee, which is currently drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of how members of the Assembly will be called will obviously be a matter of debate for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the possibility of convening the Welsh Assembly.
As regards the title of Members of the House, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option has received more support in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulty of reaching consensus could prove a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to table a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of MPs and the design of the committee system.
The MA will have the final say on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians go to the polls for referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territories and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
"The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
"There is no one today".
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently today", she explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood saloons that people regularly frequent".
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won't help the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he says, "and they will therefore hasten the time when these churches will close down altogether because it is unlikely that a large proportion of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black congregation that worshipped in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the retailers on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something different: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated web of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese was trying to pass costs on to the parish assembly, although the latter was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old man while diving for lobster in California
Official sources say that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season on Saturday.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swam to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was just excitement from catching a lobster but then he realized that the boy was shouting "I've been bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was lacerated, and he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said in a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme to boost the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with dedicated beauty aisles for the department store's specially trained assistants.
As part of a major push towards the UK's £2.8 billion beauty products market, which continues to grow while sales in the fashion and home goods sectors are falling, the largest beauty aisles will be trialled in 11 shops across the country and adopted in more shops next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for new ways to use the shelf space once devoted to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty product line to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will take up more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range to make most of the products vegan - a quality that is increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will be experimenting with licences in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, while a second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food daily from small neighbourhood stores have forced supermarkets to do more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to resist discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmacy outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the programme, with the addition of a wide range of luxury brands of skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Manager at Sainsbury's, said: 'We have transformed the look of our beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, as opposed to the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby walks away from £ 11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with her trendy label to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his Truly homeware and accessories brand anymore.
The couple's business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host took to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after pulling out of their lucrative fashion brand business at the last minute to focus on his new, exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when the TV golden girl admitted in a tense meeting at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth £1.5 million - did not leave her enough time to devote to their Truly brand of homewares and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was estimated to have doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at around £11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday residences.
According to one source, "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would keep her busy for the next 20 years.
His decision to quit left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to heavy investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity programme.
A source close to Jones said last night that he "doesn't wish to comment on his business dealings".
Harsh words and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would deem "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his voice that he imitated the "news anchor".
"I have given up nothing".
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second summit after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
The EU's position on the issue of the right to vote in elections was also welcomed by the European Parliament.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
'We are getting very good results with North Korea,' he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the repatriation of the last American servicemen.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded field, we would have about 200 people right here in front of us", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, leaving hundreds dead
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes that Indonesia is continuously subjected to, the country remains terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the warning, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is heading to Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign and poured money into roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko's administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the more conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight each other using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws against Chelsea .
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 25 yards from Chelsea's goal, with his team trailing 1-0.
He touched the left ball before he hit the second post.
The attempt passed high above the door frame as it turned towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell on Kepa Arrizabalaga's shoulders and landed in the net.
"I just tried to get in position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave a touch and didn't think too much about it and I pulled".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the first half after the goal in the 25th minute scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue's centre forward passed Mateo Kovacic from the heel before splashing off near the midfield and shooting into the Liverpool midfield.
Kovacic made a quick pass to the halfway line.
So he made a nice pass that got Hazard in the zone.
Hazard overcame the defence and finished on the second post with a left-hand goal over Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15.00 on Thursday in London. The match is scheduled to be played at the Stade de France in the afternoon.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
There are reports of many people trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings following the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday, which generated waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was strewn with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone who may have seen or heard anything in the area to contact us.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages but I would like to appeal to anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have information that is very important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was recovered is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location of the discovery this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have stated that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will be hours before they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying "it's terrible".
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were inside the restricted area and another van was just outside.
Several officers were inside the restricted area, checking the apartment building.
Anyone with information on this is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating the register 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the latest monument to be hit by the tide of history-writing.
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England's religious and cultural objects by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "folly" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many feel should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from outside pressures, in his case obviously the monarchy.
Whether this is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of that rift.
His achievements as Lord Protector should be celebrated and commemorated".
A pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a piggy market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty was a large male pig with blood on his nose.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-pound pig had broken the breeder, according to the affidavits.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and bruised", said the cousin identified by his surname Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance video showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police gather evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for the farmer's death.
Although rare, there have been reports of attacks on humans by pigs in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a catalyst.
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious, they don't want to hurt you.
"We just have to show them the right amount of respect", he said.
Hurricane Rosa's aftermath will bring heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the US in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 hours ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical moisture northward across the southwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
So, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching rainfall will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area over the next few days.
At the local level, two to ten centimeters of rainfall could cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation rates to reach 2.5 - 7.5 cm per hour in some places, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to be between 1 and 4 inches (2.5-10 cm) in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could flood river canyons and thunderstorms will bring winds and dust.
The approaching landslide will cause heavy local rainfall over parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of over 1 cm is possible, which could cause limited debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on the Four Corners Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October will see strong temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature variations over short distances.
An outstanding example of the sensitivity of temperature differences in the central United States will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm early October is forecast for much of the central and eastern US, with 26 °C from the Southern Plains to northeastern areas.
In New York, temperatures will reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, or about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a strong chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people tuned in to six television networks Thursday to watch the compelling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute twist on Friday: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100% certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery deposition, said he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday watched the deposition.
The company was calculating media audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who watch the shows in the offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a similar audience to a football playoff or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose pundits strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day viewing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC recorded 2.94 million, MSNBC recorded 2.89 million and CNN recorded 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was filmed by CNN and CBS staffers Friday morning being insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He was blindfolded for several minutes while being reprimanded and shown live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while many women are impotent".
Flake said his office had issued the statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicising" the Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans of letting the European Union "face politics" with Britain's future and jeopardising the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the front-page interview with the Prime Minister, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect in the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities have released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
Bail has been set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department acknowledged the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the police crime lab, Southern University police, and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director thanked the area's law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-4 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team is "shocked" and "under shock" over Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano ash spray Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring the various tremors and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash coating the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have been detecting an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan secession vote.
A group of masked separatists, hampered by riot police, targeted the police with eggs and sprayed paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that are usually crawling with tourists.
There were further clashes during the day with police using batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, groups of separatists chanting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
Local media reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tension remains high in the region a year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed to secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum being held at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
The separatist groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had any hope for the possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying with joy for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked", she explained.
Despite a crucial but measurable victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement's most prominent leaders in self-imposed exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is becoming more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in jail awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"I am the best candidate for the European elections to denounce the revolution in democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government", he explained.
Londonderry: Men arrested after home invasion with car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly crashed their car into a house in Londonderry.
The accident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks the Livingston's 1-0 win against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston sealed the victory
The already promoted Livingston has stunned Rangers by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will face top-ranked Hearts next Sunday, from whom they are 8 points behind.
On Thursday, Rangers played against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its winning streak in the division by going undefeated in six games, with coach Holt still seeing a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is wasting his chances against some unobtrusive guests .
Holt's team should have been ahead long before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out of the door after he entered to meet Craig Halkett's head shot from the other side of the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors with a set kick.
And that's how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession but the home team's defence had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained throughout the second half, though Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston play.
Crosses were held in Livingston's area and were continuously neutralized, while two requests for a penalty, after Halkett's confrontation with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand-off, were refused.
A phenomenal performance from Livingston - reviewed
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
To the last player, they have been exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their playing style and staff have changed very little since their return to the majors, but you have to give Holt a lot of credit for the way he's been able to spur the team on since he arrived.
She's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in a tough spot throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were not very inspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
They missed the final pass - only once did they penetrate the opposing area - and it can be considered a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan met with mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) during the Turkish and German leaders' breakfast meeting in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at relaxing relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police motivated the intervention for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protests reflect the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after being hit by car
A cyclist has died after being struck by a car in London.
The incident occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the scene, but the man died instantly.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed by a highwayman in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's crash occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards wounded during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the maximum-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin maximum security men's prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" agents were deployed to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight inmates and was confined to one wing of the prison.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman stated: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to contain an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and may be sentenced to longer prison terms".
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to the prison to quell a violent riot in which the staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the last of Hurricane Rosa's energy crosses the desert's southwest, creating flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona through southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching on Monday on a rainy night.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 centimeters, with isolated peaks up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For areas not at risk of flash floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the southwestern area is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Initially the path of Hurricane Rosa will make landfall across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still maintaining hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds to a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the coldest waters of the Pacific, losing power.
So it's expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm this afternoon or Monday night.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico could be heavy, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Floodfall is expected to be between 3 and 5 inches from Baja California to the northwest corner of Sonora, with a maximum of 10 inches", reported weather.com.
Rosa then headed northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday with tropical depression status, then heading through Arizona and into southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that Rosa or its remnants can cause is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
Such rains are expected to generate potentially lethal flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a gunshot wound in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Authorities are appealing to anyone who may have had a cell phone recording of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered at the hands of the Democratic Party's malice and anger".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and outrageous tactics", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh has "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and forcefully denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault against him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in defense of the charge.
The president said Saturday that the American people had seen the extraordinary quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a jurist with an impeccable record in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am very busy, he said.
"For this lot I rigorously for exceptional candidates".
Trump said that Democrats are committed to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and casualty figures continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves crashing onto beaches, when a large-scale earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu City on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) high hit the beach at dusk, killing and destroying many people and everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus becoming victims", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, said in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the mainland", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed several buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was equal to almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "aesthetic" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
"Communications have been totally paralyzed, with no information from Donggala", Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area, the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious", he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alert was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building shouting in a panic to warn people in the street below of the tsunami.
A few minutes later a wall of water crashed onto the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for rescue purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's awful.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala managed to reach Palu safely, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in their office courtyard, they encountered scenes of devastation on the way, Doseba said.
"I was told that I saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's awful.
Even as rescue teams began the difficult rescue gear-up operations, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start to arrive if the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can accept international assistance, but the status hasn't been defined yet".
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
A child was pulled from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a veteran of the paragliding industry, I am carrying my emotional load", he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread within the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single grey tick instead of two blue ticks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM restock at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's operator who was restocking an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man came up behind the back of Brink's employee and stole a bag with the money for the delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the offenders is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote, "The person formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she will be performing her new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'", West said earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's about us.
We went from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye -- the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are".
He's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also changed his name with or without a comma and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, on the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco square on Saturday that "we will never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Soldiers had opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were gaining ground across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly student grants and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for the IAA
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its funding for AI research, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several groups in the US government about AI, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its programme last year: it aims to be the world's number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start considering that all other countries are way behind the US and we need a new AI revolution", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big thing in AI being achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the American player of Othello with the highest score and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, so that new visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away academic leaders, it's the multinationals", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US boost its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to IA PhD students", he explained.
China's State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to those working in academic institutions, in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at engaging industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a special commission on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US order to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on the possible change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbours' name constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would harm the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic-majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: 'Do you agree to NATO and EU membership and to accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to be paid for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
'I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us', said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in the House.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko vote for the referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging chairs in front of the tents set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go in head-up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He declared that a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, indicated that 57% of respondents expected to go to the polls on Sunday.
Of that 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal by avoiding the entire Brighton defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were in charge of Brighton's defence during Saturday's 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentine forward received a half-field pass at the start of the game.
He moved through three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming several others at the Brighton boundary.
So he made a left turn, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right shot into the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing him for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that time".
But it was Sterling who initially brought the Sky Blues to the fore in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero receives the ball deep into Brighton's court.
He threw a nice, nice, leaky ball down the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before leaving the field.
City will take on Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies .
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as competitive as ever, Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least one win coming off a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still hoping to claim their division title.
"Even if we play goalless, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team playing will probably be at its highest level this year.
And why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a first baseman for Sunday, but it's said they're leaning toward letting Scherzer pitch in these situations.
Scherzer, who would be the starting pitcher for the 34th time, pitched a shutout on Thursday and would be the starting pitcher on his regular Sunday rest.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is on the line in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate but I'm really working on it so I'm fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you can see the meanness, the meanness.
They don't care who they can hit, who they have to overpower in order to get power and control back, because that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats, he said, had given themselves the mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And you've seen it in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry, mean, petty and liars".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering loud boos from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uhm, no, I'm waiting for a -- that was terrible body language -- worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is not very tolerant anymore.
He doesn 't tolerate people who say what they think .
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, and all because they have said what they thought.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because she has stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting states that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night meetings have been exactly like this.
However, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a 'more polite and courteous' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a reversal from me and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there are a lot of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am certainly more fortunate than other colleagues, since the comments to me tend to be political in nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day but who are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy is the normalisation of the level of insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party shrinks.
Over the last two years I've been given a lot of advice, telling me to put my head down, not to express my opinions so openly and everything would be fine.
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect of my class of secondary school literally falling apart, I have tried to advocate better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way baffled by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who sponsored the motion on Friday, I would say that as the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in what I believe to be your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have upset the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that the Irish deserved the win in this exceptionally entertaining match of Tennent's championship day.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our matches so far and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to give Ayr credit, they used their opportunities better than we did".
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, cleared by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a penalty before, right at half-time, to score and then to convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was let go, and on the restart, the Ayr jumped back into the lead thanks to a Stafford McDowall goal converted by Climo.
Ayr's substitute captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose charged the man more with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine at the end of a moment of high pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a match with Climo without a ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the lead of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost from the restart, after Rowe had picked up the kick from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to seek the home side's fifth goal.
Game Still star looking for a new career in the catering business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, decided to move into the hotel business after discovering he had been appointed manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and performs with long-time partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series will also be the show's final season, and it seems that Kiernan is considering a life after Craiglang.
According to official report listings, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters clad in sartiame in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
It is our duty to recover it".
Across landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coast now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to once again traverse the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude", explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will favourably accept Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea under state jurisdiction.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year - has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts feel that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign the Chilean territory and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has torpedoed any remaining goodwill in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions after what has happened.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hague, rejected the idea that the tribunal's decision-making process was particularly expeditious.
On Monday, Bolivia will "have an extraordinary opportunity in relations with Chile" and will have the chance to "end 139 years of disagreements to mutual advantage", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political ploy.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The ruling is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won 't happen without trust in the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will never disarm from nuclear weapons unless it can first trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intent on reopening diplomatic talks that stalled after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an illusion that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration of an end to the Korean War could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to issue the statement without Pyongyang first taking major disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that it probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows feature the latest trend in giant headdresses that will soon be in a high-end store near you .
If you want to expand your collection of headdresses or block the sun's rays completely, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of oversized oversized headwear for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalks that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have been a hit on Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations onto the catwalk.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like border that flooded the models' heads.
Other oversize accessories included jewelled watermelons, a witch hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks feature sewn lips and look more like a depiction of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving suit with a mask and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
And if he continues with his huge style statements, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the giant caps could reach you on the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats come on the heels of "The Bomb", the straw hat with a wide top that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation onto the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the costume model who wears it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I predict these big beach hats and bags will be hitting luxury stores next summer, as the designer has made such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, bolstered by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other collective endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an area of education able to develop and adopt a personalised school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and in-demand subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his native language, the message will reach his heart".
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build trust with people from other countries.
From this year's examination results, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages scored highly.
Data from the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students achieved the highest mark with a pass in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish achieved the highest marks.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as core skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees gave for the difficulty of filling jobs were due in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were not able to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to be able to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%.
That's why investing in language learning is so important for children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those from developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are deemed most important for the UK looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with specialist teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future may be.
There is no denying that in a global trading system today, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'll have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first start with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the team's opening preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still to be determined how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than $48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"At this point in my career, I don't need friendly matches to prepare me", he said.
The moment of the rally a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia with a flurry of rallies.
It's the first of five scheduled Trump rallies over the next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump will try to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November elections.
What time is Trump's rally and how can you follow it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's rally in West Virginia can be followed online via YouTube Live.
Trump will likely discuss this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become tense over sexual assault allegations with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI conducts its investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans who face the November election get a little push.
So, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies over the next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so crucial to his schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busiest campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, requesting anonymity.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage from Pittsburgh", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the lead in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to fight to keep hope alive through Sunday's singles
After three one-way sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum motion is a totally invented sporting concept that players believe in firmly and never as in competitions like these.
Where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so I'd say we're saving a bit of bike", said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans feel they have a bit of a wind in their sails, as Spieth said, and have much to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been spat on from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to even the score in Game Four, when he and Thomas were down by two points after two.
His putt that won them the game on the 15th hole was met with a similar shout, the one that tells you he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You really have to worry about your game", Spieth said.
That's all any of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestioned version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovable couple from Europe are four of a kind and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only pair not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there would be no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
But the European glory speeches are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quick to catch up with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have sunk the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they have not been able to climb out.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and don't give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a major advantage on the final day but this foursome session has shown that Team USA has the courage to fight back, something that some, particularly Stateside, have doubted.
Europe 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after wrapping up Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National's scoring record to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourball, winning 3-1.
The USA held on to the foursome, winning two matches, but failed to recover their disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and American star Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed occasional glimpses of brilliance but lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourball, returned to the side of partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome to beat 2&1's Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe has not achieved all the results it hoped for on a pleasant, breezy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time grand prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a gritty 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome, having missed the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit to the singles, although as the defending champions, Furyk's team only needs a tie to defend the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea is firmly opposed to unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the sanctions were exacerbating the country's mistrust of the US, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
'We do not see any corresponding response from the US,' he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no security in our national security and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first".
Although Ri re-used the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to "phased denuclearization" that would reward North Korea with gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever full-fledged meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal agreement to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to 'have denuclearization first' and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner and even oppose the 'declaration of the end of the war,' Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust".
Ri did not refer to plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point".
But even so, the tone of Ri's speech was noticeably different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korean missiles after the evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in pursuing disarmament, but said much more needed to be done and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no deadline, saying that "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "Compliance with Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until complete, final and verifiable denuclearization is achieved".
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming progress had been made, but hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US took "compliant measures".
He said Kim had explained to him that the "compliant measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had pledged to in Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a class on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year urged all of its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing virile culture of studying for whole nights fueled by caffeine.
One university scholar found that students at the world's leading universities often have no idea of the basic concepts of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after a lecture he gave on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end a girl came up to me and said: Why am I only being told this now, when I'm in my senior year?
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was taught for the first time this year, teaches students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section is the image of a dorm room, where students can select coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it won't change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of "pride" over "the long nights at school" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough and good quality sleep should be students' secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, she explained, and should even help prevent weight gain because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California college student enrolled in chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling at this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm for when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga 's goal knocks Gerrard 's men down with a shot from the left .
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since their 4-1 February triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager leaving his side eight points adrift of the reigning Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never seemed to be able to even the score.
While Ranger now drops to sixth, Livingston moves up to third, and only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And there may be more trouble coming for the Rangers after guardalinee Calum Spence was treated for a head injury from an apparently thrown object outside the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual formation that snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team smothered their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated on ball possession, but Livingston was better at using the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just two minutes later when Menga's leaked pass in the first half sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder squandered the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs found the captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot from the side on the second stump.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their play in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a penalty at the end of the fifteenth following a clash with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to score just twice in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head-butt and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it for his commitment alone.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep-court kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure in choosing Menga for a clean finish.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change had an almost immediate impact as the winger injected a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly jumped from the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the exact kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the gap in the closing stages, but McGregor fought back to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton filed a final demand for a penalty after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the counting continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science ever since, the Geiger counter also became a mainstay of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the uncredited cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals".
Evans: "It's really going to blow up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days shy of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and altering them in the lab
They can then 'see' a protein common to many types of cancer and are then re-injected
A clinical trial of this vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can see a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then injecting those cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is throwing himself into a pro-Trump rant by wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed off Saturday Night Live after a lackluster performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA cap, she began a rant against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"I talk to white people all the time and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist!
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago, he explained.
SNL opened the show with a skit starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee against the sexual assault allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's recording of the video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West with the publication.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had a bad time backstage because of his headgear.
"I was bullied backstage.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
I was bullied!
And then I was told I was an outcast", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the underwater place?" and said, "I'd wear the Superman cape because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love".
His comments generated whistles from the audience at least twice and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper: "A dead silence fell on the studio".
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West stunned many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU PERIE FOR HAVING TENUED TO THE MASSE".
But the show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he is and this is just wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing a vomit-filled ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
And so are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend rapper Snoop Dogg went by the name Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The star of "The Game of Thrones", Kit Harington, is attacking the toxic masculinity of the character.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen soles often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something went wrong" and reflected on how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the Throne of Swords co-star, 31, admitted to worrying about this issue a lot.
'Personally I am very concerned at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' she said.
'What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes boys think they have to be this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time -- how do we change things?
Because obviously something has gone wrong with the young people.'
During the interview he also admitted that he will not be playing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels once the series is finished next summer, stating that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a mugger.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife Rose to be the best thing that happened to him on Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me this sense of my future family, and my life from now on", he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's affection, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens affected by HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities speaking at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a pressing issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to tackling the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators' data, and speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
The US congresswoman on Saturday denounced allegations against a member of her staff over the publication of personal information of three Republican US senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic congresswoman from Los Angeles said the statements were fueled by right-wing pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol staffer during a panel of experts hearing on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information about a Waters staff member.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and tendentious allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie".
Waters' claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious", Fleischer wrote.
"It implies that he does not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You must not question the reasoning of the accuser.
He must remain calm and composed".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Big if confirmed", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these biased claims.
'We will make sure that those responsible are exposed,' he continued 'and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions to all my staff.'
Johnny English's review is striking again - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become commonplace to seek Brexit references in every new film with a British twist and this seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy, begun in 2003 and brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
Is the veiled self-mockery about how much we suck the new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, the rubber-faced, out-of-sight, incompetent Johnny English has gotten his license to mess things up for a second time - and his name says more than anything that this is a comedy creation developed for non-English-speaking movie-going countries.
Of course, it's the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims to glamour has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed a single note to the theme of the Gloria moments of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten television advertisements for Barclaycard, who left chaos behind.
There are one or two funny moments in this latest Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers briefly squeezing against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor seems quite understated and eerily superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems more directed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's wild misadventures are not as original and targeted as Atkinson's silent film gags when he plays Mr. Bean.
The premise of immutable actuality now is that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the top-secret Web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a very small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for a presumptuous, troubled prime minister who is already suffering a political unpopularity meltdown: Emma Thompson does her best with this Theresa May-like character but there's not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence consultants inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you'll have to call in someone who's already retired.
And that means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school principal in a posh establishment, but who also gives off-the-record lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a School of Rock-style espionage course.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a role of high society girl in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So the Batman and Robin of disaster for His Majesty's secret services are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously into the net of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: left-wing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking onto Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality mask to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the final sequence, but as graceful and exuberant as it is, there's quite a bit of children's TV in the whole story.
The whole thing is pretty modest.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that did justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan so that British people can work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical programme that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like company bosses to pass on the savings from the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: 'A review of the policy is expected to be announced by the end of the year.'
It will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as its industrial strategy as a whole.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and is not currently being discussed.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic sphere.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from 'faceless managers' and 'speculators' in public service enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire shareholding, as the Labour government could implement 'reductions' on the basis of behaviour considered to be unlawful.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds, so that 10 per cent of the net worth of private sector firms would be transferred to employees, who would end up pocketing annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising questions about whether the government agency's findings will influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that will air Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible that the FBI could bring something to light that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said as I was heading to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, that that accusation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be etched in stone.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could withstand a bomb-proof indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vigorously denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whoever you nominate couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a remarkable parade of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness about the event's real purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, precisely, now that it's 12 years away from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to request a call to action, or is it just another example of so-called clicktivism - people who feel they are really making a difference by simply signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters, and used them for a variety of purposes.
It states that these actions have helped to urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, designed to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that hedge funds have so far directly impacted some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and developer partnership committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, they asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: It will be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among those who will be performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to implement 'blockade' and hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can, "if necessary", use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available in the market, including in the Middle East, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe", he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
'The US has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that waterways remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market', he said.
Zinke addressed the respondents at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that calls itself the 'voice of energy consumers' in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as "not versatile" with an "economy that depends on fossil fuels".
The statements were made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to boost its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of Nord Stream 2, the "improper" gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2, an $11 billion pipeline designed to double the capacity of the existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of a purely economic nature.
The Kremlin objects that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is driven purely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
'I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have a choice of suppliers,' said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, following a meeting in Moscow in September with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary.
The US position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of the European Union's energy policies and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I see it as a big problem that a third state interferes with our energy supply,' said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that implies having a woman at the top", she said, as reported by The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
During the town hall Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: "Naturally, we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such a nomination.
The poll found stronger support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed as potential 2020 candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks about Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming back, I can relate to other families who are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries that our troops come back with", he told the crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other veterans, "They come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the military, have devoted themselves to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report for domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are waging a legal battle against a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who was challenging that policy, as NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner and his violent gang-member sons abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was taken into custody in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, the District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine declared that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum requests be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a prohibition violates that principle, the amicus curiae brief states.
In the memo, prosecutors also argued that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear likelihood that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and provide the labor needed.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is open to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion", Mr Sessions said on 11 June, as part of his policy announcement.
The shelter was never meant to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate attempts at recovery in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation grew more and more desperate.
"There is a lot of tension", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her fevered baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
There's an ambulance bringing bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, sifting through their muddy personal effects in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken shoulder and back, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continuous strong aftershocks.
Tears welled up in his eyes as he described the sensation of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
There was no time to save us.
"I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a US newspaper, touting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid ad by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the highest selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge that China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their respective imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-time Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now increasing those bullies by running propaganda ads in our free newspapers".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
Conversely, in the street stall here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions the Chinese people might have about China's troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has evaded the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
With many leading Republicans defending Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and siding with him in the face of various sexual harassment allegations, analysts have signaled that a backlash, especially from women, will be seen in the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially indicated that they want to go ahead with a vote.
"You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate chamber on Friday morning, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to the stars", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say they were already tall; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote despite not liking the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of her sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a backlash could occur if Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"It's become a confusing set for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final committee vote or whether Kavanaugh will be brought to the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled the situation and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat split over who to believe in following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her while she was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals during a party while studying at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that traces its origins to Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will have access to and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden purpose behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it personal empowerment through data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, the company's CEO, is to bring the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely disrupted overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a Medium post published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide the commercial power and ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the clergyman of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been commemorated in his home town after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had been awarded the highest level of British military honour.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog, under heavy fire from the field and war machines".
He then rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be proud of and something that makes me more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt truly honored to play a role in the parade and added the value of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given to him by many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, and instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 fights, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some have remained built up after staying up until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, one fan described the move to children's cartoons as "a sort of bad joke".
"The government regulation is that at 6 a.m. that content is no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to kids programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the pig, yes.
Scott Coker, Bellator's chairman, said they will work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution", Coker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday, and we won't be able to find a solution until Sunday in our time zone, Monday in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when he changed his schedule, there were a lot of messages coming in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government issue.
I promise you that next time won't happen.
We're gonna limit it to five fights instead of six, which we normally do, and we've tried to get a lot of fanfare, and we just talked about it.
It's a very unpleasant situation.
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but this provided the motivation for him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he was in high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The show's longtime host Kirsty Young has taken a series of months off sick leave.
Introducing himself as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley stated that he felt "less than everybody else" while growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable that I liked both boys and girls".
She said, "Today, the feeling of being less than, and of being different, is what really gave me the strength and the energy to be able to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they accidentally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "took me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced such highs and lows.
The two became parents in June of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole outlook" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father hadn't accepted the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'You won't be around to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I still didn't realize he wasn't invincible", she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to swim in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still makes him go crazy.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mickelson was benched in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record-setting 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his game on the range, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Having never been the strongest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the unconnected course regularly punishes wrong shots.
And if the course itself wasn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match Sunday, faces defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of their 12th singles match, start with a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it had to go.
He wants to be involved, just like everyone else.
Mickelson on Sunday will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never even remotely matched the heights of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence has brought intangible assets to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and is a great guy to have in the boardroom", she explained.
I also think the younger players have had a lot of fun playing against him this week, which has been fun to watch.
He did more than play.
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable lead in the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward chase.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama in which the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep telling myself that we had a good lead in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but by a little bit", said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the 2018 class win, Friday by 5-3 and yesterday by 10-6 at Le National Golf.
So it's going to be history that shows me and my team that it's not over.
We have to do our best tomorrow.
You gotta go out there and do everything right.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
Our goal is to try and win the trophy, and that's what we have to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world.
Happy with the way his team competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: I would have never made it.
Tomorrow's is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the one-man show, which is another.
It's nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're alone your golf skills are put to the ultimate test.
That's the message we need to send to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in you.
Then, you forget about your partner because he has to go there and get the best out of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three out of four points.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides of those big last-day matches, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players to the top on the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start on the right foot as we did at Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and we classify the kids in whatever way we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we're going to try to do a magic trick.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counter-offensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
'I chose this order because I think it covers the route to the end,' Bjorn said of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany 's new warship has been delayed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to faulty systems and increased costs.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues following delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as miniaturized radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, as it should be possible to deploy new frigates for up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will already be obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have noted a number of crucial "software and hardware" flaws that made the ship unusable if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it was found that the ship weighs significantly too much, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, at 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It seems to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent alarms about the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy was actually 'lacking ships that could be used'.
The official said that the issue has worsened considerably over time, as the old, disarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates has been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is spying on the secret life of bats
New research on a Highland farm in Scotland aims to reveal how bats use their eyes to find food.
Hopefully, the findings will shed light on the behavior of the only flying mammals in existence and guide future conservation efforts.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as brown-eared bats and Daubenton's bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
An expert's analysis of the recorded sounds will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and the way each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the findings will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the past century.
Bats are at risk due to construction and development work affecting the three-pole and ruining the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito-repellent paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles along their path.
LNTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the three-pointers, and occasionally perform rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first bat-only reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the property is ideal territory.
"Here in Threave we have a vast area for bats", he said.
We have the old buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bats that we don't know yet, so the work we're doing here and at other properties is going to help us understand more about their growth needs.
It emphasises the importance of controlling bats before carrying out maintenance on properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single mother litter can kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trespoles.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He stated: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel which published the accusations.
The Portuguese Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also reported on Friday that the accusation of paying $375,000 to keep the story quiet.
In a video on Instagram directed to his 142 million followers, in the hours after the accusations, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the claims as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today is false", says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner facing the camera.
They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's all right.
They want to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the game.
I'm happy and everything is fine", added the footballer with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of suspicions about the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the footballer will ask for compensation for "moral damage in the measure corresponding to the gravity of the violation of privacy, considered, probably, one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a disco, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the footballer's room, where he raped her anal, according to statements filed with the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo would have gotten down on his knees after the incident saying that he was for the 99 percent a good guy disappointed by one percent.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliatory agreement because she felt "terrified by the retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and will join Italian club Juventus this summer on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever mourn the loss of car manufacturers
The UK 'could regret forever' the loss of its status as the world's leading car manufacturer following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark has said.
He also said he was 'concerned' by the statements Toyota UK made to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary halt to production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
'We need an agreement', said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker claims that delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could affect jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which builds the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Concern is growing among other British car manufacturers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern is the supply chain risks faced by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on the 'just in time' concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from British and European suppliers for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be discomfort at the borders which would cause delays and shortages of parcels.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark says that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely designed to avoid these border disasters".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow us to not only enjoy the success we have now but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota was not able to say for how long production could be stopped but, in the long run, warns that the additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant's trade union delegates, says that the workers are very concerned: 'In my experience, once jobs are cut, they are not re-placed'.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU'.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for a week" as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has fueled months of gossip in Washington.
Later that month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and there were rumors that he was resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Wednesday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a superposition with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI cross-examination of Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's final vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, I guess she'll stay another week considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll keep the press updated.
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders claimed that the lack of briefing was not due to an "aversion for television journalists" who "showed up", though he said, "I'm not displeased with the fact that they show up".
He therefore suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any president before him", he said, adding without citing evidence: "We've checked the numbers".
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this, as we have done in the last few weeks, and this will replace briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the President may have proved his point, giving a free-wheeling, yet bizarre speech to a group of reporters.
Health minister writes to European NHS workers in Scotland to express his concerns over Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meeting the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the devolved public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "There have been ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit throughout the summer, leading to decisions in the autumn.
But the UK Government has also prepared for the eventuality of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
I therefore wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, irrespective of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much wish you to remain here.
Christie Abercrombie had emergency surgery for a head injury .
Tennessee State Tigers defenceman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Tennessean.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came close to the edge of the field and fainted", Reed said.
First responders and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie at the scene, before placing him on a stretcher and taking him away for further examination.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he was being treated for a brain tumor.
Harris added that "we have no news yet of the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duties for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duties for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to Labour's new plans
The move will counter the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay UK taxes
The Treasury is planning to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay UK tax, and the additional resources will support the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties, could be more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the scheme to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the property market.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping house prices high by grabbing land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to forgo quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's housing "disgrace".
Mr Corbyn has announced a stunning series of proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and the elimination of no-fault evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new buildings.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if the purchase of a house were as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies as it is for UK resident workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate aspiration is to lead Scotland".
Sunderland's technical director Jack Ross says his "highest aspiration" is to become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is drawn to the challenge of lifting the North East side who currently sit in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after being in charge of St Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in the B series and that's all", Ross told the BBC Scotland programme Sportsound.
I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampdins with my father as a kid, and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I am successful as a team manager.
Ross's predecessors at the helm of Sunderland have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic claims he has no anxiety about following such big names in an equally important team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by the ability to get the team back in the Premier League".
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without doubt to the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only succeed if I can get the team back on track.
Ross's managerial career began three years ago, after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and took St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims he feels much more comfortable now than he did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
'It was probably a real turning point', he recalls about the direction of the 'Alloa'.
I really thought the role of manager was meant for me, more than the role of player.
It seems odd because I've worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to deal with on a weekly basis.
I'm still dealing with it in terms of stress and pressure of the job, but the management seems good.
I've always wanted to direct and now I do, I feel much more at ease than I ever have in my life.

According to one study, the best time for a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to Britain's struggling pubs and more concern to food services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy firm CGA, put the data together and commented: "The persistence of sunshine and England's long stay at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 per cent, while restaurants were hit harder.
The £1.8 per cent drop in the catering industry in June was worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where most people drink were the most stable, with a more consistent increase than the decline in restaurants.
The pubs where people eat have also suffered from the heat, although not as badly as the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the pubs and bars they run, beverage sales rose by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food consumption fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, Recreation and Hospitality Sector Analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales per year will be particularly damaging in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the restaurateurs and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we enjoyed in August will give us a much-needed reprieve.
The overall increase in sales between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand roll-outs.
The sales tracking company Coffer Peach Tracker for UK pubs, bars and restaurants gathers and analyses performance data across 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social network accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has reinforced fears that sexually explicit content is being posted
20% of students said they have a "main account" to show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social network accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of "fake" accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has reinforced fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean "main" account to show their parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".

Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board at the National General Assembly of the Administrative Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and chairman Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for those running the sport to take advantage of his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is deeply respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that Scotland athletics could benefit enormously from bringing her on board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as the voice of athletes and hope I can contribute and help drive sport in Scotland".
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic gold medals, and currently a BBC commentator, has been found unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if and to what extent I would recover.
It was a grueling job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I move with agility!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!
A milkmaid's ad compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A company that produces a milk carton has divided opinion online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being billed as the "world's first silent, wearable strap-on", consumer technology company Elvie has launched an advertisement in the form of a mocking music video to showcase the freedom of expression as mothers given by the new strap-on.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like "Yes, I'm getting my milk but I don't have a thing" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't breasts but my boobs".
The chorus goes on: "I'll get it out, I'll get it out, I'll feed the children, I'll get it out, I'll get it out, I'll get the milk for my ladies".
However, the advertisement, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has elicited mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom have argued that it highlights the horrors of thedairy industry.
An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must also get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their young are stolen from them within days of birth", wrote one person.
Elvie's bra strap is worn discreetly under a mom bra.
Someone else commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a leaflet for mothers who will continue to keep their babies?
Another added: "It's really a nonsensical advertisement.
Others have defended it, and one woman even admitted to finding the song "funny".
"I think that's a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd have one.
When I used the milk thinner, I felt like a cow.
The advertising is a bit irreverent but it's not far from reality.
This is a genius product", someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny commercial dedicated to mothers who use the straw (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'"
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women in the video show that they danced with the discreet strap on their bra.
The campaign's concept is based on the idea that many women who use the milk straw feel like cows.
The Elvie strap, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and can be tucked into a breast-feeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold babies and even go outside while they are pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD of Mother commented: "The Elvie trailers are such a revolutionary product that they deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the cow's tracheotomy, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tracheotomy is able to provide".
This isn't the first time that Elvie the sweeper has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two showed up on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent city on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policy line have made it more difficult to take care of these children.
Most of those who took them in were usually illegal immigrants who now fear that they would jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be passed to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who offered to take in unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who offer to take in children or are family members of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal aliens.
We are therefore continuing to hunt down these people", said Albence.
To try to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days, according to those working at the reception centers.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for aid will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children stay in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent fits of anger or attempts to escape, according to those working in the shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure like the Tornillo one where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children's signals of discomfort to be ignored.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many are already facing.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war has entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally occupying Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions have been forced from their homes since 2011.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and support Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
The European Parliament has also called for the EU to take action to prevent the spread of the virus, and to ensure that the virus is contained.
'We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to intervene to facilitate their return,' he said.
"What should be a purely humanitarian problem is being politicized".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a widespread attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise timelines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including the fighters of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work must be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency is not prematurely ended by impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential end ever!"
At this point, there's no sign of a decline in viewership.
Since 2014, the primetime ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers on its first night, up sharply from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the network's ratings, reaching 3.5 million viewers on its top news evenings.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something that can't be explained", says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's "Designated Survivor" television series, which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an accomplished writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a Boston cab ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
And he said, "Because it makes me laugh".
Chaos is therefore a source of amusement.
Of course, unlike any other TV show, the plot of Washington's events can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade decision, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
But not following the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, he goes beyond his duty as an informed citizen to find himself following a panel of experts for the sixth consecutive hour as they discuss Bob Woodward's extensive research for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("a garment full of workmanship", The Washington Post commented), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' disgusting descriptions of Trump's anatomical parts.
I, for one, will never be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
"Part of the reason why what he does feels like a reality show is that there's something new every night", says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", about the casting and day-to-day developments of Trump's show (in contrast to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll be left behind.
This week I went to visit Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai, and despite it being a sunny day with nearly 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right".

Flow of foreign money in the race for the closest midterm elections
It's no surprise that the 17th district is seeing an influx of money thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has two incumbent members now running for the same seat.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh brings into the picture Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district overlapping the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts' electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has sparked a campaign marked by a fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The US thought of penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then changed their minds
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, there was a rather cordial meeting between the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization's leadership team to leave.
State Department officials have decided to repatriate the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to apply sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received from the Americans about 140 million dollars in aid for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been worrying for the Central American country with its high rate of unemployment and homicide.
After a series of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in the effort to stop migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made it clear that they intended to proceed with the conference and thus definitively waive any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a demonstration of the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of reprimand or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton spokesman at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about the domestic decisions.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who has chosen to remain anonymous.
Study the story
In the report that he will publish, special prosecutor Robert Mueller may accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, for which there now seems to be sufficient evidence.
The Mueller investigation is reportedly intended to shed light on Trump's possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress switches to the Democrats, Trump should answer to these charges in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his own peers as he prepares for a new run.
The unknowns are many, and I don't mean that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight may last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and backed the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed on that occasion to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several at the moment.
What if Trump decides to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated since this very newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested subjecting Trump to wiretapping, casting doubt on his ability to reassume the role of president.
Rosenstein claims that the story in The Times is not true.
"How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and perjury?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable for his actions?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll get through this.
My mother was a Jewish Czechoslovak who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can only be optimistic about the future".

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna encounter
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following a convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them a good chance of qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
Although a knee injury has left midfielder Graham Dorrans playing his first match of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result can allow Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game feeling good and we brought home a point.
We might have won in extremis, but, all in all, the tie is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second half we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to get the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last game but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not disappoint.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club level but now the feeling is positive.
The team is in good shape, the boys are having fun and the preparation is going well.
We can then forget the problems of the past season and think about the future".
Women are concerned about the cost of long-term care
Although those surveyed had clear ideas about the kind of care they would like to receive, few had discussed the issue in their families.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide say that they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had discussed the subject with their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, "people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't have that conversation".
That's where we start.
Talk to your mate and your children about it. You cannot prepare your family to attend if you do not communicate your wishes in time.
If you have a counselor, discuss with him and your family where and how you want to receive care, as these factors can determine the cost.
Involve a financial adviser who can advise you on how to pay for the expenses you will have to face.
Choosing a long-term care financing may include a traditional life insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with a surrender value to cover these expenses or continue to pay for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary paperwork to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care proxy so that someone you trust can oversee medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in detail so that you are always ready.

"What are the medications?
Who's going to take care of the dog?

The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are down and rescue workers have been unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island and with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of sustenance for the economy of Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami hit the western area of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia lies in the seismic zone known as the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries along the Indian Ocean coast, killing 226,000 people, including more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern area of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that rattled the southern coastline killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stopped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on a domestic violence charge.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a tip-off issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her phone out of her hand.
Palin has been transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bond has been set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three counts of first-degree assault, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of justice, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications systems are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi which is located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in a new federal court for the suspected terrorists in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the mastermind of the terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been carried out for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot van to crash into a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, striking pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under the conditions for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder in the first degree, a charge typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a real amount of planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notice states that "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York prosecuted its last capital punishment case.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was proud of what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty and life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier pleaded with prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage has to lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference today.
When one of Theresa May's party's MPs suggested that he should take over the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would "already be out of Europe" if Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party were highlighted by the Remain Tories who participated in a separate anti-Brexit protest in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to apply the Chequers Plan amidst the attacks of the Brexit supporters, the Remainers and the European Union.
Allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting the negotiations with Brussels should be given to Farage.
"We'd be out of Europe by now", he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country".
Bone dismissed the views that public opinion would change from the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false".
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the rally and told reporters: "I just tell the Prime Minister to listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it and it does not enjoy the favor of our party and our activists who go out in the streets to hunt for votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening".
In a sharp message to May, he added: "Prime Ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow that".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the pressure on our political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We intend to mobilise the people's army of this country who voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-sufficient and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have pushed the Tories against the Brexit flags after the group's formation this weekend.
Labour mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland", he added.
It's all a sham.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president .
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will seriously consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future at a town meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The possibility that he could challenge Trump in 2020 has been in the air for some time.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to come to Washington to fix government, and that means a woman in the highest office".
Arrested for the murder of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday, he posted a video of the murder, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head", police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the crime scene with a gun and that he hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior from Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, including 10 as a starter, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title after his victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the orders from the Mercedes team would heavily influence the race.
From the pole, Bottas starts well, leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stops first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the tail of the group, a move that could be decisive.
Mercedes made a stop on the next lap, returning to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after some wheel-to-wheel action in which the Ferrari driver tried to prevent him from passing inside, risking to finish out after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the back row of the grid but by the end of the first lap he's already seventh on his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for most of the race without stopping at the pits for a tyre change and tries to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
However, he had to make a pit stop on lap 44 and in the remaining 8 laps he was unable to increase his pace and overtake Raikkonen, who finished fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri has worked so well all weekend and he was so kind to let me pass.
The team did an outstanding job to win the first and second places", said Hamilton.
A bad example of body language.
In a rally Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for insisting she hadn't disclosed the contents of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are "mean, mean and liars".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, mean and lying", he said.
"When there are obvious signs that the news is getting out and the people in charge are saying, 'Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember his response -- did you reveal the contents of the document?
Oh, no, you're not.
I didn't do that".
Hold on a second.
We revealed it... No, we didn't", she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies that the leak was leaked from her office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's allegations, but I didn't reveal her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential, and I did".
But his denial is not believable to the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented, "I'll tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen".
In continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own ends.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to regain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.

Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have recovered from Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the return leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants have jumped into the lead with two outs from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the game before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had come back and won the match against Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have met four times this season and the Giants have won their first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes with an assist from David Rutherford.
In what was a pretty lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the equaliser to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer has given the Giants the lead by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team fought back and Bouchard regained the lead after a strategic move at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which brought Dundee into the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and he scored his team's fifth goal midway through the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his seat in the tower of control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was swaying fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
So he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is a very sad news for us", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands and the National Disaster Response Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many more", explains agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial ships are carrying supplies and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
"Malls are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse".
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation related activities.
Are you ready?" as reported by CNN.
Indonesia had already been struck by earthquakes in Lombok during the year, where 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims there is a missing person after the lagoon accident
The airline that flew the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board including passengers and crew members had managed to survive, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini's news, updated to Saturday afternoon, one passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were able to rescue the other passengers and crew after the incident occurred as the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were hospitalized Saturday and all are in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim the plane crashed into the lagoon because it missed the runway.
Some witnesses claim the plane overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes stated that the plane came to a very low altitude.
"And it was a real fortune", Jaynes said.
Jaynes went on to explain that he and others, by walking in the waist-deep water, managed to reach the plane's emergency exits.
He added that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he was lightly shot in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier also provided rescue by using a dinghy to transport the people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents involving aircraft of PNG-registered airlines, but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
The presentation of the prosecution's evidence in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 concluded on Saturday.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered the location data from several cell phones that prove that, contrary to his claim, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth in claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate that she's known him for only a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge plans to move the jury to a later date.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by inserting positive messages in their songs.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, argues that hip-hop has moved away from its roots as it has spread political messages and denounced social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and do a conscious hip-hop again.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common have recently returned to prominence in the UK thanks to the likes of Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her with "racist" text
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message in which the mother complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and compares the request to a real "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, who arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband, which was not found.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, "embarrassed" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that she had been unhappy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Miss Maurice for the day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, as a result of being fired, she is seeking a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent you a text message saying something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you trust your children to someone you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
I think not".
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You can't go around harassing a person like this.
It's not very nice", the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has immediately denounced the spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher was afraid that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter: "It is not easy to put oneself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny now that we know the great success of Paddington".
Saying that his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she adds that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person", he says.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he acted like you have a son who's reached a milestone: you're proud of him even if it's not your fault.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success in that way.
Although a figment of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself".
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
On landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter would not make it", Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then she called me to say she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medication that the doctors had given her to allow her heart to keep pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while ago and that was the end.
I had to sit and wait knowing all this was going on.
I couldn't complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
"Nobody knew", he says.
"All the time I've been crying my head off.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Tickets from two grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are committed to preventing others from committing the same act.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted on a bridge in Wales cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said it lit up every room it went into".
But before he died, he left his job because depression had brought him "to a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear that a chain effect is occurring".
He created the cards "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to for advice, even if it is a friend.
They must not isolate themselves, they must speak".
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"You never said he was down or depressed", she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
"Christmas Day was the lowest point of his life, and when the children opened their presents, he avoided looking them in the eye".
She says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "He tore the family apart.
He tore us to pieces.
But we had to go on and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI has begun an investigation.
"I think if we could proceed as he has asked, which is to say with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "losing its temper" because of the blockade of hard-line supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
With just five weeks to go before the November 6 midterm elections, if the Republicans, as expected, get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their bid to get the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court elected.
George W. Bush called senators to lobby for support for Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What's gonna happen after the FBI completes its report?
The vote will be in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the deadlock and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees 'decreases' with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing South Korea's Unification Ministry, said that the number of refugees reached 1,127 last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees charged by those who smuggle these people out.
Pyongyang has not made public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in broad terms to work together to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and argues he is not fit for the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not characteristically fit to serve.
Pelosi expressed this view Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had behaved in the same way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
In a visibly emotional way, Kavanaugh denied the accusation that he sexually harassed Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh began his speech with a sense of excitement that almost reached a scream and a choked-up cry as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee who called the charges against him an "absurd and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he can't get on the Supreme Court because he's shown he's biased against Democrats.
"I think he's self-exclusively with his statements and the way he's talked about the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and if the Democrats were to achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is it not fit for the Supreme Court, but it's not fit for the court that you're presiding over right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said that "you cannot send a hysterical, partisan person to the Supreme Court and expect this decision to be welcomed".
And women have to use it.
It's a fairy tale, months and years of tantrums that he can't get out of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And she went on to say, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, and she told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique where when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm mad at you".
And so it went on.
I thought it was a brilliant idea".
Tears are tolerated as an outlet of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories I have of a previous job in a male-dominated office is when I once started crying in a fit of rage, and a woman older than me, a glacial manager that I had always been slightly terrified of, grabbed me by the throat and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you cry", he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they have you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, partnered with Gary Hart in his presidential run.
In 1987, when Hart's extramarital affair was discovered on a boat called Monkey Business and she had to drop out of the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't try for president herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision", he said, laughing about it 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was certainly no need for another.
Some called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was already in its late stages, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and vowed that she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause at first.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the male candidates $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When she gave the speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, disappointment with the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sex discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
"It seemed like I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalled thinking about the press reaction.
"Some might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe he "Cried a lot".
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the US-China trade war have been loud and, while the battle is far from over, experts say a confrontation between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, has already issued the first warning this year by taxing China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on over $200 billion worth of items, meaning that taxes will be applied to half of all Chinese goods.
Beijing has responded with similar measures, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to hit back at the US, and it's unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will back down any time soon.
For Washington to back down, it would have to give in to its demands, but publicly giving in to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts, however, believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in either country is actually much more dangerous than has been recognized so far", says Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
'Today the situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government continues to recover the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid that is conditional or from those countries that have supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA have lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water on the par 3 16th hole, giving the win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian has excelled in all of his tournaments, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament was first played in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by European team's lower ranked Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen with a score of 5&4.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have been playing in his last Ryder Cup.
Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain, who has played in eight, has become the most successful European player in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
It's a team victory and I'm glad I contributed", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the bat to his compatriot John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in Sunday's singles.
"If I think I grew up watching him play, I'm really very proud that I beat Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now his Ryder Cup record stands at 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic when you consider that he's one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been trying all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain USA Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put Team Europe under pressure.
We threw away this opportunity.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players have been very good.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I'm fond of these 12 boys and proud to be their captain.
We put everything we had into it.
But they played better than us".
Red tide update: concentration is dropping in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchiness conditions, suggesting a decreased concentration, are evident in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The patches are located about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County but in less areas than last week.
The red tide has been observed in Pasco County as well.
Last week there was a reported average concentration in Pinellas County or off its coast, a low to high concentration off Hillsborough County, a bottom to high concentration in Manatee County, a bottom to high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coast, a bottom to medium concentration in Charlotte County, a bottom to high concentration in Lee County or off its coast, and a low concentration in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
While last week, there were no reported cases in northwest Florida.
