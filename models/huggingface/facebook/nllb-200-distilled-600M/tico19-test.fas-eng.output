The outbreak of the rapidly spreading coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing prevalence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Economic Area/EU, and the UK confirms that while in different countries we are in different stages of the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic in all countries is progressing rapidly.
Based on the experience of Italy, other countries, hospitals and special care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who need healthcare and special care.
On December 31, 2019, a group of pneumonia cases from an unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus variant called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).
Evidence so far has shown that about 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have a chronic illness, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these cases recover.
In about 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 turns into a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6 percent experience a critical condition requiring special care.
The mortality rate of patients in hospital due to COVID-19 is about 4 percent.
In this study, we assess the trend of increasing prevalence of the coronavirus in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK) and compare them with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, with the number in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of the COVID-19 virus in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread to more geographic areas and the dynamics of the pandemic in other parts of the world are currently shifting from the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues in the journal Eurosurveillance reported on 5 March 2020 the first confirmed COVID-19 outbreak in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, three cases confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 were reported from people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) where, as of 31 December 2019, 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 confirmed cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative number and prevalence of cumulative cases of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), cases of COVID-19 in various countries around the world are obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, the National and Regional Health Organization and the World Health Organization, which are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare it with the trend of the disease in Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the total prevalence of COVID-19 cases over 14 days and thus took into account the natural COVID-19 period in the EU/EEA countries and the UK from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The number of reported cases from each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. was also compared with cases reported in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The COVID-19 trend in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day prevalence of the COVID-19 outbreak in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally depends on the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
Overall, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak began to rise around 21 February and then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (additional demands).
This is mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar increase in the cumulative COVID-19 outbreak (additional demands).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This figure indicates that on 15 March at 8am, the total number of cases reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK is comparable to the number of cases in Italy in the three weeks before or less.
The results suggest that the number of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative outbreak of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is currently progressing at almost the same rate in all countries.
While countries are at different stages of the disease, the response of public health organizations is variable and there are likely to be different definitions and protocols in countries for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including increasing the speed of testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the virus-affected regions of Italy described a situation in which about 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed special care and media sources reported that hospitals and special care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Information on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospital or special care unit is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not indicated).
To complement current surveillance data, which focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths, this information should be collected systematically.
A study conducted between 11 and 2010 found that access to special care and mid-care beds varies greatly in Europe, from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
Countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 beds of special care and medium care per 100,000 inhabitants in the year 2010-11)
Modelling scenarios related to saturated healthcare capacity, with satisfaction for various EU/EEA countries and the UK in particular the outbreak of COVID-19 cases in hospital beds in connection with occupying more than 90% of the bed capacity of the special care unit, are presented in the sixth updated ECDC COVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since cases are classified in specific regions of European/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and special care units usually serve the population of a single area, information on cases and special care beds should preferably be available in the list of territorial units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy and the ongoing trend in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK is progressing rapidly.
Hospitals and special care units should therefore prepare themselves for a sustainable transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially special care, such as the situation in affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, preventive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 is necessary, with a rapid change from a more moderate approach to reducing it, as predicting a rapid increase in the number of cases if not carried out too soon may cause decision-making bodies and hospitals to lack enough time to understand, accept and apply their own response based on this trend.
A rapid risk assessment, public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic list.
There is a short-term opportunity for the remaining countries to increase self-regulatory measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the healthcare sector.
Failure to do so will likely put the healthcare system of other EU/EEA countries in a position to face a wave of patients who will need special care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000 people and the infection of 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, which is a disaster for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2 as well as a similar virus, SARS, which killed thousands of people in 2003, may have been transmitted from bats and, through a similar mechanism, caused similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower mortality rate and severity than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older people more than younger men and men more than women.
In response to the large number of published claims about this emerging disease, this paper seeks to provide an informal and comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding research topic.
We will cover the basic principles of epidemiology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this article will help us understand and eradicate this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who, due to the outbreak of a new viral disease, were forced to spend all the holidays and stay home for several weeks afterwards.
It is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); as a result, the virus was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the related disease as well as CoV Disease-19 (Covid-19) was designated.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, of which more than 40,000 licensed patients and more than 3,000 patients had died.
The World Health Organization warned that COVID-19 is the number one enemy of the people and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on 7 January 2020 in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, causology, diagnosis and treatment have been published that have identified the sequence of viruses isolated from the body of a few patients.
In this article, we will try to periodically aggregate the progress of research in this new and rapidly developing area.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other infectious diseases caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which was first discovered in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and treatment of the disease, as well as some other essential questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens to humans, mainly leading to about 15 percent of common colds.
But in this century, we have faced two highly pathogenic human COVID-19 infections, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible outbreak and mortality rate.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third largest outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a number of cases of pneumonia with an unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the Twali CoV was spread.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case was reported in Wuhan.
At the same time, the epidemic spread rapidly to her city, Estonian and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a new healthcare staff report was released, indicating that human-to-human transmission is possible.
On January 23, residents of Wuhan were quarantined and public transportation was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency on January 30.
By the time this report was prepared, the disease had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation is rapidly changing, the final extent and severity of the outbreak remain a matter of determination.
On February 11, 2020, a study conducted in several centers on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases showed a picture of the outbreak in the following way (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People with SARS-CoV-2 are of different ages, but are mainly 30 to 65 years old.
Nearly half (47.7 percent) of those affected were over 50, a very small number were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
People infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to be male (0.31/100,000) than female (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in different clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
The initial period until diagnosis of COVID-19 was on average 5 days (2-9 days).
The average duration of the disease was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The period from onset to death was on average 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The number of seraphim bases (R0) is equal to 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people diagnosed with the disease rose significantly before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the busy transportation season, before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality among patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the regulated mortality among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 included sex (male), age (over 60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a unique strand of RNA-sensitive organisms.
These viruses can be divided into four classes alpha, beta, gamma and delta, with specific types of alpha and beta CoVs that can be implanted into humans.
The glycoprotein membrane (S) is attached to the angiotensin host cell and is converted to enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in the cytoplasm; after viral genome multiplication, the RNA genome with glycoprotein envelope and nucleoacid proteins forms varion-containing sacs, which are then connected by the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
By genetic matching over 99/98 percent of 10 sequence samples collected from the original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, it was determined that SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through a transitional electron microscope examination, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-thin tissue lining of the human airway.
It was determined that ACE2 in humans acts as a carrier for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein from SARS-CoV-2, which is weaker than SARS-CoV, binds to human ACE2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes fewer infections than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral disease preventing the spread of IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the human ACE2-related creativity structure EM with full-length RA with a resolution of 2.9 angestrums in the compound with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this compound, which had open and packaged forms synthesized as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind two S proteins together, which could be evidence for identifying CoV and infection.
B0AT1 can be converted into a targeted therapy for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The establishment and host media.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been found to have originated from bats and have been transmitted to humans through cat litter and camel litter, respectively.
By comparing the felogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, it was determined that bats are native hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs with the SARS-like origin of which is the bat SL-CoVZX45 and the bat SL-CoVZX21.
However, the question of what median host helped the virus to pass through the dams of species to infect humans remains unanswered and the route of transmission still needs further clarification.
G and colleagues believe that the mice containing the synthesis of the S-protein have acted as carriers of the virus from bats on humans.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, based on the synthesis of 99 percent of the genetic coefficients in the CoV detected in pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, stated that perhaps eating pangolin - a type of long-horned ant that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - may have acted as a potential host medium for SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference that has spread over the two genomes is still very large; therefore, we are still waiting for definitive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV survive in dry conditions for up to 48 hours and at a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and a humidity of 40 to 50 percent for up to 5 days in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes, ethers, 75% ethanol, anti-inflammatory substances containing chlorine, prostactic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, and these can effectively deactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore prone to contracting the new virus.
At present, no detailed study of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Figure 4.4).
Generally, after a virus attacks the host cell, virus identification is initially performed by the host's personal immune system through the prognosis receptors (PRRs) including C-type sub-lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus, through various pathways, causes inflammatory factors to appear, reaching the dendritic cells and the synthesized interferon type (IFN) which results in limiting the spread of the virus and speeding up the macrofacial phagocytosis of the virus antigen.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
The adaptive immune system will soon be able to fight the virus.
Their T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific viral antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Helper T cells are able to help defend cells by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies as well as are essential in fighting viral infections.
For example, an antibody isolated from a patient who has recovered causes the neutralization of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an over-reaction of the immune system leads to the production of large amounts of free radicals in a localized form that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst-case scenario lead to multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of a happier appearance, most often affects older people with underlying diseases and pregnant women.
A common theme is that people who are exposed to high amounts of the virus or whose immune system functions are poorly functioning are more likely than others to become infected.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the mean time of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was determined to be equal to 14-1 days, but in most cases lasts 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average period of inactivity is 3 days, and in the time interval from zero to 24 days.
A more recent study shows, as explained above, that the period of inactivity is 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days) which is based on statistics from 8,866 cases.
This is very important for health facilities to be able to determine the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of inactivity, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected individuals who have no symptoms to others.
A common method is that people exposed to the virus or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
In most cases, the main and primary symptom is COVID-19, which can be symptomless or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal cramping, chest pain, diarrhea, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced respiratory distress or decreased oxygenation in the tissues a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease quickly progresses to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and blood clotting disorders.
Patients with fever or symptoms of severe respiratory and fever, even without any abnormalities in the radiological images, should be screened for the virus early for diagnosis.
A population study in late December 2019 showed that 98 percent of patients had symptoms: 98 percent were feverish, 76 percent were dry, 55 percent were breathless, and 3 percent had diarrhea; eight percent of patients needed a ventilator.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a transmission cluster from an individual without symptoms.
A 2012 population study showed that in patients with MERS-CoV, fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) were the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed a ventilator, which is much more than the COVID-19 patients, indicating that MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99 to 100 percent), dry cough (29 to 75 percent), shortness of breath (40 to 42 percent), diarrhea (20 to 25 percent) and gluten (13 to 25 percent) were shown to be the main symptoms, and about 20 to 14 percent of patients needed a ventilator.
By February 14 and by the time the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576, the mortality rate from COVID-19 was about 2%.
In comparison, the mortality rate of SARS up to November 2002 was about 10 percent of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
Based on a population study in June 2012, the mortality rate for MERS was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study previously showed that the R0 associated with SARS-CoV-2 reaches 6.47 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is between 5.71 and 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV by symptom, mortality rate and R0 is presented in Table 1.1..
The above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to outbreaks than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has a lower mortality rate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is therefore much more difficult than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Happiness often occurs in a family or from a gathering place or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Often two weeks before the onset of illness, patients have had a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas or contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it has been reported that individuals can remain virally transmitted for more than two weeks without symptoms, and patients who have recovered and are discharged from the hospital can also re-transmit the virus, a warning to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients is either normal or low.
For example, a condition of lymphonia with a white blood cell count of less than 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of less than 1×109/L, and an increased level of aspartate aminotransferase and virus presence in the blood were seen in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients were elevated and the reactive protein C and red blood cell absorption in the blood of most patients were elevated.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer D, which is the result of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The abnormality seen in radiographic images of the chest shell is seen in most COVID-19 patients and is characterized by the presence of two-sided shadows or a glass-matched curtain in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are present.
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and advanced fibrosis severely endanger the air exchange of the individual.
Type I and II dysfunction in pneumocytosis causes a decrease in the surfactant level and increased surface attraction, resulting in a decreased ability of the lungs to expand and an increased risk of pneumonia.
So the worse the radiographic findings of the chest shell are, the more severe the disease becomes.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed that the pollen deposits of pneumocytes, the formation of the lining of the glass membrane and the penetration of the benign lymphocyte and the semicellular lymph nodes in the lungs of the disease-due patient were compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to patients with SARS and MERS.
The RNA diagnosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 through reverse polymerase-roenoxy chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main diagnostic standard for COVID-19.
However, given the negative rate of false positives above this method, which may speed up the epidemic, on February 13, 2020 the use of clinical signs (other than those that rely solely on RT-PCR) for disease diagnosis began in China.
A similar situation had occurred for the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory screening and radiological findings is essential to an effective, necessary and mandatory diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group proposed a protocol using CRISPR-based Roshehai-based screening to identify SARS-CoV-2, which, based on the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-related RNA compound fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per macrolyliter of input cases) would be done using a tape in less than an hour without the need for expensive precise tools.
There is a possibility that a new method, if approved in clinical samples, could dramatically increase accuracy and ease of testing.
Given the lack of experience with this new type of CoV, doctors can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while various treatments used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases have been suggested (Table 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, anti-immune drugs, steroids, plasma discovery from patients who have improved, Chinese medicine and fluid support.
Even plasma detection from improved patients was recommended for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and is likely to have poorer attacks on other ACE2-containing organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
In addition, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the most important risk factors in the number of patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support for alleviating symptoms is vital and saves a person's life, which depending on the severity of the disease can include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilator and mechanical ventilator.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by bronchial mucosa oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiac bypass technique used to treat heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the functioning of vital organs is also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been determined that cytokine storm is caused by an over-reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
This cytokine causes immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals, which is the primary cause of ARDS and multi-organ narcolepsy.
Suppression of the immune system is essential in treating cytokine cycles, especially in patients with a debilitating condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other treatments for suppressing the immune system to prevent the cytocin storm include modulation of T-cell-directed immune response; inhibiting IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAK; Blinatomb; Sycopragm signaling cytokine 4 and inhibiting HDAC.
The steroid as an immune suppressant was widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
However, the use of the steroid in high doses in the event of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19 was not useful.
It may also cause severe side effects, especially a vascular stenosis, and significantly affect the recovery of the disease.
In addition, short-term use of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses is recommended, which should be used with caution for patients with COVID-19 who are in critical condition.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed for the disease.
However, it has been determined that intrusion into the vein of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, the possible suppression of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS, was identified by remdesivir.
On this basis, Gilead has sent the compound to China for a series of tests on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results were very promising.
In addition to baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms have been suggested.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
The plasma of patients was improved and the production of antibody plasma improved.
Blood from patients who have recovered from a chronic illness so that it can be used to treat other patients who suffer from a similar disease or protect healthy people from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood to combat the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign agents, and specific molecules in pathogens are detected and directly neutralized.
Based on this, blood plasma was collected from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, which was accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before specific therapies are offered, the use of this large-scale approach requires approval and transparency.
Moreover, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-exciter the immune response and induce cytokine-releasing syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxin.
The concentration of blood plasma in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma for the treatment of patients is very high.
It is difficult to produce and rapidly produce specific antibodies that are sufficient to fight a global epidemic.
Thus, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode the antibodies or screening the antibodies that are effective against the original viral proteins is more important and functional.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of proteins.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments in China.
However, the effects of the enzyme are largely dependent on the combination of different components in the formula, which varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on TCM theories.
Most of its effective components are still unknown or obscure, as it is difficult to extract and validate these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the most important treatments for patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rate of treatment in COVID-19 patients was observed in a few provinces of China, where 87 percent of patients used TCM, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent). In Hubei province, where only 30 percent of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the lowest rate of treatment was observed (13 percent).
However, this comparison is not entirely accurate, as many factors such as the number and severity of patients must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published an e-study for comparing Western therapy (WM) alone and combination therapy WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed to recover from body hemorrhage, disappear symptoms, and lie in bed was noticeably shorter in the group treated with WM+TCM than in the group treated with WM alone.
Most surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was lower (7.4% vs. 46.2%) than in the WM group and the mortality rate was lower (8.8% vs. 39%) in the WM+TCM group.
However, the efficiency and safety of TCM are still awaiting better controlled trials on larger scales and more centers.
Also, determining the mechanism of action and identifying the components of effective TCM treatment or their combinations if possible is a subject that has aroused the curiosity of scientists.
Suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 patients often have a high fear of the disease, which is very contagious and even fatal, and quarantined people also experience laziness, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in the body's tissues), nausea and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental distress.
In the first stage of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric disorders including severe depression, anxiety, neural attacks, paranoid-motivated emotions, paranoid symptoms, delusions and even suicide have been reported.
Forced contact tracing and quarantine, as part of a public health system approach to combating the spread of the COVID-19 virus, can make individuals less anxious about the effects of confinement, quarantine and stigma among family and friends.
Therefore, psychotherapy care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, individuals in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Fluid support should include the creation of fluid health teams from different disciplines, transparent communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact.
Effective vaccines are necessary to break the chain of transmission of infected populations and humans with ready hosts and are often used as a complementary method of antiviral treatment in the control of viral infections caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on protein S to produce strong, durable neutralizing antibodies or immunity against SARS-CoV.
Weakened live vaccines in animal models have been evaluated for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines in older adults and highly lethal models and their safety against common human-animal viral infections should be determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is probably because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, cases and clusters of MERS are still seen in the Middle East and, due to the presence of sources of animal-to-human transmission in indigenous areas, are spreading to other regions.
Vaccination monks for MERS using inactivated viruses, plasmids of DNA, viral carriers, nanoparticles, parasitic particles and subunits of the nootropic protein have been presented and some of them have been evaluated in animal models.
Producing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for vulnerable individuals is an essential and vital task for controlling the epidemic.
However, overcoming this challenge is difficult due to the long production time of the vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in the different varieties of CoV.
COVID-19 as a new disease, marking the full clinical cycle among thousands of newly diagnosed patients.
In most cases, patients will recover gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, the COVID-19 virus is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with acute cases.
Therefore, the creation of a model that predicts disease outbreaks is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize self-service, especially in areas with limited opportunities.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect the predictive flow of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: The most important predictor of SARS was the outbreak, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in people aged 30 to 65 years; a study of 8,866 people found that 47.4% of patients over 50 years of age.
Patients who needed special care were more likely to have underlying disorders and disorders and were older than those who did not need special care (mean age in the first group was 66 and median age in the second group was 51).This suggests that age is a predictor of the course of disease and determines outcome in patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Previous illnesses and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who needed special care were more likely to have acute heart failure and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the primary cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiosites, leading to liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly intertwined and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of reactive protein C in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and final recovery.
It has also been suggested that the correlation of CRP levels with severity and predictive COVID-19 disease outbreaks.
In addition to this, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
Enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released by tissue damage.
Therefore, as traditional symptoms, heart or liver disorders can be present.
Main symptoms of palenitis: For predicting the outcomes and complications of COVID-19, radiography of the chest and the timing of palenitis symptoms should be considered along with other issues.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immune system suppressants that are usually used as a treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in patients with SARS, many people recovered from vascular osteochondrosis with a disability of life and a declining quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used at low doses and for short term in COVID-19 patients.
Rural Stress: As explained above, since the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered from extreme stress, often because they are in long-term quarantine and have experienced severe insecurity and have witnessed the deaths of close family members and roommates.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover and relieve stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted so far, it seems that the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 differ from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 in addition to its proliferation in the lower respiratory tract can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and in the first stage of infection, have mild or minor symptoms and are similar to other CoVs that cause mild colds.
Thus, patients with first-stage or post-mortem illness can produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, which can make the control of the epidemic more difficult.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were severely ill and in the early stages of the disease, transmission did not occur.
Therefore, the outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and control is more difficult.
There are currently numerous efforts underway in China, including a ban on leaving homes in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of cutting off the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have severely damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the disease trend.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of the downward trend will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues, based a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic, believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be diagnosed in patients who had left the hospital two weeks earlier and recovered from a swallowing of the snout and throat, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be transformed into a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
Nevertheless, there have been promising signs in China based on the decline in new cases that suggest that existing strategies may be effective.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would cause one million deaths and half a million deaths.
However, through quarantine and intensive isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will become weaker in terms of pathogenicity and eventually become extinct or even a virus with a low pathogenicity that lives slowly in humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through vomiting or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus has also been found in the urine, which makes it possible to pass from the urine to the mouth.
In a new study of 138 cases, 41 percent of cases reported were from a hospital-acquired infection, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care professionals.
Therefore, extreme care should be taken to protect humans, especially health care personnel, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even transients who are in contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of contamination is to wear face masks; which can be through the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (series 1860), which help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the passage of droplets of fluid dispersed by potentially infected individuals through air or by gluing to the surface of the material where they can be transferred to others.
However, only N95 masks (1860 series) can protect an individual from the inhalation of 10 to 80 nanometers of viral particles, and only 5 percent of viral particles can pass through them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nanometers long.
Since particles can pass even through five surgical masks that are also placed on the rows, healthcare personnel who are in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series 1860), not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare staff must wear insulation goggles to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can infect an individual through the eyes as well.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor, wearing a N95 mask, was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus; the virus may have been transmitted through inflamed eyes or through the body.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also use transparent shields and lenses when working with patients.
For the general public in infected or potentially infected areas, it is highly recommended that people wash their hands with excessively disinfectant soaps and try to stay home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is considered to be a suitable distance for people who stay away from a patient.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 entered the world as a new virus, the high-level interaction with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, based on deep memories that the SARS outbreak in 2003 existed, was a significant warning to China.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control had expressed condolences to the citizens by stating that the infectiousness of the new virus is low and that transmission from person to person is limited and that there is no problem preventing or containing the disease.
This message significantly reduced public awareness of the danger, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to control the disease on a limited scale in Wuhan was lost.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned a hard lesson from this and make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more attentive, considering that every word spoken by health organizations is important to citizens and can change people's perceptions and decisions; (2) rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and authorities, be more sensitive and respond to them than the unusual information received from clinics; (3) rather than trying to persuade people, implement more restrictive measures to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages; and (4) to increase public awareness of pandemic disease and to periodically test and improve community response systems, issue more targeted and effective action guidelines.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was started by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus in late December 2019.
In less than two months and a half, the virus has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to know to control the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than young people.
SARS mortality was higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmitted the virus even when they had no symptoms, while patients with SARS transmitted the virus when they became seriously ill, which made the control of COVID-19 more severe than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread more and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA test in SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, treated patients can be infected with the virus again and their test result is positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain unresolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is about 96% genetic overlap between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
Which animal as an intermediary, the virus from the original host, such as bats, transmitted to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop transmission and the outbreak of disease can slow down at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical synthesis have determined that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent disease-dependent changes?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long does the outbreak continue?
During human-to-human transmission, how does a virus genetically mutate?
Will this disease become a worldwide epidemic, such as SARS, which will be eradicated or recurring in a periodic fashion, such as influenza?
The answers to the above questions are essential, but it may take some time to answer the above questions and many other questions.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The animal origin of the human coronavirus virus is human.
For thousands of years, adaptation and adaptation have led to the simultaneous evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human co-ovirus (HCoV) were known to cause mild illnesses such as colds.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has shown how devastating and dangerous HCoV infection can be.
SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019, the CoV was once again brought to the attention of the public and surprised Ma with its high self-esteem, but the symptoms of the disease were less pronounced compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common human-animal disease, and identifying the animal origin of HCoVs can be a good help.
Most HCoVs are caused by bats, which do not cause disease in their bodies.
Host cells that act as medium storage for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct effect on preventing disease in humans.
Studying the interactions of host CoVs in animals can also provide important insights into the human genome disease CoV.
In this review, we present a review of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
An important topic in which we compare different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genetic nootropics is the genetic code.
The current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (Covid-19) is being discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for successful host change and the evolution of the virus for disease severity are examined in this article.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of enveloped viruses, with a purity positive and a stringed RNA-like structure.
Viruses that have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobis between RNA viruses have been called "CoVs", which due to their crown-like morphology is under electron microscopy.
Structurally, CoVs have a uniform genome that shares a similar structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large-scale reading frame (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are converted into polyprotein replicases pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein is further processed and results in the production of 16 unstructured proteins, named nsp1 to 16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFHAST which is used for structural proteins such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproponin (N).
A number of side proteins that are specific ancestors have been encoded by different CoV ancestors.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genus includes most HCoVs and is divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as the source of their alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while birds are the primary repository of their gamma-CoV and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed species barriers, some of which have emerged as pathogens of great importance to humans.
To date, seven human cov (hcov) strains have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63R alpha-CoV.
Other beta-CoVs include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, the acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly pathogenic, causing infections of the respiratory tract in most patients and are likely to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and out-of-patient symptoms.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, called B814, was isolated from the nasal cavities of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, knowledge has been increased through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the widely accepted notion was that HCoV infection was generally harmless until SARS caused an outbreak.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS, one of the most devastating outbreaks of our time, infected more than 8,000 people and accounted for about 10 percent of the total deaths.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak caused an outbreak of a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to other parts of the world.
In 2019, the new HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was the cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic that killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The virus is becoming more and more endangered and the world must prepare itself for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Each week HCoVs have animal origins that include bats, mice or pets.
There is ample evidence that the evolutionary origins of all HCoVs are known from bats, in which viruses are well adapted, present without signs of disease, and exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created tremendous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, triggers and limiting factors of mutation of species.
This may also facilitate the search for a repository, medium host and animal host, enhancing SARS-CoV-2, and may have important implications for preventing future pandemics.
In this study, we will examine animal origin, interspecies transmission and the HCoV infection.
In particular, we highlight and discuss this common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs in the natural habitat themselves are not normally pathogenic, but after interspecies transmission to new hosts become pathogenic.
We also examine the evolutionary trend of HCoVs, where increasing viral spread is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The consequences of the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in this regard have also been discussed.
Animal cows have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814, from the nasal cavities of patients with mild colds, different CoVs were isolated in different animal species including buckwheat, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV detection in chronological order (Table 1) can be informative and well-informed.
In 1966, the first strain of HCoV-229E virus was sampled from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections and subsequently adapted for growth in the WI-38 lung cell culture.
Patients with HCoV-229E had symptoms of a common cold, including headache, thirst, weakness and sore throat, and fever and cough were seen in 10 to 20 percent of them.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory and gradually entered the brains of smaller mice.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those developed by HCoV-229 E, which are not detectable from the symptoms of other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229 and HCoV-OC43 are both globally distributed and are mainly transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the time of absence of N2 viruses is less than a week, and after that, the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild cold.
Only in a few immunocompromised patients, severe respiratory tract infections were observed.
SARS, also known as "pneumonic atypical" disease, is the first pandemic in human history to be caused by SARS-CoV and the third to be discovered by HCoV.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, and spread to many countries and continents.
Except for extreme cases, it is estimated that each case can infect about two others, with a four to seven-day period of inactivity and a peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and tremors, and then shortness of breath, coughing and breathing disturbances as later symptoms.
Lymphoblastic leukemia, liver failure testing and increased serotonin kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Widespread allele degradation, the proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophageal growth have also been observed in SARS patients.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients respectively needed special care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the respiratory system, multiple organs including the digestive system, liver and kidney were affected in acute cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be especially fatal in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first sampled during a pulmonary tissue biopsy in one of the patient's hospice units that had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, many efforts have been made to investigate HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from the Netherlands in late 2004 from a 7-month-old baby.
It was initially found that the disease is common in infants, elderly patients, and immunocompromised individuals with respiratory illnesses.
Fever, ulcer, fever and bronchitis are common in an HCoV-NL63 disease.
In another independent study, isolation of the same virus from a sample of an 8-month-old boy described from pneumonia in the Netherlands was reported.
Although the virus was identified in the Netherlands, it has spread globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7 percent of chronic respiratory diseases and peak outbreaks occur in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, also known as Crohn's disease.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma of an acute type.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 viruses are found worldwide and are a mild respiratory disease agent.
These four families, transmitted through society, are well adapted to humans and are generally less prone to severe diseases, although cases have occurred for unknown reasons, such as the recently reported rare strain, the malignant HCoV-NL63, which is caused by respiratory infections in China.
In general, when HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain continuous self-preservation in humans, the severity of virulence or disease propagation decreases.
MERS - CoV was isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and narcolepsy in Saudi Arabia.
While most confirmed cases of the laboratory virus originate from the Middle East, imported cases with secondary transmission due to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak in South Korea in 2015 was confirmed with 186 cases.
The emergence of MERS is similar to SARS, which is known as acute pulmonary syndrome.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffered from acute renal failure, which is a separate MERS among HCoV-related diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients had symptoms of diarrhea such as diarrhea and diarrhea.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases with a mortality rate of 34.4 percent have been reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid- to late December 2019, clusters of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infectious diseases were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has initiated an outbreak of respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and has declared a global public health emergency, dubbing the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 90,053, and the percentage of deaths was 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei China was 4.2% while abroad it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory infections that can be seen in the form of fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly turn into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the 82% homology above the nucleotide sequence, different branches are also clustered in phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to have fewer pathogens compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but is more transmissible.
Some reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 showed no signs that could contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six HCoVs reveals other similarities and significant differences.
The first is that the incubation period and the duration of the HCoV disease are also very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 is a relative of the overall trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is the mid-range SARS-CoV and four community-transmitted HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
A single SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are commonly seen in community-transmitted HCoV infections, including unusual, mild or even symptomless symptoms in some cases.
On the other hand, a small subset of acute COVID-19 cases can also be seen in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the rate of decline is lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 indicates interesting patterns of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs transmitted from society.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoVs transmitted from the community.
On the other hand, it must be confirmed whether the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after a few transmissions between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be diagnosed in samples of the vaccine.
Although transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the urethra or urine, such as SARS-CoV, plays an important role in transmission, at least in some cases, it should be clarified by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2, like community-transmitted HCoVs, may or may not be seasonal.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission capacity, disease propagation and sustained spread after transmission from individual to individual, will affect the ultimate fate of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
One in four HCoVs transmitted from society that cause mild symptoms of the disease has been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that caused severe human diseases and humans infected with severe HCoVs are now extinct.
To this end, HCoVs must be reproduced in humans sufficiently to allow the assembly of adaptive mutations that neutralize the host's limiting factors.
In this case, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people infected with the disease, the greater the chance of the virus being fully adapted to humans.
If the virus is well adapted, it will be difficult to prevent the transmission of the virus to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human communities, causing a mild cold in people with healthy immune systems.
These viruses do not require an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been adapted to humans and their transmission between humans cannot be stable.
These viruses need to be stored and spread in their animal stores and are looking for opportunities to infect human targets ready, which is likely to be done through one or more host mediums and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to those of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
Like HCoVs transmitted from the community, the virus has a high transmission capacity, at least for the present.
However, the incidence of HCoVs transmitted from the community is less and higher than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will have to wait and see if the virus is fully adapted to humans and transmitted between humans without a reserve intermediary or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, storage, intermediate and reproductive hosts of HCoVs.
If the animal's refuge is a near-viral ancestor with a high level of nucleotide sequence, that animal acts as the host of the evolutionary HCoV.
Ancestral viruses are usually well adapted to the host and are not pathogenic for the time being.
Similarly, a host provides a safe, continuous, and long-term shelter for HCoVs.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural host is HCoV or Dutch viruses.
On the other hand, if HCoV had a median host before infecting humans, or roughly the same time, it is well adapted to the new host and often pathogenic.
This host intermediate can act as a stockpile of animal infections in humans, and in the role of a multiplying host by providing the possibility of temporary viral replication and then transmission to humans, increases the level of infection in humans.
If HCoVs cannot maintain self-transmission in the host medium stable, they can cause deadly infections.
In contrast, HCoVs can adapt to medium-sized hosts and even have a long-term presence in the host group.
In this case, the medium host acts as a natural storage host.
Epidemiological data suggest that the first SARS infected person had a survey of game animals.
Subsequent investigations into the outbreak of the virus have shown that the levels of immunoglobulin G against SARS virus are higher in animal products vendors than in the general population.
For the first time, a number of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were diagnosed in the live animal market carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were almost identical to SARS-CoV.
A specific removal characteristic 29 - nucleotide for SARS-CoV in breeds taken at the beginning of a human epidemic has been found.
At the same time, it has been reported that palm-masked mushrooms were mostly negative due to the presence of SARS-CoV virus in forest dwellers or farms that were not offered live in the animal market. This suggests that palm-masked mushrooms are likely only a medium and reproductive host, not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, so the possibility that several species of small mammals may also act as medium-strengthening hosts for SARS-CoV can't be ignored.
All of these are apparently the ultimate hosts of SARS-CoV.
In a subsequent search for the unwanted natural animal host SARS-CoV, a type of coronavirus that was very similar to the bat CoV and called SARS-related coronavirus HKU3, the bat bat horse (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) was discovered that lived in the Chinese bat horse.
These bats are positive for the antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 sequence.
In the case of bats, the virus and other CoVs have a 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity to SARS-CoV.
These studies provided the basis for a new theory that bats host new viruses of human disease.
A number of coronavirus semi-SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none other than WIV1 have been able to isolate live viruses.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the SARS-CoV receptor has been identified.
WIV1 obtained from a bat's feces indicated that ACE2 was used in bats, seeds and humans as a receptor for entry into the cell.
Interestingly, patients with SARS who had recovered had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has been the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, with a 95% resemblance to nucleonide sequence.
Although there is considerable overlap between these two types of viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus is the immediate parent SARS-CoV and bats, the host host of the immediate SARS-CoV.
In phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is clustered with similar groups such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV from a similar host receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) are used to enter the virus.
RNA-associated RNA sequences of MERS-COV-associated RNA are closely related in terms of further pathogenesis to the beta-CoVs of bats identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat virus CoV-HKU25, are only 87 percent similar in nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the bat cannot immediately inhabit the host repository MERS-COV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the shrouds of a mountain are positive in terms of the specific neutralising antibodies MERS-CoV, a fact that is also true of the shrouds of the Middle East, which in the African country of the same name live in.
Live MERS-CoVs, similar to viruses found in humans, were sampled from the nose of a mountain shark and indicated that the shark is the true host repository of MERS-CoVs.
It is worth noting that symptoms are generally mild and very high in the virus in patients who were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the esophagus - the main method of transmitting the virus in bats.
However, one of the questions that has remained unanswered since then is that in many confirmed cases of MERS there was no history of contact with a shark before symptoms began, which is likely attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unknown animal species.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a 96.2% resemblance of the nucleotide sequence to the CoV RaTG13 virus, a bat separated from the bat's nasal cavity.
In cases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence of variations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for determining the parental relationship.
In other words, a bat cannot be the immediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus unless the bat's CoVs are produced in approximately the same way in the future.
Most likely, the animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which many early cases of COVID-19 have been observed, should be among wild animals sold and killed at the Hunanbu Seafood Market, indicating a possible transmission of the virus from animal to human.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of small, endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also be a refuge for the SARS-CoV-2-related ancestral beta-CoVs.
This new genetic species of the CoV pangolin virus has an 85 to 92 percent nucleotide sequence similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, viruses with about 90% nucleotide sequence similarity are as closely related to RaTG13.
The virus is clustered into two sub-viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-like contact range with SARS-CoV-2 and a 97.4% similar amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ more, though with a higher degree of similarity than the sequence across the genome.
In a previous study of patients with pangolinine, it was reported that from lung samples, fragments of viral DNA were isolated that were linked to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, various methods of sequencing and manual modification were used to create a portion of the genome sequence that constituted about 86.3% of the length of the virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at present there is no evidence that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is in pangolin because there is a link between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin mutation.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been determined.
While the greatest sequence of RBDs has been observed between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs related to beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence of genomes.
It is speculated that the high degree of similarity that exists between the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the evolution of homogeny by selective means.
A different proposal, however, advocates re-synthesis of beta-CoVs linked to SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and RaTG13 in a third wildlife species.
Nutrukibi as a catalyst for evolution is common among beta-CoVs.
Her judgments regarding the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been finalized.
Along with highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal origin HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also under study.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV - NL63 and HCoV - 229 may have been derived from bat-borne CoVs, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in the liver.
It has been reported that the .ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) bat CoV seen in North American bats has a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229 E is genetically related to another CoV bat called Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 19 / 2008 that was discovered in Ghana, while it is also suspected as a host medium virus.
To clarify the meaning, the available data on the animal origin of HCoVs, as identified in Figure 1 and Table 2, are summarized.
Felogenetic analysis has provided evidence for the transition of the HCoVs between species in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 spread between different animal species to infect humans through mosquitoes, a pandemic respiratory infection occurred.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Alpha-CoVs in bats that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them there is an alpha-CoV alpacae.
Multiple evidence supports the direct transmission of the virus by bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may be able to communicate with bats in a shared ecological environment.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alkabah.
Second, the bat alpha-CoVs associated with HCoV-229E in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while the alpha-CoV alpacae cause the spread of respiratory disease in animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpacae has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that Alpacaha has detected alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E in humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans including the herpes virus, Ebola virus, Nepa virus and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, while the alpha-CoVs of bats act as the treasure trove of the HCoV-229E gene, the alpacas and the shrimp of a mountain may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as was seen with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of the transition between bats and mountain camels and camels and humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was well documented from the very beginning when the virus was identified, and subsequent findings have reinforced this theory.
It is clear that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for the interchange of genetic fragments and inter-transmission.
Longevity, busy clones, close social interaction and a strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats that turn ORA into an ideal virus transmitter.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced under the guise of a coyote for decades.
The virus has adapted well to the environment and has evolved from a medium host to a stable, natural host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and in these animals, the rate of mutation is relatively low.
The transmission of the virus to humans is a random coincidence and humans are the host of the MERS-CoV virus, as transmission cannot be stable.
Compared to the role of the shterha in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolin, of course, if it does play a role in this case, is different in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Especially since pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
These animals may be hosted by beta-CoVs linked to SARS-CoV-2, similar to their sequence in SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for the transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 strain from animals to humans, which should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can be hosts of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Through butchery or coal mining, humans may have a common ecological status with bats.
Second, pangolin can be one of the two medium-boosting hosts in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced.
Human beings are infected with the virus through butchery and the consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The study of domestic and wild animals from the perspective of pests is essential.
Third, as mentioned above, nootropics and SARS-CoV-2 compatibility may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Besides the different types of animal hosts, three other factors on the viral side are also important to facilitate the passage of CoVs through existing barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication is.
The estimated variation in the rate of CoV virus, with a mean replacement rate, equivalent to approximately 10-4 replacements per year per site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of CoV to the new host, which, compared to other RNA-specific viruses, can be calculated as an average to a higher rate.
CoVs have an exoribonuclease correction error that removal can result in a very high mutation, inheritance or even failure to continue.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's analogue nucleotide is prevented from multiplying CoV by inhibiting the exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the promising agents against SARS-CoV-2 that should be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the CoV mutation rate is about one million times higher than their host.
In addition, the rate of change is high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, indicating a higher level of in-human compatibility.
Most likely, the virus has now been adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this topic is also valid for MERS-CoV, which is well-suited to a highly contagious disease.
In theory, it is unlikely that a genetic modification could quickly affect vaccines and antiviruses against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in their co-CoVs, provides additional flexibility in the modification of the genome for genetic and nootropic mutations, and as a result increases the likelihood of interspecies mutation, which under the right conditions will contribute to the emergence of new co-Vs.
This is supported by a high degree of single-readability frameworks and protein functions that are encoded toward the 3' end of the genome.
Second, CoVs are randomly and repeatedly modified in the RNA replication time by a unique "copy-selection" mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing repository, strand replacement occurs frequently during the run-up to the CoV RNA.
Subgenomic and highly homogeneous RNAs of high length can be reassembled to produce new CoVs.
In both HCoVs - HKU1 and HCoV - OC43 as well as animal co-viruses such as bat - CoV and batCoV - HKU9, phylogenetic evidence for natural nootropics has been produced.
Interaction between virus and host in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing the transition of the virus.
Here, the SARS-CoV nootropic is considered a minor sample, with evidence of positive selection during the interspecies transmission event.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated human samples and SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoVs in different hosts have rapid adaptation, especially by mutation in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD in the S-protein virus CoV interacts with the receptor cell and stimulates a severe antibody response of the host.
In the SARS-CoV virus, the amino acid 318-510 and the reagent S1 are present, which binds to human ACE2 and to the common receptor for viral infection.
RBD virus SARS - CoV is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, seals, mice and raccoons, which makes it possible to transmit the virus interchangeably.
In fact, it was observed that only the remaining 6 amino acids with viral samples taken from humans and the spleen in RBD differ, and 4 of the enzyme are located in the connective receptor motif for the interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV-2 strain has mutations K479N and S487T in RBD itself, which may increase the interaction of the mouse protein ra with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids may be essential for the viral compatibility with humans.
It is worth noting that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor has cell types similar to SARS-CoV.
The presence of a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in a single S1 protein S suggests that the tendency to bind protein S to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests that there is a 10-20-fold tendency for this transplants between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another common receptor is needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV - OC43.
These receptors may also be the explanation for successful adaptation of the human CoV after interspecific transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of the transposition of HCoVs between species is also controlled by other factors dependent on the host and limiter.
The interbreeding of host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as bats, mountain toads and jumping frogs may create an impediment to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission, HCoVs must be controlled by host dependent factors and host limiting factors eliminated by the cold.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction should be identified and identified.
The completely neutral screening of host dependence genomes and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
The origin of new HCoVs: from the beginning
The diversity of bats' CoVs has provided ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the CoVs of bats act as a repository of their HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic notrkbi also promote the evolutionary sequence of HCoVs and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new genes that encode proteins has the potential to severely alter virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV-like side proteins, it is thought that the ORF8 protein plays an important role in human compatibility, since after isolating the SARS-CoV-related bat virus, it was determined that the virus encodes different ORF8 proteins.
The removal of the nucleotide-29 virus SARS-CoV in isolated strains was observed at the beginning of a human epidemic.
In deletion, ORF8 divides ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that helps with host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible nootropic history with alpha and gamma co-CoVs, where a large number of smaller nootropic domains in RNA-associated RNA polymerases have been identified.
The Noterkebi mansions were identified in nsp9, the main part of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV virus, the pandemic agent, has experienced notably inter-agency events that have occurred throughout the Arabian Peninsula.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a nootropic event has also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs synthesize with other animal CoVs in non-self-structured genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genome, which are most likely caused by releasing viruses from the selective pressure applied, for example by the host immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of ORF4 in full length in the genome of the HCoV-229E prototype due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although the incomplete ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229 E-related viruses, alpha-CoV alpaca with a single additional nucleotide leads to a change in the framework.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also guided by selective pressure in their host stores.
No or mild symptoms were diagnosed when the bats were infected with their CoV, which indicates a mutual compatibility between CoV and the bat.
The bats seem to be anatomically and physiologically well adapted to their CoV.
For example, a lack of activation of the pre-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduces the damage caused by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the rearrangement of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor receptor and the low level of tissue compatibility of large complex molecules of class I.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by the metabolic activity of bats can both inhibit the proliferation of CoV and affect the review of the effects of exoribonuclease, thus providing selective pressure to produce highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is introduced.
The strains of CoV that are most pathogenic may be known to notherkybe, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics for host compatibility.
So it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and bats.
The viruses, without encountering a strong immune response from the host, proliferate vigorously.
Here is a mystery as to why pregnant women are seen without symptoms of illness and what causes severe conditions in human fever.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the intense functioning of the immune system and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune system response, the more severe the lung damage will be.
In contrast, in pregnant women without symptoms, the immune response to CoV replication is isolated.
The immune system response may have beneficial effects in treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.
The interferon signals in bats are particularly strong.
Therefore, the management of interferon type I, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be useful.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory enzyme in bats is defective.
With this reasoning, the inhibitor of the inflammatory enzyme NLRP3 along with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, from the general article of the event SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV follow.
While beta-CoV bats with SARS-CoV have 95% nucleotide-incompatibility, there is also a beta-CoV bat with 96% nucleotide-incompatibility with SARS-CoV-2.
While the identified stings and other animal market shelters were viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified.
Pancolin beta-CoVs, which are very similar to SARS-CoV-2, have been found and suggest that pancolin may act as one of the mediator hosts or pancolin beta-CoVs may assist with gene segments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is still no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally made by humans, although there are questions about this.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studying CoV in bats and other animals has radically changed our understanding of the importance of HCoV's animal origin and stockpiles in human transmission.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are caused by bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from human-to-sexual contact with the seeds in its market, planting a seafood market and killing the seeds could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same reasoning, pangolinhas should be removed from the marine animal market to prevent animal-to-human transmission, which is why several panolinhaste beta-CoVs have been discovered that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, clarifying how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from pangolins and other mammals to humans still requires further research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in the shadows of a mountain range.
The shroud is considered an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, lions, leather and pollen products for the local people.
The N-shatra has been widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the animals for the control of MERS, as was done in the Chinese wildlife market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the recurrence of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to produce effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for the same purpose, along with other pollution control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause an outbreak.
Some of the common human-animal co-VAs in wildlife are circulating.
In particular, the CoVs of bats with the potential to be transmitted from animal to human are highly diverse.
There are many opportunities for these human-animal co-viruses to grow and re-synthesize, leading to the emergence of new highly transmissible and deadly co-viruses.
The culture of wildlife eating in some regions of China must be eliminated to reduce unnecessary human-animal interaction.
With the rigorous testing that SARS, MERS and COVID-19 have had for us, we need to have a better plan for preparedness and response.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They remain in natural reserves until there is an opportunity to flourish.
Although bats have many characteristics that help spread viruses, if people are trained to avoid them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, and will be useful in preventing animal embryos from being introduced to humans and spreading to humans.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent human-animal communicable viruses is to keep humans away from the natural ecological reserves of human-animal communicable viruses.
Several pieces of the animal-origin puzzle SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been created.
First, if a bat has transmitted a virus ancestor SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolin, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolin could coexist in a common ecological location.
Second, if bats played a direct role in human transition, how did humans maintain contact with bats?
The third question is whether a third mammal actually acted as a mediator host, how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both care and experimental embedding must be performed.
Whether the targeted animal is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in the future in their natural hosts.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to maintain the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 for "suspicious resources" and "confirmed resources".
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a guide that provides insight into our experience and is a good reference for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, awareness and knowledge will gradually increase based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this article, we presented a perspective on our own guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious resources" and "confirmed resources" based on the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak of the disease, now officially named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), also known as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Our team has developed a quick guide to combating SARS-CoV-2 and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and knowledge of which will gradually increase based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of the monks are constantly being updated.
For example, guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been published a total of seven times, with some texts changed.
Now Zhou and colleagues have offered a perspective on our guide that includes a simple grading proposal based on their clinical experience.
Anha added new evidence to our guide and also provided a valuable reference for the worldwide pandemic.
We express our appreciation and appreciation for their outstanding work.
However, the article should be updated in accordance with the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh amendment (March 3, 2020), to confirm suspect cases, one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinically apparent symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if it lacks a history of pandemic disease, it must meet three clinically apparent symptoms:
Epidemiological history: (1) previous travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (2) previous contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test for nucleic acid); (3) previous contact with patients with TB or respiratory disease from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 were reported within 14 days of symptoms; (4) previous contact with confirmed clusters (more than 2 cases or respiratory symptoms within 2 days in small areas such as home, office, classroom, school, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (1) Smoke or respiratory symptoms; (2) images taken from a COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells representing a small number of elevated and decreased lymphocytes in the early stages of disease.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases must be based on suspicious cases accompanied by one of the following pathogens or serum evidence: 1) a blood PCR test to diagnose SARS-CoV-2; 2) a sequence of the entire virus genome that shows a high homogeneity with the new coronavirus; 3) a positive result in terms of specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody; or a change in the IgG antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase of more than 4 times the rate of infection in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see if the PCR blood-blinding test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic diagnostics were added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); and then ceramic evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes were made based on the continuous work of researchers who were looking for a kit of nucleic acid diagnostics optimized for rapid diagnosis, as well as on a respiratory sampling involving blood sampling that provided greater access to differentiated samples and supported the positiveness of specific antibodies at confirmed standards.
Moreover, there is more evidence to warn us to treat with caution patients with unusual symptoms and patients who lack symptoms.
Therefore, the chart of Zhou and colleagues should be updated, because in this Flow chart an individual without clinical symptoms is classified as "at low risk".
System recognition should also be confirmed in practice and through further clinical studies.
For the aggregate, we hope that more direct evidence will be presented and we ask readers to submit their own comments.
To diagnose "suspicious resources" and "confirmed resources", we suggest that doctors follow and follow the latest country guidelines.
Our team will also regularly update guides to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily deaths ever recorded.
Diroz, Bangladesh, has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 today.
These statistics, the highest number of deaths per day due to the virus, have been recorded.
The Diroz Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the recorded cases of infection, including 114 active cases and 33 recovering cases, rested at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said in an online press conference that in this statistic the death toll was four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two of the patients were over 60, two were between 50 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be in place.
A hospital employee told Anadolu News Agency that one of the deceased, Jalal Saiful Rahman, was a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission who was being cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, announced in an online video announcement that public transport will be closed until next Saturday, i.e. longer than originally planned.
The public transportation curfew was initially set to begin on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The shipment of basic goods - medical goods, fuel and food - continued.
The first case of COVID-19 reported in Bangladesh on 8 March was two passengers returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide.
Johns Hopkins University data shows that on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million cases.
At least 52,000 deaths are attributed to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
With the confirmation of the first case of coronavirus in Malawi and the first coronavirus-related death in Zambia, today has become a turning point.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases to date, with 79,332 of those reported as being related to the twenty-four hours before dawn Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported on the basis of Johns Hopkins University data that on Wednesday, more than 1,000 deaths were reported in the United States due to coronavirus infection.
Various countries around the world have taken more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow on Thursday, extended the city's holiday until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin announced that the rights and wages of the Russian people, without the need to be paid by the head of the Russian Federation, would be paid by April 30th throughout the country.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for another 15 days; the bill passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has imposed frequency restrictions in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina at all times of the day; previously, frequency restrictions were only enforced between the hours of 3pm and 6am.
Thailand has scheduled to implement a frequency restriction between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended home quarantine regulations until May 1.
Australian stores have reduced their share of toilet paper purchases for each purchase.
The Woolworths and Coles chain stores in Australia, on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, lowered the purchase limit on toilet paper in all state-owned stores by two and one pack for each purchase respectively.
ALDI Store also announced a restricted purchase of one e-package on Monday.
These restrictions are announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of the chain stores.
According to reports, shoppers are taking shopping and storage measures out of fear of needing quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited the purchase of toiletries for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were applied in addition to the previous four-package limitation for each purchase announced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles' store itself announced in a press release on March 8 that despite the purchase limit of four packages, "many existing stores will be sold out within an hour" and called this demand "unprecedented", ALDI's store also described it on its Facebook page on Tuesday as "unexpected".
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, sales in the past week experienced a "strong increase".
Like the Costco store in Canberra, last week it limited the amount of purchases allowed to two packages.
To reduce this shortage, Coles has recommended larger packages to suppliers and increased delivery times to stores, Woolworths has recommended more availability. ALDI has made available availability related to one of its special sale plans earlier Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retail Association, announced that retailers were trying to increase their presence, but local council restrictions on timing of freight trucks made it difficult to do so.
He said he expects production costs to increase as suppliers strive to meet demand and special sales decrease.
On Tuesday, ALDI Store announced that some stores, due to early availability of supply, will not be able to hold special sales on Wednesday.
Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a report to News.com.au that stores automatically fill up their existing warehouses every night.
He added that the size of the toilet paper leads to the fact that the existing store stock is small in terms of number and when the product is finished, it will empty up too much space in the shelves and create a sense of scarcity.
Russell Zimmerman at ABC News said that Coles and Woolworths believe that if there are too many products in the shelf, if there are too many products like toiletries and disinfectants and if there is a possibility to buy them, your fear will probably be minimized.
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of toilet paper recycling towels, announced last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex toilet towels, and Solaris Paper, which manufactures Sorbent toilet towels, have confirmed that they operate 24/7 in any case to meet demand.
Domain.com, one of the most active real estate sites, reported that when fewer auctions were held due to the long working day weekend closure of buyers, some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidders in Melbourne.
The Thursday edition of NT News, one of Darwin's newspapers, had a special eight-page letter to be cut and used as a toilet towel.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, these stores were originally unwilling to impose restrictions on purchases and announced that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a high demand for other goods, including masks, anti-inflammatory, dry goods, liquid and soap and cold.
Similarly outside Australia, the English online supermarket Ocado, on Sunday afternoon saw restrictions on the purchase of Andres toiletries for the amount of two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 - caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the outbreak of a disease, not the extent of its danger, WHO stresses the need to encourage governments to take countermeasures:
All countries can still change the duration of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, said that if countries have self-diagnosed, tested, treated, quarantined and tracked their population, they should prepare and prepare them.
We are deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of outbreaks and severity of the disease and by the alarming level of inadequate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former president of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: "Except for the flu, no other respiratory virus, from birth to the ongoing global outbreak, has been detected.
Ghebreyesus also said in a similar statement: "Before, we had never seen a pandemic that was caused by a coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a pandemic before that is controllable".
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency with international oversight.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on the outbreak of the disease, said: "The front-line situation is getting worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic 20-2019 is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) that is caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was declared a public health emergency with international oversight on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at around 4%, while globally it has fluctuated from 0.08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, nausea and shortness of breath.
Symptoms may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between the virus's entry into the body and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when urinating, distancing from other people, and monitoring and personal quarantine for people suspected of having the disease.
Countries around the world have responded to the virus by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, military rule, workplace risk control and lockdowns.
The pandemic has led to severe socio-economic disruptions, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of resources that are exacerbated by neural acquisitions.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have been closed nationally or locally, affecting 99.4% of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, as well as individuals from other areas where the virus is widespread, have been reported.
Due to travel restrictions and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health facilities in Wuhan, China (Hubei Province) reported a group of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and in early January 2020, an investigation into the matter was launched.
These cases were mainly related to the wholesale seafood market of Hvana, and therefore it is assumed that the virus has animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to the bat coronavirus, the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later determined that the first known person with symptoms was infected on December 1, 2019, and that the individual had no apparent connection to the next group related to the seafood market.
It was found that of the initial cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds had a connection to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that a case had been withdrawn on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province who may have been the first to catch the infection.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that despite reportedly decreasing cases in China, there were sudden increases in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China outnumbered the number of new cases inside China.
The number of reported cases may be significantly lower than in reality, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of the disease had been reported among young people, and individuals aged 19 and under accounted for only 2.4% of the cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, senior scientific adviser to the UK, estimated that about 60% of the UK population would need to be infected if collective immunity was to be effectively achieved.
In case of cases, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose testing has been declared positive based on official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had ever self-tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted a formal policy that only people with mild symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on March 16 revealed that as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been identified and these cases had not been recorded, accounting for 79% of the cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases of infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the number of base implants (R0) for COVID-19 were between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that this number could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death was between 6 and 41 days, and the most common period was 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were among people over 60 years of age and 70% of them had underlying diseases including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Official figures for the number of deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic generally indicate that their COVID testing, based on official protocols, was positive.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, as these figures may not include people who have died without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc..
Inadequate information from Italy showed that the number of untested deaths during the pandemic was about 5-4 times higher than official COVID death statistics.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said "we know that [declared deaths] are lower than the actual rate", including in line with informal reports of less statistical oversight in the U.S. Such measures often occur in pandemics, including the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and government territories on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, time elapsed from the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate as of April 10, 2020, is equal to 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated death rate dropped from 17.3% (for people whose symptoms began on January 10-11) to 0.7% (for those whose symptoms began after February 1, 2020).Other measurements include the CFR, which is the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease that indicates a mi-range, and the infant mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people who have a mi-range, which indicates a mi-range.
These statistics have no time limit and follow a particular population from the onset to the resolution of the case.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medical Center estimates that the overall mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
This maximum estimate is consistent with the results obtained from the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany as well as a statistical study that analyses the impact of the test on the CFR estimate.
WHO confirms that the pandemic is manageable.
As for the pack and the final duration of the outbreak, no definite comment can be made and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: "Common infectious diseases, if not controlled, usually stabilize and begin to decline once the disease is removed from available hosts.
But at the moment, it is impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, chief medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that if all countries mobilized to implement the recommendations of the World Health Organization on measures to combat the spread of the virus, "the disease could be eliminated by June".
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine announced on 17 March that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely be in circulation for a year or two".
According to research led by Neil Ferguson at the Royal College of Physicians, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is developed (probably 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated "I think the probability of the coronavirus disappearing completely is low - because it is easily transmissible" and "it is possible to turn into a seasonal disease that returns every year".
The intensity of this regression will depend on the mass immunity and the severity of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people with the disease may be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that are less common include fatigue, breast dysfunction, loss of sense of smell, breathing tightness, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, tremor, diarrhea, high blood pressure, diarrhea and sciatica.The World Health Organization has reported that one in six people will become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure in the chest cavity, sudden anxiety, difficulty waking up, tingling of the face and lips; if these symptoms occur, it is recommended that immediate medical attention be taken.
Some people with the disease may have no symptoms, no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm their infection, so researchers have recommended that people who have had close contact with people with the disease should be carefully monitored and tested to prevent their infection.
Estimates made by China of the rate of symptom-free individuals have varied from very low to 44% of the total.
As an example of uncertainty, the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell was initially 30% but later dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is thought that the disease is mainly transmitted through close contact and by small particles produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; and close contact means a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that uncoated surfing can spread small particles between 4.5 metres (15 ft) and 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some research has suggested that the virus can be transmitted by small particles produced by speech and for longer periods in airborne air.Though the virus is not generally airborne, tiny breathing particles can be produced by breathing, including handwriting.
These particles can be placed in the mouth or nose of people near the ground or can be transferred through their breathing, through their lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as respiratory tubing and cardiac reverse resuscitation (CPR) can lead to airborne respiratory filtration and, as a result, the spread of airborne disease.
It is also transmitted when a person touches an infected surface, including skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of transmission of disease through the pulse, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of a dental-pathogenic transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Although there is also the possibility of pre- and subsequent transmission of symptoms, the highest incidence of infection is within the first three days of symptoms.
People whose test results were positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared suggest that transmission of the disease is possible before significant symptoms occur.
There are few reports of symptom-free cases that have been confirmed by the laboratory, but symptom-free transmission during the investigation of communication tracing has been identified by some countries.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has stated that although the exact rate of rapid spread of the disease is not fully known, usually one infected person can infect two or three other people.
In particular, it has been determined that the virus survives for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304 surfaces, for up to one day on a casing and for up to four hours on copper.
However, these values can vary depending on humidity and temperature. So far, cases of positive testing for COVID-19 on pets and other animals have occurred.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however English authorities recommend that people wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as in cases where they touch other surfaces that may have been touched by infected people.
Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was first identified from three people with pneumonia who had contact with a group of people with acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in naturally occurring related coronaviruses.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that dissolves its protective coating.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought that the virus has animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the beta-corona virus, a subgenus of the sarcophagus virus (gen B) along with two genes derived from bats.
The virus at the genome level corresponds 96 times to other bat coronavirus specimens (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that between the pangolin and human viruses, there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of their genome sequence.
A complete genome comparison to date has concluded that a maximum of 92% of the genetic material between coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is common, which is not enough to prove that pangolin hosts are mediators.
Infection with the virus can be diagnosed temporarily through symptoms, however, final confirmation is made through chain reaction polymerase chain reaction reverse reaction (rRT-PCR) infection filters or CT imaging.
A researcher comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific since many of the imaging characteristics of CT are synonymous with other inflammatory diseases and related diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening tool or a preliminary test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has released several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
This test uses the reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) momentum.
This test is performed on breathing and blood samples that can be performed.
The results of these tests are usually specified within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is performed with a swab of the neuropharynx, however, a swab of the glue can also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that diagnose antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these methods were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex for emergency use has only been approved by certain reputable laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging in radiography and computed tomography (CT) people with symptoms include unevenly sized glass parameters and the absence of scales.
The Italian Radiological Association is compiling an international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases of the disease.
Photography without PCR approval, due to its similarity to other infections such as adenovirus, cannot be used specifically to diagnose COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT chest scans with PCR and showed that although less imaging is specifically usable to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive and suggested that it be used as a screening tool in pandemic areas.
Synthetic neural networks based on AI have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus by both radiography and CT.
Some methods to prevent transmission include proper personal hygiene, washing hands, touching the eyes, nose or mouth with handshake, and taking towels when coughing or sneezing and throwing towels directly into garbage cans.
Those who have already been affected by the disease are advised to wear surgical masks in public settings.
Many states have banned or recommended that unnecessary travel to countries or regions where the disease is prevalent be avoided.
However, in many parts of the world, the virus has reached a social outbreak.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and some people do not know where or how they have been infected. People who provide health care to potential patients are advised to take standard precautions, follow contact precautions and use eye protection.
The use of mobile location information by governments for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to limit this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps are created or proposed until they are used voluntarily, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are looking for solutions that do not violate privacy, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Then, if users are in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19, they receive a message.Some misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are spreading; for example, squeezing the nose or a toothbrush with a toothbrush are not effective ways.
Although many organizations are working on developing a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
To prevent the spread of the disease, a shed hand is recommended.
The CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after toilets or when hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after emptying their noses, throats, or throats.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with household soap, which can kill the protective bubbles.
The CDC also recommends that alcohol-based disinfectants with a minimum alcohol content of 60% be used in situations where soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with their hands.
It is possible to remove contamination from surfaces by various methods (one minute of exposure to an anti-inflammatory material for the steel surface anti-corrosion), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% betanin.
Other methods, including benzodiazepine chloride and chlorhexidine gluconates, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in the event of a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a building such as a work office or day care center, all sections such as offices, health services, shared areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboard, remote controls and automated teller machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations have recommended that people who cough or sneezed, put on their own lipstick or towels and throw the towel away immediately.
For people who are likely to be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the size and distance of particulate matter that is scattered when speaking, thirsting or vomiting.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce people's desire to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection if proper hand hygiene is not observed".
The World Health Organization recommends wearing a mask by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those caring for people with COVID-19, however, they also confirm that wearing a mask helps people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun encouraging members of the community to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends that non-medical masks made of fabric be used.China specifically recommends the use of medical masks once consumed by healthy community members, especially when in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended that surgical masks be used when using public transport or stopping in crowded places.
Thai health facilities encourage people to wear fabric, make masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out and attending meetings without wearing a mask or covering their mouths and noses.
On March 16, Vietnam urged all citizens to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has made wearing a mask mandatory for those who visit grocery stores.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear masks when attending a meeting.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, has forced passengers on inter-city trains and buses to wear masks since April 1.
Panama has made wearing a mask compulsory when going out and has recommended that those who cannot buy a mask make their own homemade mask.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes pollution control measures that are aimed at slowing down the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
These practices include quarantine; travel restrictions; school and car lounges, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls closed.
Individuals can implement these practices by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, keeping in touch and keeping physical distance from others.
Currently, many governments in areas where the disease is prevalent have enforced or recommended social distancing.
The maximum number of people recommended to gather by U.S. government agencies and health organizations, quickly dropped from 250 (if there was no outbreak of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with secondary diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure and immune deficiency are at higher risk of contracting and experiencing severe complications, and the CDC has recommended that such individuals stay at home as much as possible in areas where the disease has spread in the community.
Using the term "social distancing" instead of encouraging people to maintain communication using alternative methods, however, the concept implied that individuals should enter complete social isolation.Some officials issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic.
These guidelines included recommendations that you only have sex with someone you live with, someone who is not infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
For people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected, quarantine at home is recommended.
Many states have mandated or recommended quarantine for all people living in areas affected by the virus.
The strictest personal quarantine guidelines have been issued for those in risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the disease has spread widely are advised to observe a 14-day quarantine from the time of last contact.
Strategies to control the spread of a disease include containment, suppression and mitigation.
Mahar is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and with the aim of deterring and isolating infected individuals as well as introducing other measures for disease control and vaccination to stop the outbreak to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of disease, efforts are shifted towards a mitigation strategy: measures are taken to reduce the incidence and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
I can implement a combination of measures related to skill and reduction at the same time.
Repressing more severe measures to counteract the pandemic by reducing the number of base implants to less than 1 requires.As part of managing the outbreak of an infectious disease, efforts to reduce the pandemic pack are known as clearing the pandemic curve.
This, in turn, reduces the risk of over-stressing healthcare and provides more time for the production and development of vaccines and therapies.
Non-drug interventions that can help manage the spread of the disease include personal preventive measures including hand hygiene, wearing a mask, personal quarantine; social measures aimed at physical distancing including closing schools and cancelling events where there is a high concentration of people; social participation to encourage acceptance and compliance with these interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also implemented a series of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented a group of strangulation and local quarantine and issued warnings on the relocation of affected people.
Singapore has considered financial support for self-quarantine beginners and imposed severe penalties for those who fail to do so.
Simulations conducted for Britain and the United States show that the strategy of mitigating (restraining the spread of the pandemic and not stopping it) and suppressing (reversing the growth of the pandemic) face major challenges.
Optimal policies to reduce the demand for health care can reduce the demand for health care by two-thirds and the mortality rate by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and put excessive pressure on the health system.
Repression could be a better strategy, but it should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), because if measures are abandoned, the infection rate will quickly return to the previous level.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic, resulting in social and economic costs.
There is no confirmed antiviral drug for COVID-19, of course, efforts are underway to develop it, including testing of existing drugs.
Using prescription medications for a cold, drinking fluids, and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, vein-injected fluids, and respiratory aids may be needed.
Using a steroid can slow things down.
Several synthetics that have already been approved for treating other viral diseases are being studied to see if they are useful for treating COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also announced "a few traditional and home remedies" that can help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described capacity building and adaptation of the health system to the needs of COVID-19 patients as one of the key measures to combat the spread of the disease.
The ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources to different levels, including focusing on laboratory services on testing for COVID-19, cancelling unnecessary surgeries where possible, isolating and isolating patients with COVID-19, and increasing the capacity of special care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and available beds.
There are differing opinions as to where the first case (called patient zero) originated.
The first case of the new coronavirus may be returned on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these people were associated with the wholesale market of Hwana seafood, which sold both live animals and mai, and one theory is that the virus originated from a species of these animals; that is, the virus has animal origin.A group of people with pneumonia with an unknown cause were observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hoban Hospitals, who reported the subject to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police advised eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to refrain from spreading false rumors, and another doctor named Ai Fen was punished by the supernatural for providing these warnings.
Later, the Wuhan City Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and reported the matter to the World Health Organization.
A large number of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause were reported to Wuhan health centres, prompting research into the field to begin in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases, almost every seven and a half days, doubled.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transferred to other provinces of China to help travelers related to the Chinese New Year and given that Wuhan is one of the main transport hubs and the main hubs of the rally exchange.
On January 20, 2020, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including one in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States with the highest confirmed cases in the world was preceded by China and Italy.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and 364,000 recovered.
Within the borders of 200 countries and governmental territories, at least one case has been reported.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted free movement and started border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of disease, including quarantine (known as a stay-at-home, asylum or home quarantine order) and the military government.As of April 2, about 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of home quarantine, in the Philippines, more than 50 million people, in South Korea about 59 million people, and in India about 1.3 billion people were under home quarantine.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.

On December 31, a public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission.
The World Health Organization was informed of the matter on the same day.
With the announcement of the news, the police warned Wuhan doctors about a "rumored split" in the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a basic campaign called "Warring People" to curb the spread of the virus, which was later described by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
In what has since been called "the largest quarantine in human history", a health belt was identified on January 23 to stop people entering and leaving Wuhan, a topic that spread to 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been canceled in many places.
Officials also announced that a temporary hospital called Huoshenshan Hospital will be built within 10 days.
Afterwards, another hospital called Leishenshan Hospital was built to care for more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China converted 14 other buildings in Wuhan, including convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government launched other measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including health declarations for travelers and increased spring break holidays.

On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the prevention of domestic transmission of the disease was taken seriously and the outbreak in China was controlled.
On the same day, two months after the quarantine, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except for the city of Wuhan.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that entry into the country for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended after March 28, and did not provide any details on when the implementation of this policy would end.
Those who want to enter China will be required to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provided incentive packages for companies.The State Council announced that on April 4, which coincides with the Day of the Pilgrims, there will be public mourning and a three-minute silence will begin at the country level at 10:00 a.m. However, the central government asked families to respect online behaviour in order to maintain physical distance and to prevent the re-emergence of COVID-19.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had been transmitted through China to South Korea.
The country's health department reported on February 20 a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly related to a Daegu riot involving a new religious movement called the Church of Christ.
It was thought that Shincheonji disciples who had come from Wuhan to Daegu were the source of the outbreak.
From February 22 to February 9, 9336 in the church, the presence of symptoms was reported in 1,261 people, or about 13% of them.

The screening methods include compulsory self-reporting of symptoms for newly arrived international travellers via mobile app, test centers that can be entered by car and the results are specified the next day, and an increase in the testing capacity by 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program, despite its city-wide quarantine, is considered one of the most successful in controlling the outbreak.The South Korean community was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.

On January 23, Gauden Galea, a World Health Organization representative in response to the decision of the central authorities to ban transport in Wuhan, said: While this decision "is not in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organization", it "is a very important sign of commitment to contain the pandemic in a region where the disease is most concentrated" and it was called "an unprecedented decision in the history of public health".On January 30, after confirming the transmission of human-to-human disease outside China and increasing numbers in other countries, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency with international concern (PHEIC) that Shenzhen PHEIC had been in since the first declaration of the situation in 2009 in the case of the Cholera pandemic.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the PHEIC was announced because of "the risk of a global outbreak of disease, especially in low- and middle-income countries lacking a robust health system".
In response to travel restrictions, Tedros said "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and "the World Health Organization does not recommend restricting trade and movement".

A number of senior officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired due to the mismanagement of quarantine in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the way the political establishment is coping with the outbreak in these regions.
Some analysts believe that this move is intended to keep Xi Jinping, the chairman of the Communist Party of China, safe from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, including Zhao Lijian, have denied their previous confirmation of the coronavirus outbreak originating from Wuhan and have raised conspiracy theories about whether COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and declared that "China's censorship has exacerbated the virus and transformed it into a global pandemic", statements that in turn were criticized by some critics as racism and "a policy to deflect public opinion from the failure of its government to control the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained some U.S. government information that described a media ploy that clearly originated with the National Security Council and from this strategy, titled "Everything is related to China".
We were told to try and convey the message using every possible means, including a press conference and a television presence. "Media outlets including Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries where the virus has spread are part of the propaganda push to influence the world.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, warned that "there is a geopolitical composition that involves the quest for influence through the circulation of news and the politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China wants to convey with great enthusiasm the message that, unlike the United States, a partner is responsible and reliable".

In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of cooperation with Italy, which had suffered the most negative impacts from the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the EU, said: "China alone has responded.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity".
On March 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, sent the Russian military a decree of military medicines, special anti-depressant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
La Stampa Italy reported that an unnamed "high-level political source" said that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
This source also accused Russia of initiating a "geopolitical and diplomatic" manifestation.
Attilio Fontana, Lombardy's president, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, rejected the media report and expressed their appreciation for the aid.
Russia also sent a cargo plane containing medical aid to the United States.
Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said "Putin, when sending aid to American partners, believes that once American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment are strengthened and moving in the right direction, if necessary, they will be able to compensate for this move".
The NATO-planned military campaign "Defender 2020" will be held in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, which are NATO's largest military campaign since the end of the Cold War, on a more limited scale.
Kate Hudson, secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticized the Defender 2020 campaign, saying that "in the current public health crisis, the campaign not only puts the lives of US soldiers and many European participating countries at risk, but also the lives of the citizens of the countries where the campaign is being held".
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran wrote a general letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, stating that due to the lack of access to global markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran, the country is seeking to combat the outbreak of the disease, requesting assistance.The outbreak has led to requests for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, some of which include universal health care, universal childcare, entitlement allowance for families and higher levels of public health budget.
Political analysts have predicted that the disease could adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
After Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at locations designated by the state, South Korea criticized "Japan's vague and passive search for quarantine".
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to blame Moon for what they called the mismanagement of the government, and some others encouraged his reaction.This pandemic allowed countries to adopt emergency laws in response.
Some analysts have expressed concern that the disease could allow governments to further exert their power.
The Hungarian parliament allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to allow an unlimited number of people to legislate, suspend parliament and elections, and punish those who seem to have spread false information about the virus and how the state managed the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been attributed to several cases of shortage of resources due to increased use of equipment to combat the outbreak, neural acquisitions and disruption of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several shops have also witnessed nerve buying, which has led to shelves being emptied of essential items such as food, toiletries and mined water, and a sense of scarcity of resources is felt.
In particular, the tech industry has warned of its delay in transporting electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, director of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has been matched by 100.
This demand has led to prices rising to twenty times the normal price, causing a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical goods.
It has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and the World Health Organization has warned that this would put healthcare workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
This activity has led to a shortage of milk in some supermarkets and subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both regions have been left with severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat monopolies and the illegal buying and selling of basic products have been successful and have prevented the severe food shortage that was predicted in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with a significant agricultural output, has not experienced severe shortages, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
In Wuhan, only occasionally were food shelves emptied and Chinese government facilities even marketed pork stocks to satisfy the people with adequate nutrition.
Similar rules exist in Italy that require food producers to have inventory for such emergencies.
The global economy has been damaged in China: according to media reports on March 16, China's economy suffered a severe blow in the first two months of 2020, due to government measures to reduce the spread of the virus and drastically reduce retail sales by 20.5%.
As mainland China is one of the world's major economies and a major producer, the outbreak of the virus is considered an important destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais has predicted from one economist's report that until a clearer picture of the possible consequences of the current situation is established, markets will remain unstable.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the negative economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could be greater than the consequences of the SARS outbreak in 2004-2002.
One of the experts at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the negative impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain could last up to two years.
According to reports, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is "shrinking" after the sharp drop in oil prices due to declining demand from China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to heightened concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock market indices including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced their most severe auto-fall since 2008, when the Dow fell 1191 units, the largest single-day drop since the economic crisis of 2008-2007.
All three indices ended the week with a decrease of more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH, confirmed China's top credit rating but maintained its negative outlook.
The stock markets collapsed again due to fears of the coronavirus, with the biggest fall occurring on March 16.
Many, however, consider a recession to be possible.
Mohamed El-Erian, an economist, praised the emergency measures and, on occasion, the central banks and governments.
Central banks, compared to the 2008 financial crisis, are reacting more quickly.
Due to travel bans, public holidays including tourist attractions, and government recommendations to abstain from any travel around the world, tourism is one of the sectors most affected.
As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas have cancelled self-service flights due to reduced demand and the Flybe regional airline in the UK has been shut down.
The negative effects of the virus on the cruise ship industry have been unprecedented.
Several train stations and boat ports were also closed.
The pandemic, with Chunyun, one of the main travel seasons associated with Chinese New Year holidays, coincided.
A number of events, including New Year's festivals, which attracted large crowds, were cancelled by national or regional governments and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai permanently closed their stores and tourist attractions.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibits were closed to avoid crowds.
In 24 cases in 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, New Year's holidays were extended until February 10, and most workplaces were ordered not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has raised its infectious disease response to a high level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and canceled New Year's celebrations.
Retail sales in Europe and Latin America declined by up to 40%.
Retail stores in North America and the Middle East saw a 60-50% drop in reviews.
The outbreak also led to a 43-33% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America's estimates, the recession caused by the pandemic could cause 14 to 22 million people in Latin America to live in extreme poverty, which would not have been possible without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large portion of the population of about 300 million people are rural migrant workers, who have been left in their homes in the interior provinces or in the Hoby-Gare province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government grants.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' forecasts, the coronavirus outbreak could damage 47 million jobs in the United States and increase unemployment rates by up to 32%. India's lockdowns have caused unemployment for millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid daily wages). A survey by the Angus Reid Foundation found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. In Spain, since the closure of businesses in mid-March 2020, about 900,000 self-employed workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million English workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany, self-employed workers, submitted short-term government-subsidized work plans known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation scheme has also been implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been deeply affected by the pandemic, with operations and the human resources of related organizations - both employed and self-employed - being affected worldwide.
Organizations active in the field of culture and art have endeavored to continue their self-imposed mission (which is often funded by government funding) of ensuring community access to cultural heritage, maintaining the safety of their employees and supporting artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition halls and other cultural institutions around the world, to varying degrees, were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and exhibitions were cancelled or postponed.
One of the other consequences of this recently accelerating disease is the cancellation of religious ceremonies, important sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the Holy Week processions in Rome, which are held during the last week of Lent and Penance, have been canceled.
Many bishops have recommended that older Christians stay home instead of attending the Lord's Supper on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live online or television, and others have made it possible to attend car-based services.
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Rome has closed its own churches and monasteries and St. Peter's Square has been emptied of Christian visitors, other religious institutions have also abolished their own services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and the harems were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign visitors as well as its residents from entering the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the greatest disruption to the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most important sporting events, including the Europa League 20-2019, the Europa League 20-2019, the Europa League 20-2019, the Euro 2020, the NBA 20-2019 and NHL 20-2019 seasons have either been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak has made the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start at the end of July, more difficult; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be re-scheduled for a historic period beyond 2020, with a maximum of summer 2021".Casinos and other gaming centers around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have either been canceled or postponed.
This has led many gamblers to visit online sites, many gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their own registrations. The entertainment industry has also been hit, and many bands have self-suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, including Broadway, have suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing artwork via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, including live concerts or creating web-based "holidays" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their own works.
In the online space, many internet memes with coronavirus themes have been circulated so that many of them deal with various jokes and issues amidst the uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in discrimination, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people who are in the disease canon in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, cases of fear, suspicion and hostile behavior have been observed.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) showed racial sentiment in various groups around the world about whether Chinese people are worthy of the virus or are suffering from torture.
Some countries in Africa have also seen rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese people, both online and offline, from those in the affected areas.
After the spread of the disease to other countries, the people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, were also subjected to suspicion and foreign fear.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan# has been trending on Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians in the UK and US, reported an increase in racial slurs and attacks on self.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for naming the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term that was racist and anti-Chinese in the eyes of critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian nationals and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan and were on their way to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students who were from northeastern India, which shares a border with China and were studying in India's main cities, experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, declared that the Chinese have destroyed nature and "for this reason, God has taken vengeance on them".
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta and dubbed "narcissistic".In China, the pandemic, foreign terror and racism against non-Chinese residents were ignited and foreigners were called "foreign occupation" and targeted for "throwing out".
Many newspapers with subscription fees have removed all or part of the coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak freely available.
Some scientists quickly shared the results on servers of pre-published versions such as bioRxiv.

The respiratory disease test for the 2019 coronavirus (Covid-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus, including methods for diagnosing the presence of viruses and antibodies produced in response to the infection, will be conducted.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR that RNA detects the coronavirus.
This is a specialized test and only the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 is diagnosed.
These tests are used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibiotic diagnostics (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
The test showed that, taking into account people who had very mild symptoms and reported no or no symptoms at all, how many people were affected by the disease.
Using the results of these tests, the accurate mortality rate and collective immunity levels in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the disease in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable differences in the number of tests performed between countries.
This difference is likely to affect the significant extent of reported mortality, which is likely to be overestimated in some countries.
This experiment, which uses a reverse-chain polymerase-containing-reaction (rRT-PCR) momentum, can be performed on breathing samples taken in various ways, including swab nasopharynx or mixed sample.
The results of these tests are usually specified within a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests, which are performed with a swab of glue, only provide reliable results in the first week of illness.
After that, the virus can disappear from the glue, while it is replicating in the lungs.
For infected individuals tested in the second week, alternative samples can be taken by catheter suction from deep airway breathing or there is also the possibility of using the material from the vomiting.
One of the first PCR test samples was developed in January 2020 at Charité in Berlin using the reverse chain reaction polymerase-containing resin (rRT-PCR) instantaneously, forming the basis of 250,000 kits of tests distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Kogenebiotech from South Korea on January 28, 2020, developed a PCR-based clinical diagnostic kit SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus England).
In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization for PCR-based diagnostic kit SARS-CoV-2 from the National Organization for Chinese Medical Products.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing the RT-PCR diagnostic panel for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 2019 (2019-nCoV) among public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the kit due to defective identifiers and testing limitations at the CDC in Atlanta resulted in inconclusive results; this subject led to the successful processing of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout February.
Until February 28, 2020, the two-part test was not reliably diagnosed, and it was after that that state and local labs issued testing permits.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, under emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began conducting the test in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing is available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also similarly made the COVID-19 testing available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No limitations on the number of tests have been announced; sampling and processing must be done in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the production and development kit for testing COVID-19 was carried out by the country's centre for virology and biotechnology research VECTOR.
On March 12, 2020, it was reported that the Mayo Clinic had invented a test for COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours at high volume, allowing one device to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received similarly approved U.S. approval for a 45-minute trial from the FDA.
FDA has approved a trial that uses isothermal nucleic acid reinforcement instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of alternating thermal cycles, this method can produce a positive result in only five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
Currently, about 18,000 of these devices are available in the United States, and Abbott expects that with increased production it will be able to deliver 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the new coronavirus nucleocycloid protein (protein N) is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to be as accurate as a rapid flu test, yielding results in a 15- to 20-minute container.
A study conducted in March 2020 concluded that "radiographic images of the chest shell have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computing tomography] findings can be determined even before symptoms appear".
Typical features of CT include a double-sided multi-lobed glass matte with lateral, uneven and rear-facing distribution.
As the disease progresses, substrate overload, deformed coating and stiffening occur.
A researcher who compares PCR to CT in Wuhan, which is the current pandemic principle, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR and at the same time less specific since many of the imaging characteristics of CT are synonymous with other inflammatory diseases and disease outcomes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a screening tool or as a preliminary test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".As of March 2020, the CDC recommends the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune system's response to this infection is to produce antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to diagnose infection in individuals after 7 days or more of symptoms, to diagnose immunity and to monitor population.These tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through a patient-patient clinical trial (PoCT).
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the level of production of each system.
For CLT, usually one sample of ambient blood is used, although to track the immune system response, it is possible to use multiple pipeline samples.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken by skin piercing.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 agencies that had reported to the organization as requested and were therefore now able to distribute the antibody tests themselves.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, the medical diagnostic laboratory Euroimmun and Epitope Diagnostics, obtained European approval for their own test kits.The kit was able to identify IgG and IgA antibodies that were filtered against the virus and were present in a blood sample.
The test capacity of several hundred samples is within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the standard PCR test for identifying viral RNA.
These pests are usually diagnosed 14 days after the onset of disease.In early April, England noticed that none of the test kits for pests it had purchased were adequately used.
Hong Kong has implemented a scheme whereby suspect patients can stay at home, "the emergency room will give the patient a sample tube", the patient will inject a spray of the sample in an on-meal and then return it and receive the test result some time later.The NHS UK has announced that while it is implementing a pilot scheme to test suspect cases at home, the risk of infecting others is eliminated if the patient is hospitalized as well as using an ambulance and an anti-inflammatory device if necessary.In centres where the entry of suspect cases of COVID-19 is provided by car, a healthcare professional will take measures to collect samples, taking appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Physicians for Compulsory Health Insurance announced on March 2 that it has a capacity of 12,000 tests per day on a planetary scale and a week earlier, 10,700 people had been tested.
If the test is prescribed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Köh Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
From March 19, the possibility of testing a car in several major cities is provided.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not known as only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that by the week of 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested by the end of week 12/2020 and a result of 33,491 samples (6.9%) had been positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested a method to test 64 patient samples simultaneously, they have combined samples and then conducted further tests only if the result of the combination sample was positive.In Wuhan, on 5 February 2020, a temporary emergency diagnostic laboratory with an area of 2000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼 or "fire-shaped") was opened by BGI with a processing capacity of 10,000 samples per day.
The five-day laboratory, built and monitored by BGI founder Wang Jian, showed that if the test capacity was not put into operation, the number of cases in Wuhan would be 47% higher and the costs associated with quarantine would be doubled.
Similar samples from Wuhan Laboratory, called Huo-Yan Laboratories, were immediately launched in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
The open-source and composite designs released by Origami Tests can test 1,122 patient samples using just 93 kits of COVID-19 testing. These balanced designs are feasible in small labs without the need for robotic fluid examiners.
By March, the shortage and lack of adequate IDs had been turned into a barrier to testing for the bulk in Europe, the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that include heating samples to 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to free up the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March, it was announced that the UAE is now testing a large number of the country's population for the coronavirus, which is higher than that of any other country and is thus making a successful test for the availability of a large part of the country's population.
This was made possible by the ability to test with cars and the purchase of a large laboratory on the scale of the country's total population from Group 42 and BGI (based on the Huo-Yan Emergency Diagnostic Laboratories in China).
The lab, which was built in 14 days, is capable of performing a thousand RT-PCR tests a day and is the first such scale lab to operate outside China.
Different test protocols targeting different segments of the coronavirus genetic specification were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German guidelines to prepare and ship kits to low-income countries that lacked the resources to produce domestic kits.
German test kits were released on January 17, 2020. Since the protocol prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, the delay in starting tests in the U.S. caused delays. China and the U.S. had trouble with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries, along with Australia, could not provide enough kitts to meet demand and items recommended by health professionals for testing.
Experts say that the availability of extensive testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity to conduct tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, has been built over the past few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for a stronger testing program as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic.Overdemand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States to be delayed and the presence of pathogens and chemical agents to be reduced.
In March 2020, China reported problems in accuracy of its own test kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by the CDC were "lacking".The government then imposed bureaucratic restrictions on conducting special endurance tests.Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but discovered that the test results were not accurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to difficulty in collecting samples or incorrect use of the kit.
The Spanish minister announced that he would not use kits that yielded incorrect results and would replace them with a different test kit produced by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China received incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which gave incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that the kits be dumped into the Danube River.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and were "not considered to be usable".The British government purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that the kits were unusable.
The test followed by quarantine of people whose test result was positive and tracking of those who were in contact with people who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 virus result has been positive.
Researchers working in the city of Vò Italia, where the first death from COVID-19 in Italy occurred at the time, conducted two rounds of testing within a ten-day period on a total population of about 3,400 people.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and all positive cases were quarantined.
By restricting travel to public centers, new infections have been completely eradicated.
With serious tracking of contacts, restrictions, testing and quarantine of travellers entering, the pandemic year 2020 coronavirus in Singapore was much slower than in other developed countries, though without severe restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been canceled and Singapore on 28 March recommended residents stay at home, but schools reopened after the holidays, on 23 March and at the scheduled time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts, restricting, testing and quarantining travellers entering, with fewer lockdowns.
A statistical study has shown that countries that have more tests than the number of foci have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to diagnose those who have only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that lack testing capacity and have limited national laboratories with limited experience in the field of COVID-19 submit the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of the COVID-19 self-test to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for approval.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 is in North America and 1 is in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% positive for total tests" is influenced by the testing policy of each country.
If all other conditions are the same, "% positive for total tests" in a country that tests only hospitalized people would be higher than in a country that tests all citizens, whether they have a disease or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning a person's hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constantly washing hands with soap in "sensitive locations" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and plague that are transmitted through the mouth.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes), they may develop respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds.
Important positions during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby or replacing the diaper or, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If soap and water are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends handwashing in the following ways:
Before, during and after preparing a meal.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After replacing a diaper or cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After finishing, surfing or sniffing.
After touching animals, animal waste, or feeding animals.
Health, regardless of medical care, refers to health measures related to medical practices.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent the onset of disease or minimize its transmission.
The main purpose of hand washing is medically, cleaning the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause risk or disease.
This is especially important for people who have a diet or who work in medical-related occupations, and of course, for the general public as well.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing diarrheal infections; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce infant mortality during home birth.
A 2013 study found that improvements in hand shake practices may lead to a slight improvement in the growth of height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the mortality rate from respiratory diseases and childhood diarrhea can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple measure could reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote shalt water can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and providing clean water in low-income areas is comparable.
Handwashing with soap, as an automated behavior that has become a habit in homes, schools and communities around the world, is the only, most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, one of the most important acute respiratory infections, is a leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia are also responsible for the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, replacing hand washing with soap before meals and after using the toilet with a strict habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reduce diarrheal mortality by almost half and reduce deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Shashwaswas is usually integrated with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
The hand sanitizer also protects against yellow fever infection that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful but minor effects of hand shedding is that repeated hand shedding can lead to skin dryness and consequent skin damage.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin itching, which is also known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Frequent coughing is also remembered as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce transmission of gastrointestinal disease include: after going to the laundry (drinking, padding), after cleaning the baby (replacing diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other procedures that must be followed to prevent disease transmission include washing hands before and after treatment of a cut or wound, after vomiting, vomiting or flushing; after touching animal waste or touching animals; and after contact with garbage.
In many countries, the amount of hand soap is very low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7 percent of households changed hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest hand washing rate, or 97 percent; the United States was in the middle with 77 percent and China was in the bottom with 23 percent. Currently, there are several ways to change the pace to increase hand washing at important times.
The basic health care program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of a broad set of measures to improve the level of health and education in children.
Finger removal twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap, daily toothbrushing with fluoride, is the main focus of this program.
In Indonesia, too, the program has been successfully implemented.
Adding soap or detergent with water is effective in eliminating microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solubility and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins, which are a component of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, the flow of sufficient water helps in cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may retain bacteria from previous uses.
Few studies that have examined the transmission of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transmission of bacteria in this way seems unlikely because the bacteria are thoroughly scrubbed.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still believes that "liquid soap that is accessible without direct contact is better".
Antibacterial soaps for people who care about hygiene have been heavily promoted.
To date, there is no evidence that an anti-inflammatory or antifungal agent is effective in killing antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as triclosan, which are resistant to a wide variety of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not meant to be soaked with antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as advertised on the market.
Advanced formulations, in addition to a surfactant and a skin-protective substance, may contain acid (sticky acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, benzoic acid as an antimicrobial agent and other skin softeners (melting agent, vitamin, menthol, vegetable extract).A comprehensive analysis by the Faculty of Public Health at the University of Oregon found that soap is as effective as ordinary antibacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and killing hand bacteria.
Hot water used for hand washing is not stained enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap in eliminating natural oils that contain dust and bacteria.
Despite this and contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on microbial behaviour.
An anti-inflammatory agent is a non-aquatic sanitary agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol sanitary products (also known as alcohol-based disinfectants or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these are isopropyl alcohols or ethanol combined with a thickener such as a carburetor (acrylic acid polymer) and made in a gel form, or for ease of use and reduction of the drying effect, all use a solvent such as glycerin and are made in liquid or powder form.
Addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases most antimicrobial activity.Anti-contaminants containing at least 60 to 95 percent of the total are effective microbial pesticides.
Alcohol-containing disinfectants cause the destruction of bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB and some viruses (including HIV, smallpox, RSV, rhinovirus, mumps, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Anti-inflammatory agents containing 70% of the total, 30 seconds after use, cause the destruction of 99.97% (less than 3.5 logs equivalent to less than 35 decb) of hand bacteria and 1 minute after use, cause the destruction of 99.99% to 99.999% (less than 4 to 5 logs) of hand bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost ineffective compared to other viruses (or Norwalk), which are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.An adequate amount of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or gel should be used to fully soak or cover both hands.
The back and sides of both hands, the middle and ends of all fingers should be soaked for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing more than using an anti-inflammatory handwash, especially when the hands are completely dirty.
The increasing use of these materials is due to their ease of use and their ability to quickly destroy microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for washing the right hands unless soap and water are available.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless skin softeners or moisturizers are added to their formulations.
Adding glycerin or other softeners to the formula for their preparation can reduce the effect of drying alcohol or eliminate the cold.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol and softeners produced much less inflammation and dry skin than soaps or antimicrobials.
Allergic dermatitis, allergic cataract syndrome, or alcohol or alcohol-related sensitivity or additives present in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers, rarely occurs.
A lower chance of developing contact dermatitis than washing hands with soap caused the appeal of the anus.
Despite their effectiveness, water-based materials do not cleanse the hands of mechanical materials, but they make them anti-inflammatory.
For this reason, hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective at preventing the spread of many diseases, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The anti-inflammatory effect of smokeless hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on their ingredients and formulation and has historically been less effective than total alcohol-containing anti-inflammatories.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have more cumulative and continuous antimicrobial activity after use, unlike the ones that, after repeated use, probably due to adverse reactions of the skin, decrease their effectiveness.
Many people in low-income communities cannot produce soap and instead use ashes or ashes.
Ash or dust may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One of their concerns is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease, rather than slowing down the spread of the disease.
Ashes, like soap, are an anti-inflammatory substance, because they form a calcified solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends ash or copper as a substitute for soap.
The correct hand shedding method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Soak your hands in running water, hot or cold.
It is recommended that running water be used because wastewater may be contaminated, while water temperature does not appear to change.
Rub your hands with a large amount of soap and rub them with a soap, including the back of the hand, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap eliminates germs on the skin and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub your hands together for at least 20 seconds.
Hand-washing causes friction and helps remove germs from the skin, while hand-washing for longer periods of time eliminates more germs.
Hands with self-pumping water.
Getting a shake in a rocky water can re-infect the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands can be easily contaminated.Most of the parts of the hand that remain seated include the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cut nail locks may be the hiding place of microorganisms.
Wet-up creams are often recommended to prevent hand drying.Dry skin has caused skin damage and can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are various low-cost options for facilitating handwashing in developing countries where tap water or soap is not available, such as pouring water from a gallon or a hole-in-hole container or using ash if necessary. In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water consumption, such as "tip tap or small water lighters" and other low-cost options.
Tipping is a simple technology made from a container that is attached by rope and a paddle controlled by a foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand sanitization process, but there is debate about the most effective way to dry hands in public washrooms.
The increasing volume of research suggests that paper towels are much healthier than the electric dryer found in many laundry facilities.
In 2008, a study supported by the paper industry, the European Waste Symposium, was organized by the University of Westminster in London to compare the hygiene of paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria present in the tips of the fingers increased by an average of 194% and the number of bacteria present in the palms increased by 254%.
Air-drying hand dryers increased the average number of total bacteria present in the tips of the fingers by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria in the tips of the fingers dropped by an average of 76% and in the gloves by 77%.Scientists also conducted experiments to determine whether there was a possibility of the mutual transmission of contamination from other users of the towel and the washing environment due to the use of different methods of hand drying.
The air-drying machine, which according to its claims, can blow out the air at 180 meters per second (650 km or 400 mph), is capable of smoking microorganisms from hands and devices and potentially can contaminate other users of the laundry room as well as the laundry room up to a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hot air dryer, it can scatter microorganisms up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause significant microorganism emissions.In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were investigated.
The following changes were observed in a number of bacteria after hand drying:
There are a large number of hand dryer manufacturers and hand dryer dryer dryer has been compared to paper towels.
If there is no soap and water when travelling, washing hands using hand sanitizer towels can be used as an alternative method.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer must have at least 60% alcohol content.
Long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis diagnosed the effectiveness of hand shedding (in 1846) in preventing infection in a hospital setting, medical hand shedding was compulsory.
There are electronic devices that can remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that infection rates were reduced by using them.
The time required for a medical hand shake is at least 15 seconds, which is done using a sufficient amount of soap and water or a gel and rubbing all parts of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed with them and fingers crossed.
If there is a wrinkle under the nails, I can use a year to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is very important that the hands are well watered and dried with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, paper rolls should be used to seal the water (and if necessary to open the exit door).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by contacting surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in treatment centers is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that in most hospital settings, handwashing is unacceptable, so much so that a large number of doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before contact with patients, causing microorganisms to be transmitted.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce up to 66 percent of the amount of blood flow contamination that the cat is involved in.The World Health Organization has published a paper that shows the standard method of hand washing and hand massage is also applicable in healthcare sectors.
The draft manual for hand hygiene, prepared by the organization on its website, is also publicly available.
A related review of the topic was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If it is necessary to prove compliance with the regulations, commercial devices can measure and verify the level of hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has defined the "five times" for hand washing:
After being exposed to blood/fluids
before performing any anti-inflammatory activities, and
After taking care of the patient, adding chemical disinfectants to soap (soap "medicinal" or "anti-microbial") enhances the life-sustaining properties of the causative agent.
Such measures may be considered before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic resistant organisms are highly prevalent.To wash hands before surgery, the following requirements are required: a water bottle that can be opened and closed without direct contact, a quantity of chlorhexidine or yeast, sterile towels to dry hands after washing and sterile presses to clean specific shistles and other sterile tools to clean under the nails.
All the jewels must be brought out.
In this method, it is necessary to wash the ring with the hand and hand for usually 2-6 minutes.
Long shedding (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When drawing water, help prevent water from returning to the surface with your hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgical garment is covered.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to use hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers before and after taking care of a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been determined that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning comes from the first 20% of the shush and when the hand cleaning cycle reaches more than 35%, it has very few additional benefits.
Comparison of handwashing with a total-based solution with handwashing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds showed that handwashing with antibacterial soap reduces the amount of bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap.
But using soap and water rather than hand washing with alcohol-based products is more effective at reducing the H1N1 influenza A virus and cholesterol defaseal than hand washing.The measures needed to improve hand hygiene in health centers can include training workers to wash their hands, increasing access to alcohol-based towels, and writing and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is more effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is remembered as an affordable and essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
Despite the lack of safe water, soap or sanitation in homes, schools and workplaces, the availability of the necessary sanitation practices is challenging globally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water pipes for washing hands near personal or public toilets are scarce, although cheaper options exist for building hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of handwashing, mostly not due to the lack of soap or water, but can be a result of bad habits.
Promoting the use of soap can influence electoral policies, raise awareness of the benefits of the use of soap and lead to long-term behavioural change at the community level.
The necessary monitoring and evaluation is necessary to ensure that this work is effectively carried out.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social advocacy campaigns are less effective.One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the "Three-Star Rating" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to ensure that by taking simple, inexpensive steps, students will wash their hands with soap, while complying with other health requirements.
By adhering to minimum standards, schools can eventually grow from one star to three stars.
The construction of Shashthai Hand stations can be part of the communication measures for Shashthai Hand, which is being carried out to reduce disease and mortality in children.
World Shashwashi Day is another example of awareness-raising programs that aim to change people's mobility.As a result of the coronavirus pandemic of 20-2019, UNICEF promoted the use of Shashwashi emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the more economical use of shorthand in developing countries in relation to the number of years lost due to disability.
However, one study shows that the promotion of hand-to-hand soap is significantly more economically viable than other measures.
For the first time, the importance of hand sanitization for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospital - was highlighted in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand sanitization: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was the "founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant odor called miasma.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of food-related diseases and health-care-related infections led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to more broadly promote hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against infectious diseases.
For example, posters called "Right-to-do hand washing machines" were installed alongside hand washing sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "doing something" means declaring a person's unwillingness to accept responsibility for or participate in a subject.
The term is borrowed from the Bible text of Matthew, where Pontius Pilate refused to crucify Christ, but the phrase is now used in some English-speaking societies with a much wider application.
In Macbeth Shakespeare, Mrs. Macbeth, in an attempt to clear a fictional stain, forced herself to shake her hands, representing her guilty conscience for the crimes she had committed and encouraging her husband to commit.
It has also been found that individuals, after being reminded or tamed of immoral actions, tend to wash their hands more than others and tend to have more hands-washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a thorough wash are less likely to participate in other forced "cleaning" activities, such as volunteer work.
Washing hand symbols and using water and soap to wash hands are part of the ritual of washing hands, which has been exhibited in many religions including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, the Twelve and the resulting Yadvaim in Judaism, the Asherah in Christianity and the Asherah in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam order washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands before and after each meal.
Control the risks associated with COVID-19 at work.
The control of risks associated with COVID-19 in the workplace means using safe health methods to control risks in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and type of job and should be based on an assessment of risk sources, severity of illness in the community and risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) statement, occupational workers who are less at risk have less work contact with ordinary people and other colleagues and are recommended to take basic measures to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, observing breathing habits and maintaining daily hygiene and workplace contamination.
Employees who are at moderate risk include those in whom employees need frequent or close contact with people who have not been infected with or suspected of COVID-19, but may become infected due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel.
This includes those who have contact with the general public, such as in schools, in high-density workplaces and in some retailers with a high volume of people.
Risk control for this group, in addition to basic prevention measures, includes air conditioning through high-efficiency air filters, protection for thirst and personal protective equipment in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care workers who are in contact with people who are infected or suspected of COVID-19, including those who are considered at high risk, to be at very high risk if they perform work that results in the production of particulate matter suspended in the air or collect, move or handle samples of people who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
The appropriate method for controlling risk for these individuals includes engineering controls such as creating negative pressure ventilation rooms and using personal protective equipment that is proportionate to the job task.
The outbreak of COVID-19 can have a variety of effects on the working environment.
Employees may not be present at work due to illness, the need to care for others or fear of potential exposure.
Business patterns may change slowly, both depending on what goods are needed and how these goods are available (such as shopping during off-peak hours or shopping through home delivery services or shopping by car).
Finally, the transport of goods from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 can be stopped, and the necessary preparation and programs for responding to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
These programs assess and manage the level of risk associated with workplaces and various occupational tasks, including sources of exposure to disease, risk factors from the home and community environment, and individual risk factors for employees such as old age or chronic illness.
It also describes the control measures needed to eliminate those risks as well as the possible plans to address situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The necessary preparation and plans for responding to infectious diseases may be based on national or local recommendations.
Reactions to outbreaks include reducing disease transmission between employees, protecting people who are most at risk of health complications, maintaining business activities and minimizing the negative impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in areas where commercial activities take place affects the decision-making process.
Risk management hierarchies are a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk management according to their effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective methods of control are engineering controls and then administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering control methods require keeping employees away from work-related hazards without relying on the speed of employees and can be the most cost-effective and cost-effective solution that can be implemented.
Methods of administrative control involve changes in policy or work practices implemented by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative control methods, but can somewhat prevent exposure to the virus.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of the risks that exist for employees, installed correctly (e.g., respirators), continuously and correctly coated, regularly inspected, maintained and, if necessary, replaced, properly removed, cleaned and properly maintained or disposed of to prevent pollution.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) statement, occupations with less risk are less likely to have workplace contact with ordinary people and other colleagues.
The basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all workplaces include washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, observing breathing habits including mouth and nose coverings when vomiting, preparing paper towels and garbage cans, preparing for work remotely or in shift shifts if necessary, encouraging employees not to use other people's tools and equipment, and organizing a clean and disinfected work environment.
Quickly identifying and isolating people who are potentially infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home as long as they are naked for at least 24 hours without using a fever reducer or other symptom-modifying medication, and that licensing policies should be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for sick family members, and employees should be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations at medium risk include those where employees need frequent contact or close contact at a distance of less than six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not infected with or suspected of contracting COVID-19, but may become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing spread of the virus in the community or due to international travel to areas where COVID-19 is widespread.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in places such as schools, crowded workplaces and some busy retailers.The engineering control method for these and high-risk groups can include installing high-powered air filters, increasing ventilation, installing physical barriers such as plastic smoke detectors and installing self-service windows to customers.Administrative controls for these and the groups at higher risk include: encouraging sick employees to stay at home, replacing ro-ro sessions with virtual communications, creating alternating shifts, avoiding unnecessary travel to areas at risk of the COVID-19 outbreak, creating emergency communication programs to respond to customer concerns, including training staff on COVID-19 risk factors and personal protective measures, ensuring that people wear and use personal protective equipment, providing access to safe and safe working environments, providing access to safe and safe working conditions, providing access to safe and safe working conditions, providing access to safe working conditions, providing access to safe working conditions, providing adequate medical care, and other facilities, and providing adequate medical care, including medical care, medical care, medical care, and other services.
Workers who are considered to be at risk in this group rarely need to use a respirator.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate measures to protect the personnel and other passengers may include separating the patient from others at a distance of 6 feet, allocating only one crew member to serve the patient and provide a mask to the patient, or requesting the patient to cover his mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
The flight crew must use disposable medical gloves when taking care of a sick passenger or when contact is made with contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and if the patient is suffering from fever, persistent nausea or shortness of breath, they must use more personal protective equipment.
For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger boats, risk control includes delaying travel in case of illness, quarantine, and in case of fever or other symptoms during travel, prompt notification to the medical center on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the quarantine ward of the person.For schools and child care centers, if an infected person has entered the school building regardless of the outbreak in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends closing the building for a short time for cleaning or disinfection purposes.
If the transmission of disease in the community is low or moderate, the following measures can be implemented in the direction of social distancing: the abolition of scientific circles, congregations and other large gatherings such as physical training classes or do or just eat in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between tables, distancing between entry and exit times, restricting unnecessary visitors and the separate use of sanitary facilities for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant risk of community transmission, in addition to social distancing measures, long-term school closures should be considered.For law enforcement personnel who carry out their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers their immediate health risks to be low.
Law enforcement officers who need to be in contact with people who are infected or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the guidelines that emergency medical technicians follow, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact with the arresting person, employees should remove their belts and their apparatus before re-use using household cleaning spray or clean and disinfectant towels, while following standard procedures for using and removing personal protective equipment (PPE) used and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognizes health care workers, including those at high risk, as well.
Employees at high risk include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to people who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
Employees whose work results in the production of particulate matter suspended in air or who collect, move or handle samples of people infected or suspected of COVID-19 are at a very high risk.
The tasks that result in the production of particles suspended in air include piping, surgical casting, bronchoscopy and some dental operations and examinations or invasive sampling of the patient.
Employees at very high risk include workers who are engaged in preparing the bodies of people who are at risk of death or suspected of being infected with COVID-19. If a carcass is cracked, the risk level is too high. Additional engineering control methods for this group include creating separate rooms for patients who are infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, including when performing tasks that result in the production of particles suspended in the air.
Negative air pressure may be appropriate for some healthcare facilities.
Patient samples should also be handled taking into account the level 3 biogeographic precautions.
In addition to using other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of a respirator for ventilators that operate within 6 feet of patients infected or suspected of COVID-19 and for those who perform tasks that result in airborne particulate matter production.
In the United States, the N95 respiratory filter is approved by NIOSH and is used in accordance with the requirements of a comprehensive respiratory health program that includes appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of all body types of coverings because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks only for the screening of individuals at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends that people who collect respiratory samples from patients or care for or carry patients with COVID-19 and do not perform any work that results in airborne particulate matter use surgical masks, glasses or face protectors, guns and gloves.
If an operation is performed in which particles are produced suspended in air, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends the following to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: conducting medical examinations in non-attendance, creating physical barriers such as installing transparent windows, allowing only people directly involved in the care of a COVID-19 patient to enter a room, using personal protective equipment only for specific tasks, using a respiratory mask when caring for multiple patients who all have a disease, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and not using a mask for people without symptoms.

[Covid-19] Lifting the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of submission: 14 March 2020, at 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: Rights not reserved
This month we find ourselves in a remarkable situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that clearly sheds light on the global connections of human beings and our responsibilities to one another.
The challenges ahead are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response to empathy, cooperation and socialization is at the heart of the organization.
The level of care and support we have observed among our colleagues through email, contact and chat shows incredible people we have the privilege and honor to work alongside.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all as a colleague, beside me.
Last week, I appreciated one of the things we do.
They reminded me how significant it is that the world can now visit Wikipedia and what a powerful sign that this important resource can be made available online and accessible to all.
Your work provides this possibility, whether you keep your sites up to date, your colleagues receive a reward, or your communities are safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
This is the moment when not only what we do but also the way we work will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant changes to the way we do our joint tasks from the beginning of next week.
Modifications to the car and its programs.
As Robin noted earlier, Team-C met last night to discuss our approach and plan for the upcoming days and months.
During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the right answer to what we were facing and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We wanted to relieve stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce it, that's fine.
to all employees, contractors and contractors:
Secondary notice, we are waiting for 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We're not announcing a shutdown - if you can work more normal hours, you'll be burned out of the mission.
However, the world is currently unpredictable and it doesn't matter if you are caring for your loved ones, buying groceries, or seeing a doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not drive.
This should go without saying, but we're not going to say it.
It is not necessary to obtain a license for use or personal license - just tell your manager and help your team to review calendars and schedules and make sure that it has covered some key tasks.
(If your COVID-19 test result has been positive, please notify Bryan of the T&C department so that T&C can help you and ensure that your situation is properly managed).
The wages of employees who work hourly are paid in full.
As we have said before, we are committed to our commitments to contractors and colleagues who work on a part-time basis.
Everyone's wages are paid according to normal working hours under normal conditions.
This includes you even if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to release their stress to the world around them.
What we do, especially in such situations, can be very valuable.
I repeat, it's about your self-meditation.
Please keep in touch with your manager so we know what to expect and can plan accordingly.
Some tasks are considered necessary.
There are things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, trust and safety teams and the attraction of capital (and some other) perform basic and important tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with other departments to evaluate current objectives and focus on supporting the necessary items for our mission.
For all of us there is much to do, we will all focus on the most basic projects.
If we slow down the trend now, we won't see any harm later.
We do not plan to work twice as hard now as soon as the pandemic is over and to tackle the issues.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impossible.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will seek new goals and timetables if necessary.
How is APP (annual planning) done?
To keep pace with the latest realities and expectations of daily work hours, we plan to self-adjust the delivery schedule of the 2021-2020 annual program.
Our goal is to propose an extension of the 2020-2019 program that will allow us more time to budget and allow employees to prioritize vital tasks, self-care and caring for loved ones, while allowing those who need or want to work fewer hours over the next few weeks.
This extension of time limits greatly reduces the stress on current work programs throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and as soon as it is approved, we will inform the representatives and teams of the next steps.
Thank you for the annual planning team to lead this effort.
Office status, exposure to illness and cleaning.
Last week we received information that one of our colleagues based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, for greater caution, we used an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces as well as to remove lobbies and elevators that lead to a class.
This building uses self-monitoring protocols and uses products that are useful for the safety of its residents.
We are confident that when we decide to return, the office will be well prepared.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork and they have shared a COVID-19 protocol with all of our DC-based employees.
In accordance with the San Francisco State Guidelines, the Washington, D.C. office has since become a completely remote collection.
As some of my colleagues based in New York know, we also talked about renting a house in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Older colleagues who work with us remotely know that this can be a case-by-case basis and want to give you some advice:
Limit sessions to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how they can be held in a matter of days.
Make the meeting clear, have a schedule, and submit the required study materials in advance.
By default, set up the video using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and communication.
Appoint someone to lead the meeting, someone to monitor the chat to follow up on questions and lists of speakers, and someone to take notes (or joint notes).
If you need a comfortable headset, email the technical support team.
Use your health allowance for snacks.
Also join the channel #remoties on Slack to talk about shared cars with your colleagues.
The HR team to support the increase in work is distributed throughout the base, following ergonomics-based guidance and a seminar.
Last week we asked all recipients of grants at the foundation level such as editathon to cancel public events funded by Wikipedia until the World Health Organization has declared an end to the pandemic.
We inform them that we know that our request to cancel programs and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out agreed activities related to receiving financial concessions and that no one will be penalized for delaying or correcting their objectives.
Next week we will be providing more guidance on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community meetings.
It seems that the general feeling across the global community is both discomfort due to these disorders and at the same time a sense of satisfaction due to their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their own communities, Wikimedia, etc.
Just as before my visit, CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor its impact and maintain our connections with them.
Connectivity on issues related to COVID-19
For the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC to 07:00 PT, we will send a meeting invitation for special staff to your calendars.
We take advantage of this time to provide you with new and more information, answer your questions, and spend time simply communicating with each other.
We are all in this together and we are committed to helping you in any way we can.
In addition, you can find relevant information via this email and other COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT updates these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain organized contact with our employees who are residents of countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, mainstream or news coverage challenges, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to report and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help and support you if needed.
If you would like to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - International Human Resources Operations Manager.
None of these changes should be considered as giving up work or commitments.
Rather, it indicates that at this moment our work and commitments may need to be adapted to a way of life that we have not had in the past.
These are the stages that we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue our work and support our movement and provide services that the world depends on.
The things you planned for when the time came, will be waiting for us.
It is indeed time to support one another and create the space for important tasks to be done in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to realize this, so we ask you to take care of yourself and your families so that when the need arises, you can be at your best.
Now, please shake hands and do not touch yourself!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'enzyme-converter angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membrane) of lung, liver, heart, kidney and intestinal cells.
ACE2 activates the activity of the enzyme associated angiotance-converter (ACE) by decreasing the amount of angiotance-II and increasing (Ang(1-7), which has also transformed its ability to be a target of optimistic medication for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of metabolite-containing enzyme that is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptidease M2 domain and an amino acid-containing domain, which is the C-terminal collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-transit membrane protein of type I that has the active range of an enzyme located adjacent to the surface of lung cells and other buffets.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 along with another enzyme called scratch is separated from the cleft domain and the protein solution obtained after entering the bloodstream is finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 contains the cell membrane of most types of cerebrospinal cells, mainly the revy, small intestinal enterocytes, endothelial and marrow cells, and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA signals are seen in the cortex of the brain, the body's outline, the hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 as an ACE inhibitor is its activity.
ACE converts the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin narrowing vein II.
ACE2 in turn separates the phenylalanine amino acid carboxyl terminal from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and is then hydrolyzed by angiotensin veins (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can inhibit a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-Bradie Kane, Appelin, Neurotensin, Dinorphine A and Grelin Ra.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane flow of the amino acid-neutral SLC6A19 and plays a role in heart disease.
ACE2, as a cleavage protein, plays the role of the main entry point into the RA cell for certain coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-causing virus).
More importantly, gluing the protein spike S1 to the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses to the ACE2 enzyme domain at the cell level leads to the inward inflammation and displacement of the virus and enzyme in the endosomes inside cells.
This entry process requires the preparation of protein S by the TMPRSS2 protease serine host, whose retention is currently under investigation as a potential treatment. The hypothesis has been raised that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, professional societies and multiple regulatory agencies have suggested that treatment with ACE and ARB inhibitors should continue.
A regular and meta-analytical review published on July 11, 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a dramatic 34 percent decrease in the likelihood of pneumonia compared to controls.
Meanwhile, the risk of pneumonia decreased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of developing pneumonia, especially those who had suffered a stroke and heart attack.
The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a decrease in lung-related deaths, although the results compared to the overall results were less likely to develop pneumonia.
However, it is thought that ACE in human retinal artery disease (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute renal injury and apparently improved homodynamic respiration and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of effect (duration) is 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a novel drug for people with systemic inhibitor allergies and classical renin-angiotance (RSA inhibitor) or circulatory angiotance enhancement factor II disorders.
b'Covid-19 programs are mobile software applications that are used to keep contact during the coronavirus pandemic of 20-2019, i.e. the process of identifying people (relations) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Multiple programs have been developed or proposed that in some territories and regions are supported by government officials.
Multiple frameworks for the preparation of contact tracking programs have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially in systems based on the geolocation of app users.
From less intrusive solutions, Bluetooth signals can be used to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would include support for Bluetooth-based applications directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed a program whereby citizens can help them understand whether or not they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
The program has been deployed in more than 200 cities in China.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The program was developed by the local IT community, is open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has released a Bluetooth-based program called "StopKorona!" to prevent potential contact with infected individuals and provide immediate response to healthcare referrals.
The programme was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting confirmation from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the call planning was in an advanced stage of development and would be ready to be stabilized within a few weeks.
Both Australia and the Netherlands have plans based on the TraceTogether program and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geographically defined program for COVID-19 patients and residents of Moscow, to prevent these people from leaving their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has pointed to a number of practical problems associated with program-oriented systems, including false positive results and possible inefficiencies when using a program in small population samples.
While investigating the issues associated with the spread of misleading or malicious apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the type of organizations that are authorized to add apps to the App Store and only allows official or trusted organizations to do so.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have monitored the impact of surveillance using coronavirus outreach programs, and in particular stated that it is unclear whether surveillance infrastructure developed for the coronavirus pandemic will be eliminated once the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued statements calling for a limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations are listed as eight requirements for government proposals:
Supervision must be legal, necessary and proportionate.
The surveillance and surveillance facilities must be securely secured with automatic cancellation possible;
The use of data should be limited to cases related to COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be guaranteed and protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should not be used to exacerbate discrimination and isolation.
The transfer of data to third parties must be within the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be taken into account to prevent abuse and citizens' right to complain about abuse.
A targeted participation of all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and groups on the margins, is essential.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) in Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published lists.
A proposed Google/Apple program aimed at dealing with the difficulty of continuous monitoring by removing the device's remote control from their device's operating systems has been presented, once necessary.
In some countries, the network-based localization process has been used instead of the program, and as a result, the need to download the program and the ability to escape isolation have been eliminated.
In Israel, the network-axis isolation has been approved.
Network-axis solutions that access raw data from the location may violate privacy.
However, not all central server systems require access to personal geographic data; some privacy systems use central servers only for internal communications (see section below).
In South Korea, an unprogrammed system was used to keep in touch.
Instead of using a specialized program, the system collected and used tracking information from various sources, including tracking data on mobile devices and card transaction data, to notify people who may have been infected with the car.
In addition to using this information to send messages to potential audiences, location information is also publicly available, and this type of disclosure is authorized by the government due to widespread changes in information protection laws, due to the outbreak of MERS in the country.
Some countries, such as Germany, have taken into account the use of centralized systems and privacy safeguards.
As of April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been disclosed.
Privacy-keeping is an accepted concept that dates back to at least 2013 when documented research was conducted.By April 7, 2020, dozens of expert groups were working on privacy-keeping solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT effort is coordinated, which incorporates centralized and decentralized approaches and is not independent of the protocol.Of the decentralized protocols, I can refer to the decentralized close deployment with privacy protection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, also known as contact event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols (PACT) and planetary contact protection agreements (PACT).
In these protocols, personal data is never removed from the device and all matching occurs inside the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is engaged in developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy practices in the process of collecting and consuming location and routing data, to counter the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The platform was developed based on the research findings contained in the official report The following programs: Protecting Privacy During Pandemic, which was published in March 2020.Another similar innovation, the SafeTrace platform, is Enigma MPC.The company also developed privacy technologies that were developed at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data without compromising data privacy with other users and controllers.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by a number of groups that had come together to focus on what were essentially similar and largely mutually compatible protocols, aimed at reducing dispersion and providing a framework for global cooperation in the field of prevention and alerting programs, from key aspects of achieving broad acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, which was also used in the official government program, publicly available.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, unveiled a call tracking initiative that they claim is intended to protect privacy.This initiative is based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy encryption.
They also published specifications of the original technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is scheduled to be launched in three stages:
Introducing empowerment tools for governments to create privacy-friendly coronavirus response programs
Google and Apple intend to solve the problems of continued acceptance and monitoring by distributing the system through the operating system and then removing it in a similar manner after the threat is removed.
b'Drug substitution (also known as change of use, change of profile, change of duty or drug replacement therapy) is the modification of the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or physical ailment different from what the drug was originally developed for.
This is a pathway of scientific research being implemented to develop safe and effective COVID-19 therapies.
Among other research goals, I could point out the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of plasma from an improved individual.SARS-CoV-2 has 66 pharmaceutical protein ranges, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
These analysis of the contact points provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Of the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we can point to the protozoa semi-papine, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helix, protein S and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A and colleagues will examine several proposed drugs that were then analyzed and optimized to resemble the most confirmed drugs at the time for their skeletal similarities to those that were approved to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in the preclinical study that was to be proposed in the design of the clinical study.
Chloroquine is a type of antimalarial drug that is also used to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are related components of four drugs being studied in a clinical trial.
Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, announced that New York state trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfates and chloroquine phosphates RA with Combined Emergency Use (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA in the clinical trial process and is authorized for use in the USA only for trial treatment and emergency use in hospitalized patients who are unable to receive medication in a clinical trial.
The CDC has announced that the need for, amount of, or duration of, the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been determined.
Doctors have stated that they will take these drugs if there are no other options.
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey is carrying out a small research project on the use of chloroquine in combination with rhi, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
Longon NYU School of Medicine is conducting an experimental study on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen China claimed that favipiravir was completely effective.
The test result in 35 patients was negative for an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who had not been diagnosed was 11 days.
In a study in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence available for the efficacy of the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its own storage and would seek help from the military to deliver the medicine to training hospitals, where it would use the drug to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has offered to buy the drug to the Trump administration, which may not be very effective for treating acute cases of disease in which the virus has spread.
Use of the en may not be safe for pregnant women or people who plan to become pregnant.
A review of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviruses lopinavir and ritonavir, determined that no benefit was observed.
These drugs were designed to prevent the spread of HIV by gluing to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to find a combination that can match the SARS-CoV-2 proteinase to improve these drugs.In the scientific community, criticism has been raised about directing resources toward changing the use of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lopinavir/ritonavir in an international trial.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg viral infections, and later found that Remdesivir was active in the laboratory against the viruses Fellow, Panoma, Paramexo and Corona.
One of the problems of antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutation, which may lead to more severe illnesses and vagaries.
Some pre-clinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic inhibitor of resistance formation. Several clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland Training Hospital, are underway. One involves people with mild illness and the other involves people with severe illness.
Three clinical trials have been conducted on the effects of intravenous vitamin C injection on people in bed with severe COVID-19 disease in the run-up to the outbreak. Two cases are controlled with drug overdose (China and Canada) and one case is uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began the trial of the Azithromycin antibiotic RA on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for World Health and Medicine of Japan (NCGM) is planning to run a clinical trial for Alvesco tejin (cyclosonide), a type of asthma-injecting corticosteroid, to treat patients without symptoms and infected with the novel coronavirus.
A type of Phase II trial involving angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 involves 200 patients in the current study. 200 hospitalized patients and, unfortunately, from Denmark, Germany and Austria are being given the opportunity to determine the effectiveness of this treatment in this trial.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute of Canada are investigating the role of chloroquine in reducing inflammation and respiratory effects in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colon Corona, involved 6,000 patients aged at least 40 years who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms and no need for hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women using effective methods of contraception are not eligible to participate in the study.
Several blood transfusion drugs are under review in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients and for this reason, the Italian Medical Agency is obliged to publish consumption guidelines.
A cross-sectional news study involving 300 patients to examine the effect of sodium anoxaparin on dose prevention and treatment was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a type of virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on changing the use of antiviral drugs that were produced to treat previous viral diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin according to the guidelines of the 7th China Council for the treatment of COVID-19 is recommended
OmniVenue: OmniVenue is recommended according to the Guidelines of the 7th China Virus for the treatment of COVID-19.
Among the antibiotics that have been proposed as a possible alternative to COVID-19 treatments, I can point to the following:
Tokylizumab (containing Anti-IL-6): It has been approved in China.
Also see the internships in Italy and China. and also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'vaccine is a fake COVID-19 vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, multiple attempts to develop the vaccine are underway.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, to be available for 18 months.
Five vaccines proposed in April were under Phase I immunity studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A global outbreak of pandemics occurred in 2020 and led to significant investment and research activities for vaccine development.
Many organizations use distributed genomes to produce a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that CEPI's requirements for vaccine development included speed, production capacity, stability on scale and average accessibility.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were undergoing research and development in early 2020 to produce an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have been included in Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (expansion phase I and vaccine proposed: modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (stage I expansion agent and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus carrier type 5)
According to CEPI scientists announced in April, a total of 115 proposed vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them have been approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute statement) and 37 others have been made public, but information about a few of them is not publicly available (assuming they are in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II screening is a preliminary safety and safety review process, usually randomized and controlled by a darumast, performed at various centers and determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually have more participants from a control group and, in order to assess the effectiveness of vaccines for disease prevention, will treat side effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 proposed vaccines in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested on humans (still in clinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that research was underway on the potential of a molecular vaccine to genetically modify viral proteins and simulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that research on the vaccine will begin in 2021 and that human trials on it will begin in 2021.
Plans for vaccine development were presented at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, pharmaceutical company Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun the development process of a vaccine.
Janssen, in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart, is developing a food vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production collaboration with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published an article on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to vaccines used to treat neogenous antigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine development work had been completed and was in the early stages of testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had begun plans to produce a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They intended to produce a vaccine that could then be tested on humans for 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Research and Medical Facility at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Institute of Military Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions, in partnership with Novavax, was founded in
The field of vaccine development and production was reported.
The partners later announced that preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials would be conducted by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that the trials were being conducted on 11 individuals in quarantine and that development of the vaccine in the shortest possible time would take at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company active in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The proposed vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and human trials are scheduled to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac to provide "a huge amount of money" to pay for the exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government has opposed.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
A proposed mRNA-based vaccine, called BNT162, is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, of Italian biotech companies, announced that the results of their preclinical trials would be ready in April 2020 and that their final proposed vaccine might be tested on humans before the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Counter-Pandemic Innovation (CEPI) announced that it had invested $4.9 million in a research consortium of COVID-19 vaccine research, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienne, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun testing six different proposed vaccines on animals.
Researchers at Royal College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-reinforcing RNA vaccine to combat COVID-19.
The proposed vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the information from China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced that $275 million Canadian dollars was being considered to finance 96 research projects in the field of COVID-19 response, including several vaccines proposed in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan programs.
Around the same time, the Government of Canada announced that Canada had allocated 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and that plans were underway to create a national vaccine bank comprising several new vaccines, capable of being used in the event of other cases of coronavirus outbreaks.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the PittCoVacc test, a proposed COVID-19 vaccine, on mice, and announced that single SARS-CoV-2 S1 subvaxxins with strong MNA antigen-specific antigen reactions [in mice] that had been detected 2 weeks after immunization were eliminated.
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a proposed DNA-based vaccine, likely in a nasal-like form.
Using bacterial-dependent factors, DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles.This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined resources to access IBM's cloud services, as well as the cloud-based resources of Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have adverse effects or side effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond prevention.
Another random outbreak in Australia is due to slow out of 4,170 active healthcare settings.
Vaccines in the production phase may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as ACE2 mutant mice, other laboratory animals and primates non-humans, suggests the need for Level 3 biosecurity prevention measures to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standard safety practices.
The SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine for the treatment or prevention of SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
During the outbreak of MERS, the idea was that ongoing research on MERS would likely provide a useful template for developing vaccines and medicines against MERS-CoV infection.
Until March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that had undergone clinical trials in humans in Phase I and three other vaccines that were all viral; two adenoviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA (MVA-MERS-S) vaccine.
Views spread on social media have led to the promotion of conspiracy theories about the well-known COVID-19 virus and the availability of vaccines.
The innovations mentioned in various social media will refer to previous inventions related to genetic sequences and vaccines related to other types of coronavirus such as SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a type of infectious disease that is known to be caused by the acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The general symptoms of a stroke are nausea and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, gluttony, hearing loss, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure to the pathogen and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases will lead to mild symptoms, some cases may be caused by viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases worldwide from 210 countries and territories were reported, with 153,000 of those cases resulting in death.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is transmitted mainly through close contact, often through small droplets caused by coughing, thirst or talking.
Although the dust causes these droplets to spread, droplets usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than passing over long distances.
People may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The probability of infection within the first three days after the onset of symptoms is higher. Of course, there is also the possibility of virus spread before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of disease.
We recommend wearing a mask for people suspected of being infected with the virus and those around them.
Recommendations for wearing a mask vary for the general public; some officials are against the use of masks and some are in favor of it, and some consider wearing a mask mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transmission has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO-covered regions.
People infected with the virus may be symptomless or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, nausea, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms may include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest area, dizziness, difficulty walking and bruising of the face or lips.
Symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract, such as sinusitis, nasal congestion or gludder, have also been observed with less prevalence.
E-rushing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in variable doses.
Some cases in China had only suffered from respiratory distress and severe heartbeat in the early stages.
In others, the disease may persist until the stage of pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and even death.
This period is called the period of the Nafta.
The duration of COVID-19 infection is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms appear within 11.5 days of infection.Reports suggest that not all infected people necessarily have symptoms.
These symptomless carriers in the role of the transmission process are not yet well defined. Of course, preliminary evidence suggests that these individuals may be the cause of the outbreak.
The percentage of people without symptoms is not yet known and is under investigation. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has announced that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stay remain symptomless.
The National Health Commission of China started to include symptomless cases in its statistics on April 1.Of 166 cases of infection on-day, 130 (78%) were symptomless at the time of the test.
Both the mixture and the mixture may be a virus carrier.
Speaking out loud scatters more particles than speaking slowly.
Researchers from Singapore have shown that covering the mouth and nose during vomiting may cause the dissemination of fine droplets up to a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has stated that there is a possibility of airborne transmission and that in air collectors installed in the corridors outside the person's room, the effects of positive RNA samples related to the virus have been observed.
Certain medical procedures such as tubing and cardiorespiratory resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory tract infections to spread and the virus to spread through the air.
Although there are concerns about transmission of the virus through the placenta, this probability has been assumed to be low. The probability of transmission of the virus through symptomatic individuals is higher. The probability of transmission of the virus before symptoms appear is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has announced that despite the unknown transmission mechanism, each person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, the virus survives for one day, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and copper 99% for a maximum of four hours.
Of course, this period also depends on humidity and blood pressure.
The proper use of soap and detergent is also effective.Soap products protect the virus from the spread of fat-protecting fats, disable it, and protect it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chloride (surgical coughing), are less effective.In a study conducted in Hong Kong, the measles samples were taken on average two days after bedtime.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high viral load and in the sixth patient, the highest viral load was seen in the second day trial.
Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a type of novel coronavirus Acute Respiratory Syndrome that was first isolated from three people with pneumonia and related to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All of the symptoms of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in related coronavirus.
The virus is transmitted outside the human body by household soap. The protective soap bubbles are transmitted from the body. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 has the greatest impact on the lungs because the virus is transmitted through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) into the host cell, which is abundant in lung type II stem cells.
The virus uses a specific glycoprotein surface called a "spike" (pollomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of infected people and hospitalized in Wuhan.This problem is more common in severe cases of illness.
The rate at which cardiovascular symptoms occur due to a systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders in the progression of ALS but also acute myocardial injury may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and play a role in heart function.
High rates of thrombosis (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) have been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be linked to poor diagnosis.Exposure of people who died from COVID-19 was a sign of diffuse atrial fibrillation (DAD) and the penetration of lymphocyte-containing inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 is more prone to respiratory ACE2 cell carcinoma, symptoms of severe systemic inflammation have been observed in patients with COVID-19.
In particular, the association of pathogenic GM-CSF-screting T cells with the absorption of IL-6-screting monocytes, inflammation and severe lung pathology has been proven in COVID-19 patients.
Influence of lymphocytes has also been reported during autopsy.
WHO has published several protocols for testing the disease.
The standard diagnostic method is chain reaction polymerase chain reaction reverse momentum (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on breathing samples obtained with a nasopharynx swab. Of course, a nasopharynx swab or mixed sample is also applicable.
Results are usually prepared within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but this requires taking two blood samples at two-week intervals.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a species of coronavirus and release its genetic sequence. Thus, laboratories around the world will be able to conduct continuous chain reaction polymerase (PCR) tests to diagnose viral infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which have the ability to diagnose active infections and a history of infection) were available for study, but have not yet been used extensively.
This Chinese experiment is only 60 to 70% accurate in the field of testing.
The first point of care testing in the United States was approved by the FDA on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University have suggested methods for diagnosing infection based on clinical features and risk epidemiology.
The glass mat coded double-layer multi-lobular with lateral, uneven, and rear-facing distribution is useful for diagnosis in the early stages of infection.
A subcutaneous bulge, a defective coating (a thickening of the tube with variable grain maturity) and a stiffening may be signs of disease progression.
There is no accurate information available about the microscopic and pathophysiological damage caused by COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in the autopsy include:
Microscopy: the genome, precard, heart and breathing stiffness of the human body.
There are four levels of severity of viral pneumonia that are observable:
The mild pneumoniae include respiratory, hyperplastic pneumocytes, unusually large pneumocytes, lymphocytic-inflammatory bowel disease and multi-step cell formation.
Severe pneumonia: a scattered appendix injury (DAD) with scattered appendix secretions.
DAD-factor syndrome is acute respiratory distress disorder (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
The lung is improving: the formation of fillers in the cavities of the cornea and respiratory fibrosis.
Blood: clotting in the intravenous circulatory system (DIC); the reaction is a locuritroblastic reaction.
He pointed out preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection: staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with paper towels when urinating and using the inner part of the ring, if no towels are provided.
Hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is strongly recommended.
The CDC has suggested the use of fabric masks in public places to some extent, to prevent the spread of disease by people without symptoms.Social distancing monks seek to reduce contact with infected individuals with large groups of people by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large crowds.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum of 6 feet (1.8 meters) of distance between individuals.
Since the discovery of a vaccine is not envisaged until at least 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is the effort to reduce the pandemic, or the "flattening" of the curve.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. This is especially necessary after exiting the toilet or having exposed their hands to infection, before eating food and after discharge, vomiting or thirst.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a total alcohol content of at least 60% if soap and water are not available.For areas where hand sanitizers are not available, WHO has provided two formulas for local production.
In this formula, an antimicrobial agent from ethanol or isopropanol is also obtained.
Alcohol is used to remove the high microbial content of proxide hydrogen; it is not an active ingredient in hand sanitization.
Glycerol is added as a moisture preservative.
Individuals are managed with care supporting care that may include fluid-drug, oxygen support and support for other vital organs damaged.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of infection wear simple masks.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat narrow respiratory problems, but its benefits are still being studied.
Individual hygiene, lifestyle changes and family dietary changes are recommended to strengthen safety.
Supportive treatments may be beneficial for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have made recommendations for caring for people who fall asleep due to COVID-19.
Special care professionals and lung specialists in the United States have compiled treatment proposals from various institutions in the form of free resources called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To alleviate symptoms, some medical professionals have diagnosed the use of paracetamol (astaminophen) for first-line consumption as better than ibuprofen.
To minimize the likelihood of transmission of the virus, precautions are necessary, especially in treatment centers where routines that create suspended particles, such as piping or manual ventilation, are carried out.
For medical professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping an individual in the airborne infection quarantine (AIIR) and using standard precautions, contact prevention measures and airborne precautions.The CDC has issued guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Proposed devices include: PPE guns, respiratory or face masks, eye protection and surgical gloves. If available, use of respiratory masks (instead of face masks) is preferred.
The N95 respiratory mask is approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved the use of these masks with the EUA.
The mask is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but its effectiveness against biological agents specific to consumption outside of its original use is not guaranteed.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends the use of a face mask or, as a last resort, a mask for hand-me-downs.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that mechanical ventilation or alternative methods are required, but a number of them require these measures.
Some evidence suggests that conductive flow-on-the-line or positive bi-level pressure in the respiratory tract may prevent piping.
Whether either of these two approaches will result in the achievement of similar benefits in patients is uncertain.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation if available, as this method reduces the amount of radiation exposure compared to the nasal conolate flow.The prevalence of severe cases is higher in older adults (people over 60, and especially people over 80).
In many developed countries, hospital beds are insufficient, and as a result, the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases that require beds is limited.
In a study in China, it was found that 5% of patients in the special care unit are admitted, 2.3% require mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% are uninsured.
In China, about 30% of people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 eventually end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 becomes more severe and oxygen delivery becomes much more difficult.
To maximize oxygen delivery and reduce the likelihood of radiation damage associated with the ventricle and thorax, the use of ventricles with pressure control and high PPEP conditions is essential.
Older wind turbines may not have high PEEP.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir is apparently the most promising among the drugs.
Although the development of new drugs will take until 2021, several of the drugs under test have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
An antiviral drug may be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO has suggested that volunteers participate in trials to assess the efficacy and safety of potential drugs.The FDA has issued a temporary approval for the use of synthetic plasma as a trial treatment; however, in cases where an individual's life is severely or completely at risk.
These drugs have been the subject of clinical studies necessary to prove efficacy and safety associated with disease.
In February 2020, China unveiled a mobile app to manage the trend of outbreaks.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The program can help detect the 'closeest contact' with the help of surveillance data and diagnose the likelihood of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential risk is identified, the program will, in addition to offering a proposal for home quarantine, report the matter to local health authorities.Clan-data analysis on mobile phones, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence have been used to track infected individuals and persons associated with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government made it possible for security agencies to retrieve mobile phone data of people suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
The measure was taken to quarantine and protect people who may have had contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom decided to provide the Robert Köh Institute, a German federal government agency, with data on the location of telephone calls to provide research on the trend of the spread of the virus and its prevention.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify individuals who have been quarantined.
Giulio Gallera, regional health official in Italy, has been informed by mobile phone operators that 40% of people continue to move freely.
The German government's Hackathon held a 48-hour e-ra this weekend with over 42,000 people attending.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, the President of Estonia, issued a call to attract creative measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection may cause people to become anxious.
Rory O'Connor was quoted by the BBC as saying: "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental stress and economic problems can alter a person's mental and physical well-being".
The disease may be symptomatic or symptomless at some stage and manifests itself as a result of complications such as other common diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract, such as colds.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but recovery in people with severe or acute illnesses may take three to six weeks.
Based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be among the most at-risk groups for COVID-19 infection; of course, no data on COVID-19 is available.In some people, COVID-19 may slow the lung and cause pneumonia.
In the most vulnerable individuals, COVID-19 may quickly turn into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cause shortness of breath, shock infection or multi-organ deficiency.
The consequences of COVID-19 can be linked to infection, abnormal blood clotting and heart, kidney and liver failure.
Blood clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, have been observed in 6% of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
In about 20-30% of people with COVID-19, there have been signs of increased liver enzyme filtration (trans aminase).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five days from which to connect to the bed.
Of course, in patients admitted to the ICU, the average interval between bedtime and death has been reported to be seven days.
Recent studies have shown that the average time between the onset of initial symptoms and death was 14 days, with the full range reported being from six to 41 days.
Studies by China's National Health Commission (NHC) found that the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
Tissue-to-cancerous examinations of samples of the lungs of dead individuals showed scattered pollen lesions and cell fibromycoxide fillers in both lungs.
Cytopathic viral changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image was similar to that of a lung with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, an increase in troponin levels or heart attack was caused by cardiac arrest.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of people in bed have been pre-existing illnesses.Access to medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of deaths from the disease due to regional differences as well as cognitive difficulties vary.
A low number of mild cases may cause overestimated death rates.
Of course, the fact that deaths were the result of previous infections may mean that the mortality rate and current mortality rates have been minimized.
Smokers, compared to non-smokers, are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to require special care or diet.
The Hong Kong hospital administration's report noted that the lung capacity in some people recovered from the disease and the presence of signs of organ damage in lung scans would decrease by 20 to 30 percent.
This condition may lead to a special post-control syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not clear whether a history of infection caused effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity, based on the speed of other coronaviruses, is tolerated, but in some cases the test result for coronavirus in people recovering from COVID-19 has also been positive.
It is believed that these cases are caused by a severe infection that has been hidden away and not re-infected.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, transmitted through a viral infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the outbreak of this infection was almost completely based on human-to-human transmission.
After reviewing 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in the January 2020 issue of The Lancet, the first cases of symptoms will return on 1 December 2019.
The official publications of WHO have announced the date of the first cases of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
For the measurement of mortality, different criteria are usually used.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of health systems, treatment options, the time elapsed from the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 or pandemic-free SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the laboratory.
According to the Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 17, 2020, the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This number varies by region. From other sensory scales, the mortality rate (CFR) can be indicated, which is the percentage of people diagnosed with myerand disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a particular population from the infection stage to the case closure.
Although not all infected individuals necessarily produce the antibodies, the presence of the antibodies may provide information about the number of infected individuals.
In the small village of 4600 inhabitants Castiglione d'Adda, the most common outbreak of the virus in Italy, 80 tons (1.7%) died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through Carnival festivals.Infected youths caused a relatively low mortality rate.However, some cases of COVID-19 deaths have been officially listed in the death category from the virus.
Meanwhile, the German healthcare system has maintained its self-efficacy.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, based on the assessment of blood donors, may have produced antibodies.
69 confirmed deaths (0.004% of the population) have been recorded from COVID-19.
The impact of this pandemic and the mortality rate on women and men varies.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality and mortality rates among men were reported to be higher.
The highest risk of developing it is in men over the age of 50, and this gap between women and men over the age of 90 is closing.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The reasons for this gender difference are not clear, but genetic and behavioral factors may still be influential.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower incidence of smoking among women, and higher incidence of men having similar diseases such as high blood pressure, at a lower age than women may play a role in higher mortality rates among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not taken any measures to withhold gender-related data regarding COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher percentage of the treatment staff, especially nurses, are female and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that COVID-19 had been chosen as the official name for the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, President of the WHO, announced that CO is the surname of Corona, VI is related to virus, D is the acronym for disease and 19 is related to the time of first detection: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (such as China), animal species or groups of individuals, based on international naming proposals and with the aim of preventing labeling.The virus that causes COVID-19, coronavirus 2, is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the title Covid-19 and Covid-19-causing viruses in official communications.
The disease and the virus that causes it are collectively called the coronavirus.
In the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the names coronavirus and coronavirus in Wuhan were given together as a virus and disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization considered 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the disease, which were chosen in accordance with the 2015 guidelines on avoiding naming places for naming viruses and diseases.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are moving to produce sanitary items such as nose swabs and device parts.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital with a Soup device needed a hoarsan and the supplier could not provide it on time.As a result, a local startup needed reverse engineering and production of 100 Soup at night.
After the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and insufficient information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease took shape and quickly spread online.
Apparently, the virus is transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies involving finding evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens have not been successful.
No drug or vaccine has been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is underway among governmental organizations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization implemented the Critical Unit to assess the effectiveness of treatment of the four existing antiviral compounds that are most promising.
There is no vaccine yet, but various institutions are actively investigating proposed vaccines.
Results from previous SARS-CoV studies are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
The vaccine strategy is currently under investigation.
First, researchers are working on developing a perfect virus vaccine.
The use of viruses, passive or dead, to prevent the onset of an immune response in the human body to a new infection with COVID-19 is done.
The second strategy, single-sub-vaccine, is to build a vaccine that can slow the immune system's sensitivity to certain virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research is based on the protein Spike S, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 receptor enzyme.
The third strategy is related to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of vaccine production).
The trial vaccines of each of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus.Protectant-based development has been proposed as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but there is debate in this area.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical internships have been active.
Seven clinical trial practitioners evaluated therapies that had been previously approved for the treatment of malaria, from which four research methods could be indicated for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs involving altered application are the subject of most Chinese research, with the results of Phase III trials on remdesivir to be announced in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and proposed medicines is underway.Several antiviral drugs available for the treatment of COVID-19 are under review, of which remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta synthesis can be indicated.
As of March 2020, there was unconfirmed evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients who were treated with remdesivir without a prescription.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Cloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 and its preliminary results were published.
Of course, researchers from the community are invited to review these results.
Health authorities in Korea and China have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while suggesting a daily intake of one gram, has stated that taking twice the dose is very dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA approved emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, with the advice of doctors who treat people with COVID-19.In the version 7 China manual, the name interferon, ribavirin or ome venever is proposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high-dose ribavirin consumption is essential to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory environment.
Nitasoxanide, after the effectiveness of low-on concentrations in inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was proven, was proposed for research in the human body.Research has shown that the preparation of a primary protein spike with serine protease transducer 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/without azithromycin has major limitations that the medical community has been preventing from accepting these treatments without reviewing them. Oseltamivir in a laboratory setting does not inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been proven.
Cytocin may be severe from the effects of the later stages of COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine has anti-storm cytokine properties. National Health Commission China Tochelisumab is included after a brief review in the treatment guidelines.
After taking the drug in people with severe illness left positive results, it was found to be in Italy under a randomized phase 2 trial at the national level.
Combining serum ferritin blood tests to identify the cytokine storm, it is also used to counteract the development that has been declared the cause of death of some people with the disease.
The FDA approved the antagonist receptor interloquin-6 in 2017 based on past case studies for the treatment of cytokine-resistant liberation syndrome, which is also caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, no randomized, controlled evidence based on the effectiveness of tokylizumab for CRS treatment has been presented.
Pure, dense antibodies produced in the immune system of people recovered from COVID-19 are being studied as a non-vaccine-to-infective immunization method of transmission to people in need.
This strategy was tested for SARS and the results were not conclusive.
Viral neutralization is a possible mechanism of this process, which according to the anti-antimicrobial inactivity provides a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms, such as cytotoxic cytokines attached to the pathogen and/or phagocytes, may be effective.
Other types of inactivated antibodies, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under investigation.
Serum production, which includes the liquid portion of blood taken from recovered individuals and contains specific antibodies to the RA virus, may be increased for faster development.
Diseases caused by coronavirus, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from an infection with COVID-19 and after being made public about the spread of the virus.
