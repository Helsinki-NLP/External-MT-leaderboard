Barack Obama becomes fourth US president to win the Nobel Peace Prize
The American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth American President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, medal and a cheque for $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy the whole time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five members of the committee who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The President and the President have scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit culminates with the ceremony at which Obama receives the prestigious award.
He is the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive it directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be speaking about the war in Afghanistan when he receives the award.
The president doesn't want to shy away from this topic because he knows he's taking the prize as a president who's currently at war in two countries.
The war effort has been intensified by the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan a few days ago, which none of his critics forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, in which the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will be present, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway.
Obama was very reserved about the price from the start.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeatedly stated that the prize was not just for him, but for all those who share his values.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this was a "call to action".
Conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizen association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he appealed against some construction proceedings last year, and demanded money from investors in his favour to have his appeals withdrawn, said Leitmeritz police spokeswoman Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leading Conservation Society is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting bins in Brno don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort their beverage packaging, and in the villages of southern Moravia, they can find sorting bins for trash again.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate trash cans.
I'm not saying that the waste separation in Brno wouldn't work at all.
But I think that the Council is not taking enough care of this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste-separation race in the Urwald League, not only because we as citizens here are allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in sorting containers, but above all by the number of waste bins for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection bin?
It's an art, it takes time and nerve.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the moorland opposite the affected goose.
Mr Onderka and his colleagues are not to be offended, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honeycomb in other parts.
That's why a whole bunch of my friends don't sort the garbage.
I was lazy.
It's too far for them to go to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the ceremony.
But on Konicova Street, I didn't see any paint trash cans in sight.
Luckily, I came to the right place on the tram.
The garbage was almost running over.
This is still the centre of Brno, representing the whole city, right?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics will probably discourage the Brno Socialists.
They'd rather buy the city an ice hockey league that embarrasses us all in the Republic than buy a few more trash cans and offer to sort more raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and building savings.
But neither do interest on the national debt nor on international litigation.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for wage increases for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or medical benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems for the future, a mine lie", says Janota.
Loans are paying higher and higher interest rates, and you have to pay back the money at some point.
Too many choices to take from, the treasury is empty.
If social benefits or costs for the state are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those who have been given more money by the Left Party now: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or the sickness benefit, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the cost of the state's further indebtedness, next year the state treasury will be short of not only 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise more and more rapidly, and with it the costs and interest.
The State will need the money for compensation, and it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT just a little or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
The Commission has not yet decided on the budget for the next year.
These are mainly the sections won in competition, which can no longer be re-designed and possibly made cheaper.
At most, you get what's not free.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of road accidents.
The CSSD has proposed that it would solve the money outflow in a Solomonic way - it would attack the dividends on CEZ shares, where the State is the majority owner, and then distribute the money from these to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the CEZ contributed 18 billion to the budget.
The dividends are used annually to pay environmental damage payments, to replenish the pension account and to provide a reserve for the planned pension reform.
The trick also increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP according to EU rules.
But that is not the end of the carnival of upheaval.
The budget for various compensation schemes for victims of communism and crime, or for legal expenses, even for building savings, was cut by almost three billion.
Whether the state can survive without this money is uncertain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The Minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government's budget reserve.
The Commission is also concerned about the lack of funds for the two-billion-dollar project already under way, the "State Treasury", which is designed to monitor online spending by individual authorities.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and in that case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will be powered by two operating systems.
The Americans expect the future to be a mobile phone where the user can switch between different operating systems with the press of a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
All you have to do is press a button, and Windows Mobile will be Android in a matter of seconds.
This is the opportunity that the American company VMware, which focuses on developing virtual software for computers, wants to introduce.
We're enabling you to run two user profiles on your phone at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware suggested in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It's coming on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists the smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM running the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to be delivered to customers within 2012.
Snow shortage in the mountains is plaguing hotel owners
Scneelless slopes are not just a concern for the Giant Mountain people.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter holidays including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, they fix the prices, but now they're afraid to make a commitment.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be snowing or "on the mud", said Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve at the Spindlemill exactly as you want, you should not hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of your stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer only weekday stays for New Year's Day.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give in, too, and settle for shorter terms.
And then the empty rooms will quickly dwindle, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
We still have about half the seats available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said Petr Schiefert, director of the travel agency Ingtours.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available.
Good sales are also found on the first fourteen days of February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains is also a negative influence on the interest in winter stays.
People are waiting for snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed in a week, Schiefert thinks Christmas will be sold out.
On the contrary, and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou are occupied.
We are about five per cent better than last year.
We only have a few rooms available on New Year's Day and Christmas.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and business will be good in February, said Karel Rada, director of the best Pec hotel.
The hotel Omnia in the central parking lot of Janske Lazne is also 80 per cent occupied for New Year's Eve stays.
But at Christmas, half the beds at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne are still available.
We were pleasantly surprised this January, when we were already about 60 percent occupied.
February is a little weaker now, but the moment the snow comes, interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia Hotel.
The owners of the Giant Mountains hotels are now waiting for a bigger snow shelter.
Thursday should cool off, and if it rains, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, the climate is expected to warm again, said Jiri Jakubsky of the Czech Meteorological Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost strange how Barack Obama, the president who is known as the smartest, is repeating the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghanistan issue, whom he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally expressed his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it down on the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward", without hesitation.
He himself criticized the Bush idea three years ago of sending fresh troop contingents to civil war-torn Iraq as "irresponsible and disastrous in its consequences".
But the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible one and was so successful that Iraq is no longer mentioned in the news.
The Bushs' reputation has not been improved by this, for objectively he has left his successor in a much more grateful starting position than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
The military has again asked him to increase the contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinationist habits, has been harshly critical of the stuttering gunmen in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to turn the situation around.
The president hesitated for three months, but couldn't come up with a better idea, so he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed for the promise of another 5,000, although he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of the Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete the process in three years.
Some doubt that the halving of the increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the recent civil war, Iraqi society is relatively well structured, and its leaders respect the values.
The situation in Afghanistan is one of contraindications - no one can be trusted and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally correctly established, remain mere shell structures, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the confusion of the situation, which complicates the Pakistani and Iranian influences even further.
The construction of a 'performing state', which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
The timeline of Obama's strategy alienated by his volunteerism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Only a truly romantic soul, unimpressed by facts, can believe that the little soldiers who have broken out in the war cry of "early homecoming" are creating a miracle here.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is a complete irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take this as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is waning.
The European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is connected with the war in the Hindukush foothills.
Another possible factor that could radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will face a very difficult question as to whether the problem cannot be solved by troops.
That question must be answered in the period of time that America is moving forward from Obama to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to go before the presidential election, and that there is enough time for him to adopt a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Goldman Sachs no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
This was announced by the company in response to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top executives will receive stock instead of money, but they will not be allowed to sell it for five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is leading the way in linking Wall Street's premiums with long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I think Wall Street is aware of the broader direction it has to go in, said former JPMorgan corporate banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire for saving nearly $17 billion in bonus bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars, according to Reuters, despite the measure announced today.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become the most hotly debated political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-time tax of 50 percent on bank bonuses in excess of £25,000.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five women who have set records have taken this year's Nobel Prizes in the disciplines and in literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm today.
Besides the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize in chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work in elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of the Economic Report.
The only subject in which no woman won a Nobel Prize that year was physics.
The prize was awarded to Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and to George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and the certificate of the acquisition of the prize money.
The amount is 10 million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the prize money is divided among them.
Traditionally, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the American President, Barack Obama, this afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversies of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and he is also at the head of a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in keeping with his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to achieve world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning.
President Vaclav Klaus receives Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering staying in government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form approved by the Parliament on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
Klaus is also criticizing the budget.
He said the budget deficit was too high, which further deepened the public finance crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday about whether he will stay in office.
The budget law,which Klaus is now signing, is to see the Czech Republic run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment, which is to be adopted by the Council on 1 January.
The government has resisted the proposals of the Social Democrats to increase the budget deficit covertly.
The left-wing party and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, have thus been embroiled in a sharp internal political dispute, raising questions about the future work of the Fischer-Officials' Cabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, effectively liquidates the austerity package imposed by the Fischer government in the autumn, which they believe is intended to end the public debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the state budget law, said at a discussion breakfast with businessmen today that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
The only way to improve the situation is to have a strong government, which can build on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is terrible and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servants' cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek's words that the budget deficit that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year was terrible, and that it exceeded 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, the CSSD already rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country's struggle and victory despite some criticism that the lead role was played by an American actor.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid system of government in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in the box office hit Eastwood drama "Million Dollar Baby", has already played the leader of the abolitionist movement who ended up as a slave owner, a fictional U.S. president, and a god in "Evan the Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the country's president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unconquered", and it is also the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film depicts a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new president Mandela knows that his people still remain divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
Finally, the South African team qualifies for the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in a way that brought it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
It's important to me to be a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in the film where the white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, it opened, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, under the direction of director Eastwood, "Invictus: Undefeated" has received positive reviews and is also rumored to win an Oscar.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his assessment in these words: "It was a very good story, a very well executed film".
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
Russia tests missile: Norway's lightning rod is uncovered
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, and the so-called Bulava missile, originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for the Russian general staff and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Nor did his repeated presence on the ground during the missile tests have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers are already writing about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This is the 13th attempt, and it was normal at first.
It was only at the end of the flight that the missile suffered technical damage.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time, the Bulava took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was underwater in the White Sea.
This missile type allows the launch from the submarine.
So it's likely that the mysterious light caused by an unidentified flying object over the northern hemisphere was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted from the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The general public has been careful this time and has claimed that it is impossible to speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the missile failed and the accident affected only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even though no test launch was without fail, the Department of Defense's leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success rate therefore fills the general public with optimism, and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defenceman Vyaceslav Fetisov is back in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner is helping his team CSKA Moscow out of trouble, and will probably be competing in the KHL's Friday duel against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas' injury, we need another defensive player.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clear up some of the remaining formalities, the AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov as saying.
It is not clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will be limited to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, said Nemchinov.
When Fetisov gets back on the ice, he'll be the oldest Russian professional hockey player, according to the AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe, at age 51, played a full season for Hartford, recording 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union dress he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also had success in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit dress.
He's been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has given in to the unions.
The management of the Nosovice Hyundai Automobile Factory agreed with the union to the abolition of all overtime.
The union has announced the strike on Monday because of frequent overtime.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for Hyundai Motor Company, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production schedule, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed on the grounds that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive this afterwards for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
They can either get paid the overtime pay or take a replacement leave on December 28 to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts are paid for their fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning issue in the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
The workers at the car factory had been forced to work two more hours after the eight-hour shift practically every day until last week.
The agreement will be signed with the union's intention to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the car factory and the trade unionists are to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfillment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike preparedness.
The situation in the car factory reached a peak last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 workers spontaneously went on strike for continuous overtime.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management was opposed to the employees having to work overtime to meet the demand for automotive supplies.
The trade unions also called for no sanctions on the workers who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, the unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime.
In addition, they demand the payment of the fee of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Hyundai car factory now employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production in November last year.
By September this year, some 80,000 vehicles had been produced here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on 'stolen' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on common virus variants as any of the drugs already available.
AIDS is not curable.
But the combination of drugs can prolong the life of patients and prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
But taking them is accompanied by a whole host of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus replication has also led to the development of resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to tackling virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances known as metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metal carbores are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus from multiplying in a way that is different from any drug used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists are developing new 'improved' compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metal carbores have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cages made of boron, hydrogen, and carbon atoms, linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-grown and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus' growth in the patient's body, explain the scientists in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CR Academy of Sciences.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances on HIV proteases were tested in the test tube, including against their resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the case of the medicinal products used in clinical trials, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of further chemical formation, make metallocarbons interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
The budget dispute.
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrible" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS's statement as "strong statements".
It's supposed to leave time for analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil servants' cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament to fight the growing deficit or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday,but with changes from the Left Party worth more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democrats to increase the budget deficit covertly.
The Czech Republic was to run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the Government's wish, because the amended budget is also only a less bad version of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and Meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, expressed disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government was still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were accepted, the situation would have been different.
According to Czech TV, Janota has reported to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering continuing in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
In so far as Fischer is in favour of continuing the fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Social Democrats (CSSD) who had pushed through the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing laws, such as those on sickness benefits and pensions or the Labour Code.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
It mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy positions who are committed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the high level of public finances deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he cannot supposedly count on the support and tolerance of the Citizen Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is going to be relevant, I will deal with it, said Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, to journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for the European Council meeting.
The ODS withdrew at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister specifically asked the Citizens' Democrats to allow the budget to pass.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he said when asked whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
I knew when I gave up the mandate that in the next few months it would be mainly about bolshevising the parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
The new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways) will see fewer trains running for about the same fare.
The Czech railways will terminate or restrict some less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other services will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from the date of entry into force of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and passenger fares, will remain unchanged.
For example, the residents of the Ostrava area are provided with several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava (Pressburg).
The number of high-speed trains will also be reduced on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route, and direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced in principle.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), totalling eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tabor-Budweis route will also be cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
The most important changes are the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, which means that the inhabitants of Milovice are now forced to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, which is being opened thanks to the electrification of the Lysa nad Labem to Milovice railway.
The long-distance services to the capital will end at the Prague Central Station.
The CD introduces more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at intervals of two hours.
Passengers on the pendolino have not been able to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's regional railway bill: 200 million increase
The speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and the railway will receive a total of 4 billion crowns next year to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss, just as it did this year.
This year, regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
The railway has renewed a ten-year contract for local and express trains, which has so far been for only one year.
The railway praises the system, which is perhaps why it has not increased the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes are only for CD Net one-day tickets and eLiska discount internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the route taken, until now it was uniform for travel between any county towns and cost 160 kroner.
Filipino militants arrest more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Today, militants kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only about 65 abductions.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a live shield to escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now working to extradite the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police were pursuing the kidnappers because of the violence, which demanded retaliation between the two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a lawsuit was filed over the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the governorship election, were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the powerful Ampatuan clan, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman, aka Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" will be released in American cinemas, which includes a part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
The film's release has been met with a mixed reaction from critics and the public.
The President
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakhar Prize, and in 1993 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was elected President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Expectations are high for the film because it will be released at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the World Cup, while the media is shaking the world with alarming news of rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the Associated Press, the reaction to the new film in South Africa is generally positive for now, despite many reservations about casting American Hollywood stars in the lead roles.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new movie, in his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for years and I've prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person, so that I could, as they say, receive his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival.
I think it's good that we can use this film to remind us of Mandela and his message.
This is a South African story, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team uniform
The film, based on the book by British writer John Carlin, loosely translated as 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman tries to bring together two racial and for years and days mutually segregated population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters his role in the South African National Rugby Championship on the World Cup field, which South Africa won at that time.
For his walk on the lawn in a dress, which is almost considered a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela won a standing ovation from the white public 14 years ago, and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
Rugby may be able to bring people back together as one people, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But white South Africans are skeptical, as recently revealed in an interview for LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers are burning for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out this morning at the Ceps transformer in the switchboard near Vyskov in the Louny region.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units responded to the fire.
The fire department originally wanted to burn the transformers, but later changed their minds and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, and the accident did not endanger the safety of the wiring system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, the damage will be more accurate after the fire.
Mandatova says the damaged transformer needs to be replaced with a new one.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances and radiation is not yet in force.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to Sona Holingerova, spokeswoman for CEZ for North Bohemia, and the fire at the substation did not affect the functioning of households, public authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, which transmit electrical energy in a distribution system and pipeline length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura is filing criminal charges for defamation against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today charging three Social Democratic leaders with defamation.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute interview in the Radiojournal.
The action relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all the regions have signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking the raisins out, and we have only made the offer to the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claim we're more expensive than the Czech railways because we'd know the prices of the Czech railways that were finalized last week.
Then we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency Society, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge against the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I will ask other officials to do the same.
I assume that this matter will also make it clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public and using false and untrue arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising that will point to the districts' adverse move.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and would continue it after New Year's.
He made it clear that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed with the Czech Railways to operate regional rail services and did not call for tender for the 150 billion crown contract.
Vancura said that such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
The Commission has not yet received any comments from the Commission on the measures taken by the French authorities to combat the spread of the virus.
The only threat was that if we didn't give up, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, his name I will not say, Jancura told the Radiojournal today.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococcal disease
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease is changing the habit from January.
It is to be the first for families to be free and voluntary.
But there are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal disease are at a high point.
The Institute of Medicines already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurers must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children born on or after 2 August last year can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for further re-vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the third and fifth month of the child' s life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of youngest children.
In all, experts estimate that health insurance spends between 300,000 and 450,000 kroner a year on vaccines.
But they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all the surface vaccinations of children.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infections, but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
In the United Kingdom, pneumoconiosis infections are responsible for the deaths of up to 28 children under the age of 10 each year.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination may become mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, it will be paid for by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahla citizens' association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference our association was involved in were not very happy that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in at least doing that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky pointed out.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At the moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors claim.
The president of the Society of Pediatric Practitioners, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then we could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations. "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one", says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal disease by next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination to be paid for by the health insurance and not by the State.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so that they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
But this is a concern of the practical paediatricians, who are concerned about the procurement of vaccines.
The original plan was that the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies and then received by doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the government.
Some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "take out the money from the health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay for them.
It is estimated that each practitioner will have to invest 40,000 kroner a month, which is a considerable sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It's been reported that Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used a dredger to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayal of characters like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Jr. claimed he was instructed by his father "to break into the museum by any means necessary to get all the paintings into storage".
The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied giving any permission.
Labour defends pay and tax increases
The Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "blinded" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social security
The unions protested that low-wage workers were being punished for a recession they did not cause, and warned of impending "problems".
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, even though the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect some 10 million workers.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the application of the rules on the free movement of goods.
Increase of social security by a further 0,5% from April 2011
This year, the economy shrank by more than expected 4.75 %
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of state pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 poorer per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
The ministers said their target of deficit reduction by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of the additional taxes would fall on the top 5% of earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and spending cuts outlined were "a drop in the bucket" compared with the measures needed.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us deficit reduction and this is also a vital need over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's predictions of future economic growth  affecting the volume of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction  were called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy was likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% fall predicted in April - while the debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who are to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis", said the planned £789 billion debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan for how they would repay this and were "cynically" pressing ahead with difficult decisions until after the election - which must be held by June 2010 at the latest.
"They have not said anything of significance about what they will do", said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do so and they passed it by".
"The major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte, and the other
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police should be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservative proposals, which see deficit reduction coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained from the tax increases and spending cuts will be used to cover next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some things at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April - would expose the Chancellor to the charge of vote-grabbing, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hole budget" is a good one.
Although ministers have not released details of budgets beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The accredited Institute for Tax Research said the Treasury Chancellor's figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later", said its director, Robert Chote.
"The big announcements are made after the election, whoever wins", added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser at the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report.
FBI investigating "arrest of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspected extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said they're investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US State Department said they were also looking for information on the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges against them and the circumstances under which they are being detained", spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are indeed the missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said local police had been interested in the house before and no charges had been filed against the men arrested.
Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but said the United States must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been for the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison, and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance of criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession" is a good one.
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged for "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
Five days later, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half-unconscious, Amnesty said.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container at a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but said the mandate and power of these bodies was unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski hanging was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform a landmark in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders, who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the hill in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-meter hill.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the hill was beautiful, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the city lights glittering underneath.
He added: "They are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - some real talent".
Prizes were awarded for the best artwork or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a ban on minarets and concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most allegedly secularised societies  and are integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and argumentative study of a contentious issue that has divided and occupied the country for decades and a half and whose impact is still felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide what Bowen calls "Islamic spaces" for the five to six million Muslims in France.
He is a good listener, he re-enacts debates between teachers and students about the questions that most trouble them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media deal with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom have a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed by Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts  supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia  which today has a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a deal requires both sides to give and take.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate about the separation of church and state) feel truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the screw" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, you're inclined to say, "Yes, but not yet".
The most bleak prospect in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can survive nowhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice".
In his diary, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in the hunt for polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old admiral at sea, fighting only with the barrel of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century showed 75 polar bears performing at one performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life span of a wild old animal, and the climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has been turned all green by the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians, often returning to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Inuit motor-sledders use powerful assault rifles to track their prey.
Ironically, the waters north of these two hunting nations will hold the longest ice.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a fascinating insight into how the future might unfold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanatory efforts.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century gave the first hint of the vortexing of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the displaced beam when submerged.

"In a few months... it could be us".
Marines were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington
Major De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women whose footsteps they have followed.
In a few months, wherever we're being brought back from, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company, a manufacturer of wreaths in Harrington, Maine, started this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
It's an 18-year-old tradition now, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, on the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the second time to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made the sacrifices.
She said it's a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from World War I, World War II and Vietnam because they are not visited as often as the newer ones, according to the organizers.
The atmosphere was cheerful, with children playing and couples holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the recent wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved into stone, while others bent down to read small black-and-white plaques that had been put in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears at her son's grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Petty Officer David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"When I'm long gone, I want someone to remember him".
US government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold cell phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not been identified so far, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the U.S. Embassy in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been released, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on the charge of "threatening".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writing, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who frequently describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro-brothered communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will reciprocate if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average government employee earns $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone this year, which is used mainly for texting, since a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wages.
Internet access is extremely restricted on the island.
It's available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government offices, like universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
It's rare to arrest an American in Cuba.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - giving away free cell phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of Human Rights Watch, which recently released a tough report on freedom in Cuba titled "New Castro, Equal to Cuba", a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at a time when both countries are moving towards greater willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hope the case could help expose a vast network of terrorist recruiters who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent known as Saifullah who had invited the men to Pakistan after tracking them down for making comments on the Internet video site YouTube approving of terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men upon their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains of the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the government official, who wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were not discouraged at all and continued to try to get the right referrals to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and being questioned by the FBI - highlights the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to harbor human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers, not letting in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special screening by al Qaeda, analysts said.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, a US-based think tank, said that in recent years, terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to, because the US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more Internet-based.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday, demanding that the negotiators at the Bella Convention Center in the city take bold action on climate change.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little was happening at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city with banners that read in English "There is no Planet B", and one in Spanish that declared "The Earth says 'Enough.'
Some celebrities joined the protest, such as Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that her trips to Peru, her mother's birthplace, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the already palpable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited at demonstrations.
According to a bystander who did not want to be named because he is involved in climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes set off several explosive devices near Copenhagen's main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They dropped them near buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were then followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the minds of key officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international thinking, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't aware of".
He continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is so big, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent race gaps
The math test scores last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although Washington County still lags behind the nation's top-performing schools, the evidence shows that fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of Washington D.C. white fourth graders rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) over the past two years, but their African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, dropping by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
The gap between white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the scores of the children in both groups have increased over this period, the gap has hardly narrowed to 58 points.
Some district education advocates expressed concern last week that the results, celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were driven by mostly white students who are already high-achieving kids.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in Washington, D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a two- or three-point range, said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city's middle schools are in urgent need of attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we're not spending nearly as much time and energy as we would have to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of underperforming students.
For example, this autumn some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets pupils in the upper grades of primary and secondary school who did not have basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their classmates.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on play and life experiences from kindergarten through sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former superintendent Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work on the best measures to benefit the students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the underperforming schools needed to close the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies city test scores.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools that are in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The aim could have political repercussions against this important item on the agenda.
The weakness, of course, is, as with other city school inspectors, that she tries to keep the middle class white and black.
Our focus is to make sure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the suburbs so that all families, wherever they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to closing the achievement gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to almost 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year to add 185 days a year, which he sees as a "milestone" on the way to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future
The coach arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude, and that of the other eighth graders in the group exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was more that of a reverent visitor than that of an enthusiastic prospective student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when told of the school's low student-to-professor ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the kids visited on their three-day tour, and now they've fully grasped the intended message: It's not a question of whether you go to college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the United States who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who are receiving the college education needed to move up the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college, which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the nation's workforce.
Those who study high-achieving children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get into college, especially if these efforts continue over a long period of time.
When you look at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, then one single measure at a time won't solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from pre-school through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP -- turn one gear up -- and it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to start college-preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60 percent of whom have gone on to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to convince major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions that were completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renewal of Iraq's oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid was the short one.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-saturated representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There won't be any more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability following the US military's withdrawal, have likely deterred American oil companies from increasing their involvement in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude oil reserves, analysts said.
In some cases, US firms were at a disadvantage because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to be accountable to shareholders.
ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could sign contracts with the Department.
Large US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have been left with nothing.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the great economic powers of the world as well as a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
The bids were made by companies pre-selected for the bidding, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top Al Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile strike along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top Al Qaeda operational planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials reported Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a senior member of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a series of rockets that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in the illegal tribal belt of Pakistan.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents, suspected of being militants, rushed to the scene and quickly took whatever was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials provided inconclusive evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading Al Qaeda military planner, directing terrorist groups' operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wished to remain anonymous, pointing to the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
If you take his central role for granted, that included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of al-Qaeda and turned them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained good links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but that in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If confirmed dead, Somali would be the second senior Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has dropped since the summer, according to a summary from the Long War Journal, a nonprofit website, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
UN chief envoy in Kabul to resign
The UN's top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term of office marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The oath of office comes as the Obama administration decides to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed his concern that the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Oide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Oide said that he was not resigning but was only fulfilling an agreement he made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN of the
I would like to see the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forwarded now so that he has time to find a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, said Oide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun to look for a replacement, according to UN officials.
UN officials say he has considered the Swedish-Italian Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
His position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Oide denied all the allegations, but he also said that the accusations against Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international election interference".
Oide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the U.S.-led military relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Oide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring arrangements had undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is a disaster and we can't let it continue.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a seven-day trip through the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq, downplaying the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that's bothering me is, if we've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability of war".
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" under the sanctions.
In a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, for its nuclear program.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should be acquired only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks on curbing its nuclear programme and renounce a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have abandoned the negotiations on the interim agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community on its feet on some proposals that they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way they never have in connection with major additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31st as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crushing sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it called "baseless and unfounded claims" by some members of the Security Council on Thursday about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it was ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki this morning before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly over borders, property rights and the sharing of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delays in U.S. plans to reduce the U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to allay Kurdish concerns about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you".
A change of course in an ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that told them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
They've learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who were suddenly hit by low birth rates and an aging population this summer, began to change course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "Absolutely not".
We've already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, spoiled, single children, affectionately called "little emperors", the country is experiencing a population crisis.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared with 6 when this policy was introduced, according to the UN, and the average birth rate has fallen to 1.
The Department of Population Affairs has determined that the number of people aged 60 and over is projected to increase exponentially from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's reported population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the population aging and alleviate the labor shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden", she said.
Gradual Relaxation
Enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have credited this policy with avoiding critical use of the country's natural resources, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to have an abortion.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of males to females.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife had single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters instructing families to have only one child were almost overnight replaced by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has sent out city officials and family planning volunteers to visit couples at their homes and to place leaflets under doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial counselling for those with more than one child.
The response was not particularly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing Reaction
Although officials from a small rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in couples seeking a second child after the campaign began, urban districts reported no change.
For example, the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai's Caolu Municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
She said they want to give their first child the best.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that this is also legally permissible.
But like many Chinese, they have only a modest amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we're being robbed of the ability to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply one of policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the personnel manager, said that she wanted only one child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we do not really want to".
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said so bluntly.
For middle-class parents with dual careers, which is causing the birth rate to drop, he said, it's about being successful and being selfish.
The group of people now aged 20 to 39 grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China's capitalism experiment, and they certainly don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the parents' time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You need to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "By the time the child is nine months old, you already have a resume ready for the best preschools".
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference - which has so far been marked by wild poses and mutual accusations - set a new focus on Friday with the release of a document that puts forward an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations shouldering the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both identified the remaining obstacles and indicated the way forward.
But it was seen as a major step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world are arriving in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a special UN task force, does not mention the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries to help them cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options on key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be for policymakers to support.
The process is given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, executive director of the Sierra Club of Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement whereby the developed nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, while the larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, these countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave a boost to the talks on Friday by pledging $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from flooding and drought to forest destruction.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks of the previous week.
The US Special Rapporteur on climate change, Todd Stern, has rejected formulations calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions for developed countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if these are not financed by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign a deal without major emerging markets standing up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement that the top US climate negotiator was either lacking in "reason" or "highly irresponsible" in saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China to tackle global warming.
The future economic direction of the great powers is at stake, and fractures have developed both within the developed nations and between the developed and the emerging nations.
The current battle is about saving individual economies as much as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding those with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop into a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, presented a draft treaty of 24 pages early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island nations' offensive "exerted political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now united and demanding action from emerging countries like China and India.
The talks gained new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most outstanding issues must be resolved before the arrival of the Heads of Government in order to reach an agreement.
High-level officials, including Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, got off their planes and raced through the halls of the Bella Center for closed-door meetings and press conferences to file claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people coming in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staging late-night shows making fun of countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts being hand-delivered by hand rather than e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the top, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225km/h train redefines the feeling of Monday
On Monday morning at 5:13 a.m., a whistle will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that will revolutionise British transport.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its blitz from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lady Kelly Holmes will then be travelling to Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, on board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains, and link the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become a vibrant commuter town, commute times could be radically reduced, and switching from air and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still put the brakes on Britain's high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will deliver the report on 30 December, according to Lord Adonis, according to the Times.
This will give him a detailed road map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line, which is to link London with the West Midlands, will run alongside urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a five-metre loop.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within 25 metres of the final track.
HS2 is also to create three options for a larger, north-bound high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in a northeasterly direction to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option", said a railway insider.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open until 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The designs will allow trains to run at speeds of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned to accommodate 400-metre trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 passengers.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operated on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean that a terminal in London would be needed, capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say only St Pancras International or Euston has that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning means that a final decision will not be made until after the general election.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network will have to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing lines north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial tipping point to ensure a shift from air to rail, a stepping stone to the railway revolution.
Taxpayers are coming for a mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative's orangery.
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative MP, has been charging the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons had to live on "meager rations", has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build a oak-framed farmhouse on his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons approved the motions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons Members.
Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fee's Office, a spending control unit of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden, which the plans call "orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Mr Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The Committee cleared him of any irregularities last month after examining his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of £271,406 (€300,000) from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as an MP.
Documents released this week show that by March of last year, Duncan was getting about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage payments.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest rate on Duncan RBS's mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the overall increase was used to finance the withdrawal of £75,000 (EUR 85,000).
The normal non-adjusted RBS rate fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to £1,250 a month in May.
Duncan lost his position as House Leader of the Opposition in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs were "living on meager rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically, working for the state means you have to live on meager rations and be treated like a ****".
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a small share of it.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it".
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May over his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office that this "could be considered an exaggerated demand".
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan's lawn in the shape of a pound sign in protest after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fee's Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase".
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and overriding or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer".
Come, all you devotees, to admire Brighton's beach huts advent calendar
Brighton beach huts have found a new life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for each December day.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were able to see the newest hut every day from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. with free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, cakes filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs chosen so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", with the hat decoration by Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and have exciting celebrations.
The idea for the Beach Lodge Advent Calendar started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express that through our spirituality".
Strong climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, 100,000 according to organisers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which is due to conclude by Friday and could come into force in 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the Climate Conference, said that the growing global mobilization for climate change is contributing to the "political cost" of failure in Copenhagen, as these demonstrations illustrate.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train had passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police immediately and ruthlessly intervened.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, most of them members of the Black Blocs, the extremely violent splinter groups that made their name at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were detained "indiscriminately", noting that about a hundred of them "were still being held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold, handcuffed and in a sitting position.
The rather peaceful train left the Parliament and headed for the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get inside.
A stage was installed to welcome the speakers for a candlelit evening attended by former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were also present.
Some 3,000 people, most of you in sky blue raincoats, made your first rally in Copenhagen this morning, as you responded to the Friends of the Earth call to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we take to the streets to demand environmental redress for the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say: 'We have time,'" said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are drying up, waterways where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of critics of globalization has moved closer to environmental organizations.
José Bové, MEP, a figurehead of the globalist critics, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are located and particularly vulnerable to warming, has given the start to the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, marching in red and waving bandanas in which you were celebrating solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada, several hundred people marched to demand a vigorous response to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network gathered several hundred people in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces it as a "putsch".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist Georgian region as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polls closed, according to the Abkhaz election commission officials.
The first preliminary results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital city of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch with Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are all over this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, prepared a warm welcome for the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, in reference to Moscow's support, particularly in the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, including the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding deal from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, on standby, arrested some 700 people on the sidelines of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which until December 18 will receive delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
The peaceful train was marching from the Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to break in.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for a candlelight reception, attended by former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed all in black and armed with bricks and hammers began smashing windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police immediately surrounded you and intervened without mercy by throwing some of you to the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the 'Black Blocs', these extremely violent splinter groups which already made their name at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
Last night, during the incidents, which police said led to the preliminary arrest of about 20 people, a policeman suffered a jaw injury from a paving stone.
"We have the extremist groups in our grasp", police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as law enforcement helicopters circled the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or by private vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue raincoats, formed in Copenhagen this morning after the Friends of the Earth called for a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the environmental debt be paid back to the people of the South", said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition from the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say we have time", says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are waterways that you can walk through, which was never the case before".
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
José Bové, a French MEP and critic of globalization, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice". "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several figures, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, to address the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has been the catalyst for the demonstrations.
In Australia, organizers say some 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red bandanas, went out in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital to advertise solar energy.
Hundreds of protesters also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta to protest climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined the demonstrations organised by the "Network of 350", particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several persons gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the geography and history subjects are reinforced by the school reform of the lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", Luc Chatel, the national minister for education, stated that geography and history were to be reinforced by the school reform of the lycées, even though they were not compulsory in the terminale (year 12).
"Premiere students (grade 11) now have the same programme every four hours", Mr Chatel confirms.
The Minister said that "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile" but, on the whole, a concentration of "the best students".
"The socio-economic and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific", he continued, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have complained about the lack of historical-geographical education in the technical lycées".
On Saturday, an IFOP poll published in Humanité showed that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) criticize the government's project to eliminate compulsory history and geography lessons in Terminale S (12th grade with a scientific profile), which was also criticized by many teachers and intellectuals, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the S-terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher education, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which they believe is a victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they undergo a subject-specific aptitude test at the beginning of the year in Master 2 (M2) and an admission test at the end of the year, which tests their teaching skills.
They also conduct internships during the year at M2 and then teach in front of the pupils as internship teachers for a year.
He went on to say: "If you add up all the internships you have done before the test, you get even more hours than you spent in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours".
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - something "that does not exist in the education system".
He reiterated his intention to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the effort at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to tackle on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts address the public with fifteen-minute film contributions.
"We want to do something that will reach people and make them want to learn more", said Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the event, on the sidelines of the conference, which was named after the fish in the school's swimming pool.
"Around 20 participants were selected from the experts, also according to their charisma", he explains.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but you can also explain the core goals in a few minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking freely to about 50 people using only footage.
"This is part of our role as scientists", he stressed, hoping that the audience would learn from this that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier".
The videos of these conferences will be available online on the school's website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will be held every two months thereafter.
Late payment: angry prison guards, action planned
The unions of law enforcement officers have called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, which were postponed until January for budgetary reasons, are paid before the Christmas holidays.
The second union of prison officers (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on non-employees to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and block it to draw attention to the "theft of what is theirs".
The third, the CGT Penitentiary, called for "a strong mobilisation in the various prisons" which condemned the non-payment of overtime, overnight allowances and Sunday and holiday allowances in December as "disgraceful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officers, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations . . . to show discontent and anger".
The head of the Penal Service and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had increased sharply in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officers, guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and to modernize it", the Minister of Justice said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action to ensure that a situation such as this, which has arisen from a lack of assessment of the overtime available, does not recur in the future", added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff, who enjoy high service and target bonuses, explains UFAP/UNSA, for whom the "budget constraints" must be justified.
"This is an absolute scandal", the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces that it will boycott "all meetings and convocations" until further orders are given.
"Staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours from October to December are still unpaid, including overtime", the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"At a time when we are being given more and more tasks without more staff being hired, it is more than inappropriate to try to enrich ourselves with the staff's money", says the CGT union of Bordeaux.
The unions say that the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less affected than others.
But in any case, it is wrong, says UFAP Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he always gives out better presents at Christmas than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family for the first time at the White House, has told talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he always gives out better gifts than he receives.
In a Sunday evening ABC special, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave a glimpse of how they will spend the holidays in their new, stately home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be joining the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama reiterates, adding that the dog will of course also get a gift.
Michelle Obama vehemently denied her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts last year", she teases the president.
"So please", he said, conjuring her, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace, "and who gave you that?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV hostess who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about the gifts they loved most as children.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember my father visiting us one Christmas and bringing me a basketball", the president said.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized I had that ball from him".
The first lady remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse", Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday has had another operation, RTL confirms he's been put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France, and according to those around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent another operation at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday night after American doctors determined "damage from the disc-injury surgery" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his Paris production company, which added that the damage required another operation.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and said a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during his last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was not until 48 hours later that the patient's condition became more certain when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources" indicate that "no drainage was applied" after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a herniated disc.
The procedure, which was scheduled to last several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had treated many stars.
He was not available for comment to RTL on Thursday evening.
After the surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday with a post-operative infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley", but assured that "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was stupid to sit in a plane for 12 hours after an operation like that, that's not going to happen", said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responsively responds to antibiotics" and that "the infection has been contained".
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
However, concerns about the singer's health had been growing ever since he spent nine days in hospital in July after falling from his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement of the public, it was announced that Johnny Hallyday had undergone a "small bowel cancer operation" followed by a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
But since then, every health issue has been widely commented on, and fans and journalists have been aware that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to deny a re-admission to the hospital.
Euro 2009: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on his favourite 50m freestyle at Euro 2009 in Istanbul on the short track.
On the first day of the competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia in the men's 4 x 50 m.
It's a pity for Bousquet, who wanted to hold the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two King's distances in swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 seconds, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a first at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can always believe in bigger things, and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I'll try".
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in swimming this summer in Rome and world record holder.
The young swimmer failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but he still managed to win with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russians Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give it my all this time.
I knew I couldn't break the world record today, but I defended my title and did my job".
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future", Biedermann explained.
USA: Tombstone at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone found in the home of French writer Emile Zola was valued Thursday at $1.5 million, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 centimeters high, dates from the third century A.D. and has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, which "represents four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece, with only four or five of them in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It sold out in hundreds.
"The sale is still on, but this is certainly the most that buyers have bid for so far", Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was kept in the famous Borghese family collection in Rome for almost 300 years, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in the bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, minister in the Third French Republic and president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "legacy of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's attempt to escape from Honduras to Mexico has been foiled
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to home soil no longer acceptable, after the coup government rejected the transfer as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya overnight, there seems to be disagreement about how to carry out the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Department, the plane, which was chartered by the Mexican government and arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to transfer Mr. Zelaya, returned to its destination.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad under escort.
The deposed president, however, refused, wanting to return to Mexico as a welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has failed again by trying to make me give up at my own expense... they wanted me to resign", Mr Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, where he has been speaking frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has been raging in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, while some chords were played.
The Mexican embassy has sent us a request for escort, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, the interior minister of the coup government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur channel.
He had stressed that a possible departure from Honduras would be undertaken only as President of the Honduran people.
The rumors of Mr Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who had marched to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had stepped up its operations.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, he said, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had been close to the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day of the referendum he had organised to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21st, and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be jailed for high treason, which the coup government says is a criminal offence.
The coup leader Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted overwhelmingly against Mr Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street on the rise, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the US trade balance shows a recovery in the US and its partners' stocks: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has risen from 7.13 points to 2.190.06.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index was increased by 0.58 % (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from various sectors, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal on the premise that the market is focused only on 'half-full glasses', she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused on the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared with September to $32.9 billion.
The analysts had expected a deficit to increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the business research Economy.com.
In contrast, the number of unemployment claims in the United States has risen against all expectations in the past week, reaching 474,000.
However, the average number of new jobseekers has "fallen to the lowest point of the year" over the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market is down.
The yield on 10-year government bonds rose to 3,482% from 3,432% on Tuesday evening, and the yield on 30-year bonds rose to 4,492% from 4,408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle "Ladies in White"
Several hundred partisans in power in Cuba on Thursday beeped the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally that resulted in the temporary arrest of a dozen dissidents.
About 40 "ladies in white", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were beeped in the open by partisans of the Raul Castro government as they marched into the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the empowered partisans chanted with raised fists to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana the previous evening, in which no injuries or arrests were recorded.
In the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also attending Thursday's demonstration for International Human Rights Day were temporarily detained by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forcefully forced the dissidents, who were being groomed by government partisans, into civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Ladies in White organized an unauthorized march for the "Request for the Release of All Political Prisoners", which according to the dissident list numbers about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries".
The Cuban government, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating human rights and freedoms, especially freedom of expression.
Crazy man stabs 80 year old and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) late on Friday afternoon.
According to initial reports of the interrogation, the 28-year-old assailant had wounded the 80-year-old, for reasons not yet cleared, in or outside a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, with two knives, and this, according to police, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, died in hospital from his injuries, according to an official with the Alliance police syndicate.
In or near the same pharmacy, he made a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about thirty, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims were taken to hospital with serious injuries, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured man is in danger of death, as police sources say vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become unwell as a result of the events and has been hospitalized in a "state of shock", according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, fled to the same street, Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He injured two other passersby, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the latter of whom was seriously injured.
The scenario remained in the dark at night.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a local official of the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine region.
According to the witness reports obtained by AFP, several bystanders, including teenagers, tried to restrain the maniac.
I saw a guy in the Triple Crown with a green vest.
Three teenagers tried to enter.
They couldn't because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde came after him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were stabbed, police said.
The incident took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went outside and saw a 70-year-old lying on the ground, I put her in first aid and noticed a throbbing wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, came in, wounded by cuts.
State police officers finally arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has assigned the investigation to the Hauts-de-Seine Criminal Police Department (SDPJ 92).
The lunatic was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been questioned in court.
A police source doesn't rule out he's going to a mental institution.
According to another police source, it took six officers to restrain him at the Clichy police station, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of excess excitement" like "all such confused minds, in which the forces are released during the act".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to stop
The lawyer for the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called for the prosecution of his client, who is currently on trial in his home country of Switzerland for a moral offense committed more than 30 years ago, to be dropped in Los Angeles, California.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", has complained to three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal of gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977.
I demand immediate leniency, Mr Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time of the trial, Laurence Rittenband, "was a cold run down the back of my head".
According to him, the now deceased Judge Rittenband, before he delivered his verdict, had a discussion with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be sent to prison -- a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", by the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lie" to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court of Justice should refuse to stay the proceedings, Mr Hummel will request that a trial be held which would enable him to present the evidence in support of his arguments.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already made at first instance, namely that a discussion on the annulment of the facts charged against the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before the sentence was imposed for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor.
He hasn't been to the U.S. since.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?
In her view, "the filmmaker is asking the court for a favor and thus disrespecting its authority".
One of the three judges  who now have 90 days to announce their decision  even pointed out "that there are other escape alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the suspension of prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She reminded her client that she would no longer be bothered by any revival of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this trial was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26th, on the basis of an American warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street is being held back by the rise of the dollar and closes with no course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price, in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, based on the final figures available at closing, rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq dropped by 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is pretty quiet", said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tight, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year".
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving the market outlook for the strength of the economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab analysts.
In the USA, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, for the second consecutive month and far more than expected.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved markedly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Forecast.
However, the indexes were held back by a new rise in the dollar, which reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation", said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has gone down.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose by 3,540 % on Wednesday evening from 3,482 % and the yield on the 30-year bond to 4,497 % from 4,492 % the day before.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month-long tour of South Africa, the 112 contestants for the Miss World title will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world, in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which is being held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already won their tickets to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sporting or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a veritable whirlwind of pleasure.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Horn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and experienced many things! said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This is the ninth edition of the competition, which will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday at 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss is now focused on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will be present in this election as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted by music and dance.
The candidates will parade in traditional costumes and, not to forget, in swimsuits.
The show is presented by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, by former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and by a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with an unsurpassed warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have, like last year, taken a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bicycle and tasting the local cuisine.
But what was exceptional was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Not the usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
But her best memory is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town, South West, for the 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a bit more.
I'm with people I probably wouldn't have been able to get close to otherwise.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, Alice Taticchi, Miss Italy, has enthusiastically promised.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to visit his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane, which arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.
The son of the singer, who appeared relaxed, assured that he would go "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery on a November 26 disk failure.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma in Los Angeles tonight to relieve his severe pain and to allow him to undergo treatment", the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday, after suffering a bacterial infection following a November 26 disc surgery in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of the pathological changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event Friday morning at the French High School in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attends school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the orthopedic and trauma surgery department at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has put a heavy burden on the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he had committed the most brutal massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were utterly outraged, Mr. Camus explained.
I heard that there might be a lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles much too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I spoke to this doctor personally on the phone, and he assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which was a big surprise to me, since I had already had two disc surgeries myself, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practising at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor of dubious reputation, who has been convicted several times for failed operations and, not to mention, for tax evasion and fraud.
Mr Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the Chamber of Physicians, described him as "a man without scruples" who had to answer to the Board of Directors "regularly" and "anything but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He stated that the intervention had "proceeded perfectly" and that the post-operative examinations had been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been mounting since last summer, seems to be in doubt.
It is clear that the tour is a bit short for a continuation on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The Union for French Democracy (UDF) is getting energetic and is calling on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempt by the party chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to take over the seal of the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and urged him not to use it on any documents under threat of legal action.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF stamp, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political legacy after he had reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
Despite his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who claims ownership of the UDF mark, having first applied for that mark in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Property.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance, which was supervised by François Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they would not be dispossessed and, under threat of legal action, set a deadline for the Minister and the Member to stop using the seal and to transfer the ownership of the trade mark to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days suggesting that your political movement should adopt the UDF stamp, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, of the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement, the slogan of today's UDF+, printed on your political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office explained and calls on the NC party to "remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (its) website immediately".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required 'to transfer the proprietary rights of the mark to its legal proprietors'.
If you refuse, we will sue you to enforce the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that the UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the UMP party.
The party Nouveau Centre therefore has no rights to use the UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) stamp.
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the establishment of a bureau to defend 'the material and moral interests' of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the Office continues, 'at the time of his application for the trade mark, he had been no longer a member of the UDF for three years' but of the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is on the best way to turn into a crime and you ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us more dignified in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves than to try to escape from anonymity by fraudulently taking a name on which one has no legal claim".
The Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
The Nanterre court decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment in the eighties to snatch a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will face trial on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this case, worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are fighting while at the same time holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is being carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report by 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's gonna take these tests.
I will speak to her, explained Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As regards the lawyer for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Mr Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court of First Instance.
This is excellent news (...) The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he reiterated.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been suing François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to sneak up on gifts totalling a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
Although the court should review the admissibility of the lawsuit brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings on Friday led to a major family debacle.
The lawyer for Liliane Bettencourt, for example, referred to three letters sent by her client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she did not trust the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Mayer.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage".
The Nanterre prosecutor's office reiterates its view that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially since a custody judge in recent days rejected her application to initiate legal protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'is fully competent to act, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place", said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the public prosecutor's representative.
The Court has now decided to give judgment after the admissibility hearing of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
The manager revolution or the end of strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the company vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best, as it was formerly on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the enterprise, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place... despite the authoritarian temptation to impose separate products on the customer's preferences again on a regular basis!
A demobilization of the staff can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the enterprise, in particular those of R & D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI (Economic Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to take a proactive approach and to take a forward-looking view"; it demands from employees a commitment which is completely contrary to the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution that puts employees at the centre of the company's concerns, alongside customers.
The very limited benefits of internal surveys
Will internal surveys, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its employees, spark this revolution in management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First, because I could see that the whole structure, in the face of a new situation, after many detours, eventually comes to do first and foremost what it always did.
It is also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the magnitude of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a highly simplified view of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology, which originated in the great engineering schools, is mechanistic.
They are adopting, by intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that was recently reactivated by American "neuroscience" and unwittingly spread widely by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to apply the "lever" (sic) to employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces managers' attitude towards a mechanistic control system unsuited to today's world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilisation factors
Instead, the operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a basic protocol into every management thought or practice: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only the studies on multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
By identifying and measuring these mobilizing factors, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management back in place.
They thus create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: "Just War" brings praise to Obama from the right
The American right on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the night before and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who had mocked Obama's award on October 9th applauded the president's speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her subsequently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
She says we have to stop the terrorists down there.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday, a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives was delighted, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt that this speech was entirely historic, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio programme "The Takeaway".
The former lawmaker, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "leftist president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and cannot award a peace prize if there is no use of force".
Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush writer and now Washington Post editor, said Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does", he spoke "like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much to protect", Gerson said.
Among the few leftists who are not convinced, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, haughty and uninspiring".
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about Barack Obama's defense of the military.
If the war is covered up with justice, the massacre of the innocent can be easily justified, he warns.
The moderate left press, however, continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still considers Obama to be the early recipient of the Nobel Prize, called the speech itself "a monumental achievement" for a speaker as talented as he is.
The Oslo speech "provides a blueprint for guiding international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", says the California daily.
The New York Times believes Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "both bleak and exemplary".
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for a deal to secure supply at Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation to stay until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening, ending the strike order and the threat of severe supply shortages at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, 'welcomed' the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted early on Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly by late in the morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting angry.
However, it was still more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and it was not until 6 p.m. that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have caused a great deal of damage to the companies" and "it was feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wage groups (local and regional road transport) and a 2.9% increase for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rises from 8.72 to 9.06 euros.
"It's not much, but we're starting small", said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now being told to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some dissenters who are not satisfied with the agreement", he adds.
The TLF chairman, Philippe Grillot, described the agreement as "good", although it was "difficult to accommodate these wage increases in the face of international competition".
He said the increase was €170 per month for the low-wage groups and €100 to €120 per month for the high-wage groups.
'This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees,' said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) described it as 'a historic agreement'.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances and their residues is based on the principle of subsidiarity.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall road transport charge in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of employer taxes of EUR 100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the revised Finance Bill for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is demanding an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied initially to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to the whole profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order not to discourage the goose-eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complained Unostra.
The agreement threatens to "grave a grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months", according to the Otre Association.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
Disruptions on the RER A line, the largest expressway network in France for the greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike, between the unions and the management of RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), which continues to keep the strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases, was also held.
On this important Christmas shopping weekend, no trains ran between 10:00 and 20:00 on the main line (between La Défense and Nation) and only one of every four trains outside the main line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing the passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big shops with traffic".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran on schedule during peak hours, and almost none during low-traffic hours.
As on Thursday, there was no commotion on the platforms as the people of Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29, an engineer, said he would "get up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
SNCF, which had planned to provide passengers with assistance from staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no congestion at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived and departed from Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strike leaders held another meeting to review the results which the unions had deemed "poor" after their meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER manager proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of road accidents.
The CGT was outraged that RATP itself had put its wage increase proposals in brackets and stressed that the management was 'unable to solve a problem, whereas it was possible to do so with the long-distance drivers and SNCF'.
The RATP made clear that a new meeting on 'comprehensive review of working conditions' was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership which had so far refused to discuss the strike and suggested a meeting to calm the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions are demanding a wage increase of between 120 and 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and are complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which carries millions of passengers every day.
The RER drivers, who have many years of experience, receive a gross salary of EUR 2 200 to EUR 2 700 and a salary supplement of EUR 600 to 650 for shift work and Sundays and public holidays.
Turkey's Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to end the 25-year conflict, extremely difficult.
The "Democratic Society Party" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, requiring a majority of seven votes to enforce the dissolution.He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political activities for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed their opinion before the verdict that the MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as non-party MPs.
The decision follows a 2007 case brought by the Turkish Federal Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no links" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling by the Constitutional Court has put the government in the middle, which is seeking to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to eradicate Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders reiterate that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks have led to clashes with the police.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement officers used tear gas grenades and water cannons as protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Türk expected the court's decision to "further deepen the despair".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, ed.) issue by banning a party", he told the press.
The government, which is composed of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems", said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo on the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government", said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"It is obvious that we can prepare for a reaction from the PKK", he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack that three days earlier had killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes for.
It is not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
It is so that his employees can try out and master all the vehicle technology.
Weather forecasters say it could be the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are on standby to deal with snow and ice.
The FES has a very precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are taken off by large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads and transit routes such as the Neue Weg and the Hanau Landstraße.
But also fire stations, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sloping routes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three in the morning
The approximately 1,040 kilometres would need to be covered with wet salt, which is more sticky, in a maximum of three hours if necessary.
That's why the FES starts at 3:00 a.m., "so that the routes are clear until business traffic starts".
It's gonna be hard when it doesn't snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scatter trucks".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are the roads for supply and development, including the Council-Beil road, on the move.
The last priority is side and bypass roads.
There will be complaints, Braumburg knows.
At 5 a.m., the FES's foot people will be on their way, with priority on evacuating danger points and crossings.
The FES cannot take care of all the cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Because of the rapidly smooth terrain, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the sprayer is on the move.
If necessary, the police will call for him.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long, five-foot-tall animal walked on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws, and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be anything special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to display these physical features, report Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relationships, distribution, and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We've sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for Triassic deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about early dinosaur history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
Sterling Nesbitt says that this is an extraordinary discovery: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only found in fragments".
Other dinosaur experts don't necessarily share that enthusiasm.
This discovery is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current theory, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these dinosaurs is often controversial.
For example, experts debate when lizards split into their three main lineages: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long-necks", and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithischia, which included the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced features, says Nesbitt.
For example, on the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found evidence of air sacs, like those of the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups probably had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers conclude that lizards first appeared there.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America to all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangea.
The team, along with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two other theropods not closely related to each other.
The researchers argue that the three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which is a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn-based paleontologist Martin Sander.
His view may be distorted, for South America is simply home to a remarkable number of primitive dinosaur fossils, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare side line of the reptilian lineage to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, including the ancestors of modern-day crocodiles and flying sauries, and numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world, developing many new species, while the relatives on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic became extinct.
Success stories did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction event, which the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals that had also evolved in the Triassic to flourish, and since then a shadow being has been born: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California are all on it.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
The police's evacuation of the occupied Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement in German and English, they 'disapprove' of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
The university president, Werner Müller-Estler, had ordered the evacuation of the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories believe, did not justify "the violent dismantling of self-organised training courses by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an 'unacceptable interference' with the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and distract from the content.
The Bureau has refrained from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers are demanding an immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is said that the majority of the occupants did not support the damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Trade Union Confederation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi-Land Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Minister for Science, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, defended the action of the President of the Union and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the Union.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a press conference on Thursday in the Wiesbaden parliament.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, says Peter Beuth, a CDU member of parliament.
The opposition parties, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, saw it differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they cleared the place.
The Left has submitted a petition asking the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
The new Silicon Valley
For years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, was a heavily guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the commune of 216,000 inhabitants, located 23 miles [37 km] from the center of Moscow, is known as "Russia's Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science centre Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Union's external relations policy.
Moscow's deputy mayor Yuri Rosljak and Selenograd's prefect Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation, while Frankfurt's planning director Edwin Schwarz signed off.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the scientific research area will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ firms will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Citronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
The following is the list of the Member States:
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
The proponents of the project simply call it "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the City of Baden-Württemberg's state capital into a decade of hopeless site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
At the time, the mainline stations with tracks running through the city were considered 19th-century fossils of transportation, acting as brake pads for modern railway traffic, since it once took enormous time to re-twin locomotives from back to front.
Drive in, stop, keep going - that's the way it's supposed to be.
And that's why the mainline stations should go: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, about halfway along the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is being tackled now, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian big cities, it is almost impossible to implement the deep-laying.
However, the problem of entering and leaving the mainline stations has been eliminated, since modern turns with traction and steering cars have been introduced at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 next to the new ICE route to Ulm is now being approached.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, partly because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayers and not by the state-owned group.
The project is still justified to a certain extent in terms of urban planning.
New urban spaces are being created, which - if you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - are being given plenty of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are designed for passenger traffic, which was attributed to a huge growth - typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost airlines.
Modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
However, the new route is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep inclines.
More importantly, S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
The Commission is proposing to allocate a total of six billion euros to the Swabian language.
That's the official number.
Experts say 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade, money will be lacking at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 kilometres of the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a rapid pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube properly here.
But S21 will act as a brake shield.
The Rhine is becoming a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport ruling
The Land Government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally review the more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had on that day given written reasons for the need to re-establish the night-time ban in the event of the planned construction of the North-West runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population from nighttime flight noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4th whether to appeal the ruling.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the government representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The Socialist Group's leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban, otherwise this would be seen as a "breach of promise".
It's damn hard when you can keep your word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP's campaign slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government trying to "distort the law and trickery" to get to their night flights.
A thorough legal review will take time.
The Coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the European Union.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-shaken US big banks are stripping off their state shackles.
Bank of America on Wednesday paid back the aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
And according to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to reinstate state aid.
The aim is to remove the restrictions that have been imposed on the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had secured $19 billion in new money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the money she took from her own cash register, which was well filled by, among other things, department sales.
Bank President Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: "The money injection helped us through a very difficult time".
The bank had risen to prominence at the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations to the State.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion capital increase, CNBC reported, citing sources.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quickly
It all happened sooner than I thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors ousted the incumbent editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, the station can present a successor.
Last night the board was going to vote on the staff.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadt studio in Berlin.
However, the broadcaster did not confirm this - officially, in order not to interfere with the proceedings.
However, it is also likely that the Commission's proposal did not further damage ZDF Director Markus Schächter should the Board of Directors reject it.
Frey, Schachter's nominee, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the time of the closure of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter's proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years failed in the board of directors.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's election was a crushing defeat for Schächter, but one to be expected.
The European Union's majority in the Board of Directors had already indicated weeks before the election that it would not confirm Brender.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was organised by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He rejected another term of office for the highly regarded editor-in-chief, arguing that the ZDF's news programmes had lost ratings under Brender.
The ZDF's political influence was therefore criticised in protests until shortly before the election.
In the last few days, 35 state legislators had intervened in the debate, judging Koch's action to be unconstitutional.
It didn't help.
By person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that he worked for the South West Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey joined the ZDF, first at the "heute-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal adviser to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and presenter of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by the trade newspaper Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's counterpart on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should amend the ZDF State contract so that staff proposals by the Superintendent cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a list of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had made a clever move to recommend himself to the board - by sharply criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
This evidence of journalistic independence enabled Schächter to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the board of directors to elect him without suspecting him of elevating a party member to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already considered a left-wing liberal.
Study is being disrupted
After a year of education strikes, the ministers of culture of the countries finally took action on Thursday: at a meeting of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed to improve the conditions for studying at bachelor's and master's level.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the burden of examinations: in principle, each study module should be completed with only one examination.
The aim is to check the workload of students and to ensure 'a realistic and reasonable level'.
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural requirements for bachelor's and master's programmes more flexible.
There should be no national rules which differ from this.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of education and university rectors have been carrying the word of better accessibility in their mouths.
Now it has been filled with concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in some cases: "Each module usually ends with only one examination", says a 30-page paper intended to partially re-regulate the admission of study programmes.
The aim of the "significant reduction in the burden of examination", explained Accreditation Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm, was to "stop a development of errors which had significantly impaired the studyability".
In addition, "studability" is to be "the decisive criterion" in future design.
The Commission also stressed that the 'serious need to check whether students are unnecessarily restricted in their choice of content' was a key factor in the development of the new 'modules'.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the
Students would be "entitled to be given spaces which enable and encourage self-initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses and to the review of existing ones.
These must be 're-accredited' every five years  which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all programmes to be reviewed.
The national accreditation bodies are ten, and they are subordinate to the national accreditation councils.
The Ministers of Culture had urged the countries in October to "strenuously" influence the agencies so that the material supply is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and colleges of applied sciences have already agreed with the Länder ministries on the appropriate measures.
The only country to have so far committed additional funds to the Bologna process was Rhineland-Palatinate.
The money is intended to be used primarily by universities to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study counselling and examination and study abroad offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
The government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act in Parliament at the beginning of 2010.
The aim is to provide a single test for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the study programme more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other higher education institutions and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's degree programmes will be reviewed for their eligibility.
The government and opposition had once again argued on Thursday over the conditions of study in the country.
But there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso-Hochschulen-Gruppen called for education policy to be shaped no longer "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should also be involved in the "talking-to-talk" process.
The future academics were supported by the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom the HRK was consulting on a joint reform paper.
The Union for Education and Science (GEW) has taken the Bonn Decisions too far: it calls for a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor's degree to access a further master's degree.
The second is that countries must ensure that tomorrow's generation of bachelor students will have sufficient places for master studies with the best possible study conditions, says Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Executive Board.
Countries must hire significantly more lecturers.
The Ministers of Culture did not, however, express any wish to have more free access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
"Entering Germany and leaving is pretty much no control"... is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he discusses in disturbing language fragments the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable attention last Tuesday at a conference in Munich on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security files".
Visibly unsure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he confessed to fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his work as an IM for the Romanian intelligence service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment efforts would have started in a sluggish manner, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "one who has not resisted enough to intimidation attempts by the Securitate".
The lyricist Werner Söllner is in the Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors of Romanian origin is shaken by a case that reveals the depths and the lowliness of a political system based on surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only the perpetrator but also the victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter had played a role, said literary scholar Michael Markel after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He "took him out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
He said he had a moral need to make that remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but not surprising is the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate spies, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own 914-page file.
The people involved, it is to be expected, are speculative and in some cases probably knew which name was behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the now very procedural surveillance of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
The Commission has also been involved in the preparation of the draft budget for the period 1994 to 1996.
A National Council for the Preparation of Securities Files (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthler Authority was only established in 1999, but the issuance of the files has been rather slow since then.
It is only since 2005 that there is a law regulating the management of the files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, as was shown by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate head from Temesvar spoke negatively about the laureate.
She's psychotic, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power was thought to be expressed here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
The Söllner case, as so often in connection with covert guilt, certainly raises unavoidable questions.
The audience's thoughtful reaction to Solner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The European Union has a long history of
It seemed as if a well-dressed salesman was coming from a very nice Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer had been handing out Goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the equipment store, climbed into a crowded C-Class at fifteen minutes past midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness let himself be driven by the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not involved, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old was not.
It's been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow we'll get back to work.
Or get it right.
In the words of the Swiss, who had only been signed three days earlier: "We have reached the last eight", in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: It will be a brutal fight against relegation".
The "much more important task" is coming on Sunday.
Then it's time to replicate the first-class performance in the league.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the three fast goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) to put down.
Drawing
The Champions League semi-finals (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February/matches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the flaming stand of the Babbel successor remained subdued.
Not only the supposed savior who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professional confidence, commitment and playfulness in a short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths and urged them to be more courageous, explained psychotherapist Gross the so-sounding recipe for success, which had failed to work under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury, was quickly promoted to the top of the field thanks to his dynamic, tried to describe the "phenomenon" he observed with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new manager works: "He is a man who is penetrating and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation".
Under Babbel, it had obviously been lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the hill, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a weak and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They would have won Glasgow, too, before the evil awakening came four days later at 0:4 in Leverkusen, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt was not in the mood to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview broadcast just before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coach under pressure from pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered the cancellation of his day off after the games a sign of lack of sovereignty and disapproval.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", Heldt retorted and announced consequences for the finisher.
I don't think they're gonna be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
But they were agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work of the team of trainers replaced, the playful and fighting performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big part in the success", Heldt and Lehmann said in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World heavyweight championship
Hot duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the WBC association, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously in the night to Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
It was Klitschko's third title defense since his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone was expecting didn't work out.
Klitschko has 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to pretend to be beaten due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02 meter tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left leading hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly avoided the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and was just trying to get around.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some stir before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was then provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "so I could see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also won his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and I'm in very good shape physically, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA's belt, however, is held by the British David Haye, who in November was able to dethrone the 2.13-meter-tall Nikolai Valuyev.
Haye had earlier cancelled a September fight with Vitali Klitschko.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for giving false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has assumed that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is deliberately deceiving.
The minister said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tank trains in September, Green party leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news programme "Tagesschau".
It's called, "He lied".
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only aimed at destroying the hijacked trucks, but also targeted two Taliban leaders.
The US airstrike, requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation report.
The Greens, SPD and the Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery has not influenced the actual operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry's statement on the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have provided accurate and complete information about the circumstances of the tanker accident.
Officially, they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials' surroundings revealed that they had even referred the DOD to several reports, including a two-page document by the commanding officer, Colonel Klein, and a field fighter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the matter in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received a reply so far, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the investigation committee of the Bundestag, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
The dream world
Some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill and the drug addicted who blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are free to indulge in the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
However, in the modern Western world, those who experience dreamlike states while awake, seeing and hearing things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered to be insane or drug addicts, at least a freak.
But such images and voices are not just produced by the mentally ill or by drug addicts.
It's our imagination that's to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dream, delusion, and reality.
Dreamy altered states of consciousness can take many forms, at best we call them visions, at worst, delusions.
Although the causes and effects may differ, visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic raptures, psychosis, and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the brain's neuronal messengers - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusions and dreams has intrigued philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle defined hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of madness with dream states", and Sigmund Freud even described dreams as "a psychosis, with all its dissonances, delusions, and delusions".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and creaky.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, winged devils with blood-red, twisted scabs, teeth-splitting.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices are ringing from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, knots them into a noose and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a loudspeaker and puts the noose around his neck.
It jumps.
The noose is coming off.
"Go to the hospital and get cured!"
Henning T. is 40 years old today, he's had six acute psychosis episodes, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was caused by LSD.
He's been diagnosed with schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, taking medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, and he's been married for three years.
In the psychosis, he says, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population develops schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime, and it is the second most common disorder treated in psychiatric hospitals after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the sufferer is often unable to distinguish between the internal and the external world, and becomes over-excited, which can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, delusions of relationship or delusions of pursuit.
Especially common is the practice of hearing voices - voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain is unable to filter out disturbing signals, and the mind is flooded with impressions.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the floodgates to ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
Reality perception in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic at the University Hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he becomes passive, he is overwhelmed by events, as in a dream, and he cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are often unable to reconcile reality, the illusions are cruel reality, no waking up.
Having a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike in dreams, says Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis is basically preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real frame.
Why our brains make capriolets is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional circumstances can cause anyone to lose his sense of reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Researchers believe that the brain damage is minimal.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But how the disruption of the neural system occurs remains a mystery, and it does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the mood is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often a matter of opinion.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book The Unreal World in Our Mind.
Hallucinations are a typical symptom of psychosis, but they are also a symptom of a surprising number of other disorders.
These often include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, as well as diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and traumatic brain injury.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, like boxes, are made up of memory contents that are usually withheld.
They occur when areas of the brain that process sensory perception are overactive or under-inhibited, when our brains are running hot or when we lack stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal from stimulation, stress, love or other mental states.
In recent studies, up to a third of those interviewed reported experiencing a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break, a slender boy with long, dark hair may approach it.
When he answers, the classmates look at him in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a wild daydreamer, but Sarah K. isn't dreaming, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
It's a good feeling she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? She sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions aren't real and they're gone.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the illusion is also a burden.
When she is in the classroom, she may not be able to follow the material because the teacher is presenting a new student to her eyes and ears while explaining mathematical equations audibly and visually to everyone else at the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes far too seldom and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the scratches or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, are coming before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the figures.
She won't tell her parents or friends, they'll think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows for sure she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from deprivation of arousal, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is under-occupied and is self-entertaining.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old, when she learned that the man she's called "daddy" since she can remember is not her biological father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real impressions and sounds, people like Sarah K. have difficulty distinguishing between illusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, where reality is formed.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Even nightly dreams are viewed by the box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Therefore, Dr. Kaster advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world, which is too conscious, imaginary experiences are unfortunately often pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative aspects - insanity is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has been exploring what's called the oneiroid form of experience, a particular form of dream-altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers real and that he cannot distinguish from waking reality even afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness is created in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example in polyradiculosis patients who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
If a person is threatened with loss of self and world, such as permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening reality with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's kind of like the border between a dream and a hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a change in the world takes place, but the reality is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning-making and meaning-giving in an inherently intolerable situation, which allows us human beings our own creative capacity not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Changes" as a salvation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen is immersed in a self-created world, visiting strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, on board a train sanatorium, with a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst nobles who make intoxicants out of blood.
He's being dragged by a Greek on a motorcycle back to his homeland, surfing in the snow of the Alps with his hospital bed, and he meets a Korean mobster.
He's completely absorbed in the imagined events, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen than any other dream.
Dreaming is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are still vivid in me, years later, in subtle details.
More vivid and intense than even what you actually experience.
The intensity of this experience pushes the horizon of our other life experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of the outer reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
It is an experience that can be rewarding.
The snow may come
The Burda
Children to take over the publishing business at 27
The new editor-in-chief, Kallen, is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will remain 100% family-owned.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long run.
Both children inherit at 27 and have the firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We've arranged the details for you.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question is whether they are capable of doing so.
You can't put your kids in front of 7,500 employees if they're not skilled enough.
It kills the kids and the company too.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would retire as CEO in January and appoint Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Management of Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury division was responsible for the company's assets and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also for direct marketing, foreign affairs, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is running the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
The designation of calluses also served to bridge "ten, fifteen years", Burda said.
The holding company should remain 100% family-owned, Burda said.
In the case of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from bankruptcy: "It was always about families who were infected by a capital addiction, who were completely speculative and thought that they could become a big player.
That was never my strategy.
He "never had any dreams of world power", Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time', these stores have grown too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you desire in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, having recently opened a store with an area of over 1000 m2 in the Callao shopping centre in Madrid, where everything is about personal hygiene.
The wellness area on the eighth floor is home to other well-known companies, such as Hedonai, which provides laser hair removal; Spaxión, which offers spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments; and the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, and L'Occitane, which offers natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department, which is noted for its teahouse, with over 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while enjoying a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to have your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many opportunities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the clients' training sessions and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that's across from the devices.
After that, you'll see different videos showing you how to do your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures us that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are all it takes to train the muscles of the body.
And if you want to visit the hairdresser after you've trained your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where you can find personalized treatments to restore your hair to its glory, shine and health.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the heart of the city, which is always open from 10am to 10pm, 365 days a year.
The most varied decolletés
Christmas is fast approaching, so it's another great opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their holiday dresses into our closet.
The shape of the necklace, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
The project is designed to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and will make arrangements on mobility through management, coordination, subsidisation, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarise the opinions and actions of the sectors concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transportation of the future.
3 'electric cities'
Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework contract is to promote research and technological development activities in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
These activities include those related to energy and in particular to its performance.
It is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standards groups and has a number of additional projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts "a horizon of calm" for the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter.
In his presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the Government during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants", the Prime Minister said.
'With this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue producing in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a clear horizon for the future of this industry, which is our biggest export sector,' he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Automotive Industry Integrated Plan (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn have led to investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Mr Zapatero also underlined the measures taken by the Government to stimulate demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are being implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan will reduce emissions by an average of 6% for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Automobile Fair, an exhibition for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world, is held in Madrid.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition will be held on an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, where 200 national and foreign exhibitors will showcase their brands.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the articles you can think of related to the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors at the fair can therefore be found with accessories, spare parts, components, material accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc.
Hundreds of items from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and enthusiasts alike.
The companies which will be participating in this fair include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of automobiles, specialising in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the field of outdoor activities
In addition, the sales activities at this trade fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports car exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed racetrack in the open air area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sporting and environmentally friendly
Mazda wants to prove that being sporty is compatible with protecting the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop-and-start system of the engine, named i-Stop, for the Mazda3 model, a device which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation Mazda 3 stands out in the overall picture for its good grades.
The finishing touches, the construction of the vehicle, the comfort, the road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
The steering wheel is also excellent.
Further examination of the instrument panel and dashboard unit shows that Mazda's large number of buttons and switches in the striking red and blue colors are in line with the Japanese trend towards futuristic interior design.
This style is reminiscent of the Honda Civic.
It can therefore be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever before, allowing four adults to drive comfortably.
To all this comes a spacious and well-shaped trunk.
The stop-and-start system is currently only available for the two-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a six-speed transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, its quiet noise, its performance and its low fuel consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this petrol-powered i-stop because of its great convenience in gearing and low fuel consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the best-selling.
As regards the equipment, the so-called Sporty model selected for the test run is a special one, as it has a much larger number of elements from the production equipment.
The production equipment is made up of the vehicle's trajectory controller (RVM) which eliminates the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the large-screen on-board computer, the parking sensors, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chrome-plated 17-inch wheels.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough, the Premium package, which includes, among other items, the learning Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-Loader.
The Commission
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0-litre petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which ranges from 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the tested Sporty model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the ultimate in driving pleasure every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. is rolling out the red carpet of sensuality for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shone more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that allows you to read your emails without the possibility of seeing certain attachments or browsing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
It's unlikely to be seen on the street, but the idea itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company launched two new devices: one that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, in contrast to Peek, which costs six times as much.
Fonpeek, which was presented at Le Web yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limitations as its American counterpart, but with a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance fee for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read your emails once you cross the border or when you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a way to connect to Fon).
The idea of flat-rate roaming is incredibly tempting and should have been possible a long time ago.
It is true that some telephone companies already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable Europe-wide roaming tariffs has been almost ignored.
Outside your own country, you're always afraid of reading your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (which is always amazing, it has the name Fon, even though it has no Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer these kinds of tariffs means that the telephone operators have to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example, and its prices include the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
No hooks or hooks.
It is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, at the time of purchase, not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime internet access like Peek already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The color of Michelle's fetish
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American first lady.
When Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of that color, and she chose the same color again to accompany him at what was, without a doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the Nobel Peace Prize award in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides being almost the same color - a shiny greenish-purple - the dress consisted of three parts - a dress, a jacket and a coat made of the same fabric - and she wore something coarse embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the material from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress of lace and in Oslo a dress of patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-heels and the second time a modest model, but gold.
Her hair was different every time, with her hair up in a crown on this occasion and her hair open on the previous.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 makes this clear: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted by motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and, if so, what kind of occupation they have.
Those who do no other work outside the home, work only part-time or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with permanent jobs, especially in the public sector, are delaying the start of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a permanent job do not have their first child until 3.7 years after moving in on average, a figure that rises to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who took longer to achieve this and who did not move in and have their first child until much later.
Moreover, the nature of work has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of readiness to conceive", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor to be taken into account when it comes to the age of women at marriage and the birth of their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also observed among women of the same age.
For example, women in the 35-49 age group, whether they have only a primary or higher education, became mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 or 32.1 years.
There is also a further difference between women according to their level of education.
While women with a bachelor's degree get married before their first job and have their first child, women with a secondary or higher education do the opposite, seeking a job and getting married and having their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its much-envied list of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The star of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous icon, like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
The men's cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting partner in "Lost").
The British Fashion Awards
The British have a big say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both past and present - met at the annual awards ceremony held at the Royal Court of Justice in London.
They had all appeared for the occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
In "Poker des Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent presents the three X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
Instead of using a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), he seeks a likeness to the ardent heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting, and Vicent is not spared the horrors or the enlightenment.
Besides being a delightful read, this book is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "In reading its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt without having found words for it: joy in contrast to a disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between helplessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humour, without any sense, like the dagger blade that almost killed him".
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was seduced by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were combined with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to get to heaven by the detour of perdition".
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, and it's one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, you have to climb the north wall, the wall where the best climbers try again and again".
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny guy.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a landlord in the county and then other times he said that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain gravity.
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the mad cry that was shouted from a bridge by that Munich personality, so that its echo would echo deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way, during a journey in which he fled from himself and pleaded with posterity with a speech full of violence from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed, 'My dear God, I beg you to do all in your power to stop me writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these lines by Spencer: 'Sleep after effort, / after the storm of the harbor, / peace after war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death".
About Virginia Wolf: "She always carried her depression in her luggage.
Her husband took it quite normally when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is not a single other case known where the man had such patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness".
On Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do but try to get Joyce to join Baroja?
What was Benet's intention if he didn't introduce Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but destroy that man's reputation so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old walked by her and our dog, a hybrid we brought from the shelter that weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two times and hurt him badly.
We cannot express our indignation because we cannot understand it, since the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was executed on a leash.
In addition to the suffocation attack suffered by a woman who was walking around in comfort when she tried to reprimand these people for the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he might do the same to a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman, or perhaps even to anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been howling all day.
Of course, we have reported the crime to a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether it will be of any use at all, and in order to avoid any prejudice from the outset, we would just like to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what has happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship, amusing.
We do not know where the good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative is designed to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, which is the only protective device that can prevent head injuries or even death in a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes far beyond the design and manufacture of products that are becoming safer every day", and reiterated that it is also contributing to this goal with other actions of an educational and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, which is called 'To be or not to be', will initially distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops to ensure the best possible dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is 'a constant concern' of the company, and precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, it always feels obliged to do so, one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of light-duty trucks are up again
After almost two years, the small van market is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to figures presented by the Anfac manufacturers' association and the Ganvam car dealers' association.
However, these good figures should be assessed with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison is from November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the previous month, the total number of registrations in these 11 months is still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles were sold since January, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the small haulier market: the descendants of passenger cars, pickup trucks, small hauliers, small vans and lighter small trucks/chassis.
The same storm clouds are still in the sky, which are the ones that are affecting demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of cases buy with third-party financing.
The Commission has also been asked to consider the possibility of extending the scope of the Community's financial assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In this scenario, and unlike passenger cars, financial support has not helped much in the purchase of a Plan 2000E vehicle.
This scheme is not only for private individuals, but also for self-employed people and small businesses who wish to buy a small van of up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions limit of 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam had reminded that it is imperative that the State should pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Car Dealers predicts a similar year for 2010 to the one just passed, with a sales drop (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now compulsory
As with the anti-lock braking system ABS and as is happening now with the stability control system ESP, the emergency braking assistance systems must become a compulsory feature in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, and a period of grace has been fixed for the remaining vehicles until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's action aims to improve pedestrian protection, but the way these braking systems work can also help to prevent many road accidents.
The purpose of the emergency braking assist is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects by the braking force applied by the driver to the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure to the end.
According to a study commissioned by the Bosch vehicle component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake pedal before the collision and half had not brake at full power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Brake assist, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system, thus reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance a car travels during braking.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents involving injuries to persons could be prevented, it is estimated - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while applying a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant applies maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on April 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American carmaker points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to get the party concerned to give their consent to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the plants are located, may be delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM assures that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising, then, that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing support.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
Using the Boxster S as the basis for their latest and most expensive jewel, the engineers actually managed to make it 80 pounds lighter, bringing it down to just 1,275 pounds.
To achieve this, they first abandoned the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a cellar-window roof with manual drive, thus saving 21 kg; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, 15 kg are "disappearing"; by removing the air conditioning system 13 kg are removed; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kg; by installing sporty Bacquet seats 12 kg and saving another five kg with the lightweight 19-inch rims.
Then, by discarding the CDR-30 audio system, the weight was reduced by six kilos again and by replacing the door handles with cloth handles.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller California country roads, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
He's a good driver, you can only give him a perfect grade.
But the reduction in his weight has by no means meant that he is no longer so safe on the road.
It is quite the opposite: it has been a long time since we have tested such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a great sense of safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He's a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low speed for the time required, until we give him the commands to race, to brake, to recover, and then to get everything out of his engine again...
It does everything you tell it to do, and the car does everything you tell it to do with your hands on the wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his 320 hp V6 Boxer (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether it's from standing out or re-accelerating.
The suspension is strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads we drove in the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car made good use of the puncture holes.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route, although we found ice at dawn and rolling in the afternoon on some of these corners.
In summary, it is an ultralight car, a car with an indescribable driving pleasure, which is probably rare and contains much more than just a slight improvement on the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag girl
The singer, a crush on Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiffness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia Awarded Itself a Victory in Israel
Despite the many outstanding players in Dusko Ivanovic's squad, Caja Laboral celebrated an outstanding 82-91 victory on its visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra football pitch, taking first place in its group after the grand performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the Blue Reds leading, who had been sitting at the top of the signboard from the start.
Since the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were already coming out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come onto the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the Álava team opted for a home game by Barac and for the game by Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on his return to the team that is his home, to further extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though Splitter's "minus six" rating already suggested that this would not be the Brazilian's best night.
However, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was still far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elias" they got back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in turning the tide for the "yellow" (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with hit safety to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triplets and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the scoreboard was again shown a calming distance of (54-67), which the hosts could embellish with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavens were blown out in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and despite Splitter being dismissed for fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being given the front
Unicaja lost heavily in Greece to Olympiacos and had to cede the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and this in a game that was characterized by the absences from the players of Unicaja (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the home game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their performance in the first quarter, the Andalusians were able to start dreaming: an aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja event, even though the local team managed to score 22-20 in their favour in the 13th minute with an in-house match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, the minute in which an action almost led to a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority in both halves of the game, while the exit of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted errors of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
With their midfielders and Lithuanian striker Linas Kleizas, with his triplets, they increased their lead to 44-32 in the 19th minute.
Catching up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to make up the difference of the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which again put the lead within the group in doubt.
Unicaja tried to put aside the many failures and the dismissal of the Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and the triplets of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope returned to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, once they attacked and showed their superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be stopped.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket differential to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out what their salary is, based on their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads for real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can use a Facebook form to enter their occupation, work experience, age and the city where they work.
Just one week after the application was first made available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels badly paid", explains Trovit product manager Albert Ribera in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data available to Trovit through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer earns a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of EUR 34,247 in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil gives Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who is removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the embassy before that date, where he had sought asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, as his term of office expires on that day and he must find a new place to live".
The station also quoted the former president as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government", Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to seek asylum in Brazil this week.
This failed, however, because of Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician that the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measures taken to stabilise the markets were to settle the debts by buying assets directly and to allow liquidity to flow indirectly at zero interest rates, so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that they have virtually ended their direct asset purchases and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policies, are starting to pour some sand into the gear, as the ECB has already done with its annual auction next week.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the European Parliament's amendments, which are in line with the Commission's proposals.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond differentials are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The Member States were forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt is rising again.
The emphasis is now again on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refugees of investors, which in turn increases the differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain has so far been hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a new downward revision of Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does no harm in silencing the moral risk advocates who once again tried to make those responsible for world economic policy aware of what they had done, by slowing down the devastating effects of the credit limitation on job losses, when they should have decided on a new day of Thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government that hides the national debt, elections and a new government that pulls the same string.
Prodi made it to Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin should rescue Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member state to default on its obligations.
It is logical, however, that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, on the verge of an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to excessive amounts, which would now be within the range expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the government debt differential is increasing at the same rate as European corporate bonds.
However, if European differences were to decrease and Spanish differences were to increase further, this would be a specific Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce.While the local forecast indicators are forcing a large number of market research institutes to favour their recovery scenarios and to upwardly adjust their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise longevity despite warnings.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "be careful when driving" is the order of the day.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the subcommittee of Parliament, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply over the next two decades is being debated.
After his speech, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some highlights of what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and EUR 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that investment should no longer be in increasing energy production capacity but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and we should increase performance.
The Commission's proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, subject, of course, to other 'supporting' energy sources.
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy that has just been passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, would not say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
He said that "this is a clear long-term trend, despite some 'individual' measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola described them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial acquires Aer Lingus' handling of 10 airports
The Swissport subsidiary of Ferrovial for groundhandling services at airports is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage services at 10 European airports where it is represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have been released so far, is for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation to create an innovation centre for smart infrastructures.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million euros by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study the energy efficiency of motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The tunnel is a project that will cost A$1.7 billion (about $1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are his competitors.
A 5 km tunnel in the eastern coastal city of Brisbane, Australia, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself as a construction company and motorway operator in the country.
The city wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the decision to use public-private partnership (PPP) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
Pending the tenders presented in May, the estimated investment is A$1.7 billion (€1.047 billion), with three consortia, mainly European, competing in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy and is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Acciona team is opposed by the Northern Direct consortium, which consists of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure company Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the short list, is called LBRJV, formed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public works.
The Australian infrastructure market offers huge construction and privatisation opportunities, but there is a barrier to be overcome, as access is only possible by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton.
Million in assets
Acciona is investing in this geographical area of major importance to the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage the 700 million-dollar desalination plant in Adelaide.
It now intends to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground tollway, which is being funded by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and will be called Northern Link, is designed to connect the western motorway at Toowong with the bypass at Kelvin Grove via a 5 km tunnel.
The roadmap issued by the City Council provides for the award of the contract in summer 2010 and the start of construction in December of the following year.
Although the tollway is scheduled to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government is providing A$500 million (EUR 308 million) in funding.
For the deep sea, Brisbane is a big deal.
Australia is continuing to award large orders to Hochtief, which signed a $154 million contract with the government yesterday.
ACS will improve the fibre optic infrastructure of the domestic broadband network through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide 400,000 people with fast Internet access and will keep the German company employed for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project for the 27-storey King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet started and for which Hochtief has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it is competing with Laing O'Rourke to build and run two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC wins contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has obtained EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1 km tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the contract for the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way Alpine is reinforcing its experience in tunnel construction.
The construction work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore receives a promotional ticket from Renfe.
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services to Mrs Rushmore for the next two years, totalling some EUR 3 million a year, the railway company said.
The contract also provides for two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies which presented for the competition organised by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
The Commission has decided to impose a fine of 63 million on France Télécom for the suppression of competition.
The French competition authority has fined France Télécom EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone operator has restricted competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty schemes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was even increased because the competition authority is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Trade in the application
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has launched an application-based trading site on the Internet to increase revenue from non-telephone sales.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
It is necessary to wait until 2010 before these Siete are available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League match has brought in 476.4 million for Madrid and Barça since the start.
Since its creation in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth highest-earning football clubs in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it is also a major source of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of which are Spanish) that have participated in the event since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is the third-highest-earning club in Europe, and the only one to have won the trophy three times, next to AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former Euro 1992 Cup finished fifth.
The list is headed by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams which also made the most money from their participation in the previous Champs-Élysées.
And that's despite losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third among the countries that have been able to earn money from the Championships, although it has more titles than any other (five, compared to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution of the
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure used by UEFA.
The organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects to generate revenues of 1.090 million from the Champions League this year.
Of this amount, UEFA has allocated 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a place in the competition received 3.8 million euros for their presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team).The clubs that reached the quarter-finals each receive three million; the four that reached the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner gets $9 million, as opposed to the runner-up, who gets $5.2 million.
A football club, for example, receives at least €7.1 million and at most €31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with its victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, this is not to be taken into account in the variable payments, which amount to 337.8 million.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places allotted.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the prize money, 30% for second, 20% for third and 10% for fourth.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for a 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details yesterday of its offer to buy shares, with a ceiling of between 25 and 29,9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which, on account of the number of shares, does not oblige it to make an open tender (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which will be paid out over 10 years at an interest rate of 1% per annum due to this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa is valuing the company at 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jeréz Group gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in selling their shares.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not received any comments from the interested parties on the application of the measures.
The final payment would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos is continuing to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of the way of possible offers and the legal disputes between his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal auditing.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post, directly responsible to the Chairman of the Group.
This is far from controversial because the company is embroiled in a legal battle over the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million sos to other Salazar family companies.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
As regards the Salazar loan, yesterday the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing its purpose.
CNMV approves the tender for the exclusion of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions complied with the applicable laws and that the content of the submitted declaration form could therefore be considered 'sufficient' following the amendments of 2 December last.
CNMV also indicated that this offer aims at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, which is 8,95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares registered on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed, which could not be transferred in any way until the tender was closed, and the price of which had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New programmes for the inspection of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car repair shops are earning
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are hauled to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage and the cost of repairs.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000 per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
But with the help of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That's why almost 100% of the appraisers use this type of system.
Accident assessment and repair service and application providers shall collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it and provide it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all assessments are made with its products.
The other two companies competing in the market for tools for evaluation and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex's sales manager, the company works with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of whom provides the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as a new car is launched, the companies start working.
It is a difficult task, since each of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catalogued and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an 'intelligent' graphic image on which different parts of the vehicle can be 'clicked'.
If the model is a big seller, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If the car is a less used one, it can take up to three or four months.
For example, they have information on the more exclusive models, such as Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
The number of vehicles on the roads is over 99%.
For the purposes of documentation and database production, Audatex has eight centres around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialised in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) working simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
They're recording 2.5 million data each month, and their customers get the updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus to offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repair, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that gives information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this service in Spain, but in the United States.
A review of the products offered by Audatex provides an easy overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard accident assessment solution for the appraisers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid for according to its purpose, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive is for customers who use it rarely, up to 10 times a month, which is 5.75 euros per month.
But every insurance company that makes thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow a vehicle and the equipment with which it was run off the assembly line to be fully identified by reference to the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used to offer services for vehicles declared to be in total damage.
Their statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, for carrying out geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on variations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to determine how many models of a particular car have had to be repaired due to breakdowns or how many of them have been involved in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It also distributes GM Estimates, which is also intended for experts and likewise provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% per annum over the last three years, reaching EUR 10,8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, they started to enter the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America.
The total worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and today its shares are trading at $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auctioning of cars in bad condition
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought an Internet platform for the sale of motor vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value added, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealerships, who are required to register before they can carry on their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
The daily number of ads is 3,000 and the Spanish market is adding 100 new ads every day.
Under Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose registration number has been revoked may no longer be used on the road, but certain parts which are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, finding the spare part, and creating and preparing a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are motor vehicles, 109 are off-road vehicles, 137 are motorcycles, 78 are small vans and 44 are trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the model concerned appears and the spare part required is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the hours worked, surcharges or discounts, and then print out the estimate of the costs and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller is not, however, a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount which the customer can easily pay.
Audatex is currently working on the possibility of offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for a long time in the automotive industry, because it allows you to choose a door, for example, and then turn the image completely around to look inside.
