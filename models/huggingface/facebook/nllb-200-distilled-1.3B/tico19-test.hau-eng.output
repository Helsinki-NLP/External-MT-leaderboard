Increased risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) reflects a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that confirms that, while at a different level depending on the country, the COVID-19 outbreak is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on evidence from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increase in COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare, and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a new outbreak of an unknown pathogenic pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported a novel coronavirus agent that was classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease that causes SARS-CoV-2 infection has been dubbed the women's coronavirus (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to severe illness requiring hospital stays while a decreasing 6% develops to severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed variations in the incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/EEA country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with those in Italy during the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to various countries and the rapid spread of COVID-19 in the rest of the world is currently tracking this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first European confirmed case of COVID-19 based on WHO case outcomes.
Within the EU/EEA, France reported three cases for the first time on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, where between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Access to the cumulative and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infections
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 statistics for every country in the world, which are obtained from only official sources such as national health ministries, national health agencies and WHO and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared them to those in Italy.
As a representative of the trends in COVID-19 cases, we have calculated 14 days of cumulative decreased incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the trend of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, between 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented a summary of the number of reported cases in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy on 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trend in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day fluctuation in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection in EU/EEA countries and the UK was generally tracked by Hubei Province (China) (Chart 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then peaked around 28 February 2020 (additional factors).
This was driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increasing COVID-19 cases (Overload).
Figure 2 shows the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the EU/EEA and UK compared to that in Italy as of 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported cases compared to Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our findings suggest that the number of COVID-19 infections is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observations in the COVID-19 phenomenon suggest that the epidemic has been growing at a rapid pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, in national public health responses, and possibly different jurisdictions within countries with different criteria for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19, including having a test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported a situation where ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas were already reaching their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 and/or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data are not reflective).
They should, however, be compiled in a systematic manner to match current surveillance data focused on case reports and mortality rates.
Studies from 2010 to 11 showed a significant difference in the availability of intensive care and hospice beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have fewer resources or less than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intensive care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
A ranking model based on the fullness of healthcare facilities, statistics for each EU/EEA and UK country and the prevalence of hospitalization for COVID-19 infection cases that met &gt;> 90% and the risk of over-crowding of care beds, was developed in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since the infection rates are shared across some EU/EEA and UK countries, hospitals and intensive care units often serve a defined local population, information on the incidence and beds of care would be best obtained at the Nomenclature of National Units for Nursing (NUTS-2) level.
Learning from Italy and current experiences in other countries suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the community transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare, and special care, such as that occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the latest ECDC risk assessment, rapid, comprehensive and systematic action is essential to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a progressive to a mitigating approach, as rapid increases in the number of infections cannot provide full-time advisers and even hospitals to understand, adopt and adapt the process ahead of time.
The early warning assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the outbreak.
There is a short window of opportunity in which countries have the opportunity to scale up their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health pressures.
Having said that, it is likely that the healthcare systems of some EU/EEA countries will face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, becoming a humanitarian disaster.
Similar to the same virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence and mortality than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more elderly people than younger people and men than women.
In response to the increasing number of rapid publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a more comprehensive study on the development of the topic of rapid research.
We will learn the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help in understanding and eliminating the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 was an unforgettable experience for all Chinese who were asked to stay home throughout this holiday and for several weeks after the outbreak.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was given the name CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other locations worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""public enemy number 1"" and potentially more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment have been published since the first report on January 7, 2020 which listed the disease isolated from a number of patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of the research in a new and rapidly developing topic area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV that causes the disease, the Arabian respiratory syndrome (MERS outbreak, in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and treatment of disease and some remaining questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-toxic viruses to humans, most of which cause about 15% of influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered two human-to-human outbreaks, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries with devastating outbreaks and deaths.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure. 1,1, the first case of non-spike pneumonia originating from Wuhan was reported on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Administration of China.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was followed again.
On 15 January, 2020 the first case was first reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the disease spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, a report was issued by health officials, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under lockdown and public transportation suspended.
On 24 January, an initial clinical investigation into the outbreak reported that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the first site of infection from animal origin.
On 30 January, WHO declared a global pandemic emergency.
As of the time of this report, the virus had already spread in China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).2)
As the situation progresses rapidly, the final outcome and extent of the spread will be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a clinical study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a new outcome of the outbreak as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS affects people of all ages, but is most common in people aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, a few were under 20, and only 14 cases were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males (0.31 / 100,000) than females (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in a roll in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took 5 days (2-9) from onset to diagnosis.
The average duration of the disease's development is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from birth to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13)
The baseline birth rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 correlation was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased significantly before 23 January 2020, which coincided with the official start of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases of influenza was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a member of a large envelope family of viruses that contain a single RNA strand.
Three families, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, can be classified, in which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
Ambulaf increases binding to (S) glycoprotein at the receptor sites of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after genetic modification, the genomic RNA backed by a glycofurotin envelope and nucleocapsid proteins form virion-containing vesicles, which then bind to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new strain of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 samples collected from the outbreak's source, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the oxygenated parts of the human epithelium.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is more closely related to human ACE2 than to SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes fewer infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can produce a short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral transmission and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known active region or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al, reported a cryo-EM formula of a complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å resolution in the amino acid transporter complex B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which was found to be open and closed, was assembled as a chemical dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind to two S-protein-binding proteins, providing evidence for CoV diagnosis and infection.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug trials to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the center of the disease.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and are transmitted to humans by cats and camels.
By comparing the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other CoVs, it was determined that bats were the habitat of SARS-CoV-2 as the novel virus was 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate agents help the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the mode of transmission is still unknown.
Ji, et al., have proposed snakes as the carrier of the virus from bats to humans that is linked to interactions between S proteins.
Based on a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-nosed, mouth-toothed, venomous animals commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the likely SARS-COV-2 vectors based on a 99% genetic link in a CoV identified in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However the 1% difference spread over the two genes is still a significant difference; therefore, the final results are awaited for definitive proof (Fig.(Fig.33).
The specificity of the SARS-CoV-2's biological properties is still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a test vial for up to 48 hours in a dry environment for up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to maintain a temperature and humidity of 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing chemicals, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat reducing agents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively destroy the virus.
The general population has lost immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no full studies have been reported on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).4).
Generally, after the virus has invaded a host, it is first identified by immune response by receptors (PRRs) including C-type receptors, toll-like receptor (TLR), node-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-like receptor (RLR).
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory agents, dendritic cell adhesion, and the development of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit viral transmission and increase viral replication rates.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to escape the immune response.
Soon, the vaccine response became a war against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the infected cells.
The T helper cell produces inflammatory cytokines to aid the cells in their defense.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Immune systems including connections like C3a and C5a and immune cells are important to fight infection.
For example, the isolation of immune cells from a recovering patient displaced MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an over-seeding of the immune system causes a large amount of free radiation in the host that can cause damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst case, multiple immune failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by infection by association, is more likely to affect elderly residents with certain diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who have a high risk of infection or who are isolated from work to be more likely to get it than others.
The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, with a maximum of 3-7 days based on the initial study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 people with the disease showed that the average birth date was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent additional study showed that the preparation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2 days) based on the history of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time of quarantine according to the time of confinement, thus preventing infection but people who do not have the virus to others.
As a general rule, people in public, or infected, are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the period of isolation be extended to 24 days?
Fever is the main and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be associated with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, nerve pain, hypertension, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients were more likely to develop severe respiratory disease, nerve damage, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without symptoms of pneumonia, should be screened for the virus to detect it quickly.
A demographic survey at the end of December 2019 showed that the prevalence of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar reports were reported in two recent studies of familial cough and cough caused by transmission from a person with symptoms of the disease.
In comparison, a 2012 human study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them require respiratory support, more than COVID-19 patients and are more likely to have a higher MERS infection rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever rate (99% -100%), dry bone cough (29% -75%), dyspnea rate (40% -42%), diarrhea rate (20-25%), and sore throat rate (13 -25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% -20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, deaths for SARS from November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 people who had been confirmed infected.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 census, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was above 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was listed as only 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, morbidity, and R0 are presented in Table Table1.1.
The above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less susceptible than the latter two.
Thus, it faces a much greater challenge in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A journey was often made in the same family or from a single meeting or vehicle, such as a boat.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected or terminally ill people within the last two weeks before the outbreak.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and then recovering patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends a signal to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have equal or decreased white blood cell counts (especially lymphocyte counts) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts <4 × 109/L associated with lymphocyte counts <1×109/L, and asotate aminotransferase and viremia levels were elevated in 1,099 patients infected with COVID-19.
Levels of hepato-vascular enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and there was an increase in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte counts in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a degraded fibrin product present in the blood, is elevated, and the number of lymphocytes is reduced.
Chest radiographs are typically found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by two shadows or a low-glass lining in the lungs.
Patients are usually at risk of developing pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid retention, and progressive fibrosis severely impair the gas exchange.
The imbalance of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases tension, thus reducing lung dilation and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Thus, the most severe cardiac diagnosis often coincides with the most severe.
On February 18, 2020, preliminary COVID-19 testing showed a decrease in the number of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, and uterine cell walls, and a large number of viral cells in the lungs of infected patients who died from the disease, matching the pattern of ARDS-like infection in SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase (RT-PCR) has been used as a key test method for COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of no-deaths, which can accelerate the spread of the disease, clinical signs for diagnosis (not relying on RT-PCR) were first used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the SARS outbreak.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical appearance, laboratory tests and radiographic analysis is important and necessary for making a valid diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang team reported a method of using CRISPR's SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthetic molecules at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without the need for exposure of the instrument.
Hopefully, the new technique can improve mental health and well-being if proven in clinical trials.
Due to limited experience with novel CoVs, physicians may provide specialized care to COVID-19 patients, while several therapies that have been used or proposed to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other infections (Table 2) are being tested.
These treatments are current and possible treatments with antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients who have recovered, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for medical use.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs in the first stage and possibly also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and respiratory failure are the major risk factors for patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes all respiratory therapy, ventilation, ventilation from a ventilator, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory syndrome must be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced pacemaker technique used to treat serious heart disease or respiratory failure.
In addition, the regulation of electrolyte balance, prevention and management of infection and immune system disorders, and protection from organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine surges occur as a result of an overestimation of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine shock is a type of inflammatory response systemic response induced by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines along with the host cell release a large amount of unchanged drugs that are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is important to monitor cytokine surges, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine shock.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for cytokine shock include the modulation and direct response of T cell antibodies; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; JAK inhibitors; blinatumomab; cytokine marker 4 inhibitor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not beneficial for severe pneumonia in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which is a side effect of the disease.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses are recommended for use with caution for COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective vaccine had been proven.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, is effective in US COVID-19 patients.
Remdesivir is a new antibiotic that Gideon initially developed to treat infections caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, the secretariat also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
In response to these, Gideon provided a link to China to conduct two trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are expected to be positive.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as therapeutic agents for patients with severe respiratory disease.
Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other painful reactions may occur after combination therapy with lofinavir/ritonavir.
The interactions of these drugs with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered from immunosuppression.
Blood transfusions from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other infected patients or to protect public health from infection have a long history.
Of course, recovered patients usually have a high level of immunity against the virus in their blood.
Antibodies are antibodies immunoglobulin (Ig) produced from B lymphocytes to fight bacteria and other foreign substances and are sensitive to specific antibodies in their host.
In this regard, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and mild symptoms and improved oxygenation in the bloodstream.
However, confirmation and explanation are necessary to introduce a method for maximum benefit before specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effect, other plasma-related side effects should be considered carefully.
For example, immune systems can overreact to the immune system and cause the release of alcytokine signaling, which can be life-threatening.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is high to treat patients with chronic illnesses.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and desirable to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify cell codes associated with improved immune systems or screen specifically for important antibody proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat many other diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness depends on the combination of several components in a formula that varies depending on the disease study considered in the TCM theory.
Many of the active ingredients are unknown or poorly understood because it is difficult to isolate and verify such compounds or their components.
Currently, due to the ineffectiveness and specificity of COVID-19 treatment, TCM has become one of the most common therapeutic approaches for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those recovering from severe stages.
For example, the combination of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen has been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest curing rates of COVID-19 patients in several Chinese provinces using TCM were 87% of their patients, including Gansu rate (63.7%), Ningxia rate (50%), and Hunan rate (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 cases, had the lowest curing rate (13%).
However, this is a poor estimate as other influential factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) therapy alone with a combination of WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the times required for physical recovery, symptomatic deterioration, and hospitalization were lower in the WM+ TCM group than the group in the WM-only group.
Most interestingly, the injury-increasing disease (from mild to severe) was less common in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await further well-controlled trials on a larger scale and in more institutions.
It would also be interesting to know the nature of the procedures and explain the effective TCM treatment tools or their combination if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 often face a greater risk of infection and even death, and people who are isolated also experience depression, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, respiratory distress, and cough as well as various side effects of the treatment such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids can cause increased anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there was a range of psychiatric disorders including chronic anxiety, depression, panic attacks, anxiety disorders, depressive symptoms, violence, and even suicide.
Increased contact and quarantine of patients, as part of the public health response to the spread of COVID-19, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the spread, isolation, and rejection of family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, people in close contact with them and other members of the public who are in need.
Mental health support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health communities, clear communication with regular updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Antibiotics are essential to disrupt transmission routes from animal bodies and human infection to pathogens easily and often contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance to treatment of anemia caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-coupled vaccines to produce long-lasting and immune-disrupting antibodies and/or immunosuppressive agents against SARS-CoV infection.
Live vaccines were evaluated in SARS animal samples.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in older people with rare disease models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have not yet been determined prior to the start of clinical trials.
Perhaps because SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, devastating cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic processes in the affected areas.
A vaccine strategy for MERS was developed using weak viruses, DNA plasmids, viral strains, nanoparticles, antibody-like particles and small molecules evaluated in other animal samples.
Developing effective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised populations is urgent and essential to combat the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long time (at least 18 months) required to develop vaccines and the mutation diversity of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 began to fully emerge as a clinical illness through thousands of new infections.
In most cases, patients may recover gradually without any sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality among patients with severe cases of the disease.
Therefore, creating a predictive system for the disease is essential for health authorities to prioritize their services, especially in areas where resources are difficult to provide.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the progression of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age is the most important predictor of SARS, which is true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred most frequently in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of these patients over 50 in the 8,866 case studies as described above.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have other co-morbidities and complications and are older than those who do not (in the median age of 66 and 51), suggesting age as a risk factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males than females (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Disorder and difficulty: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart failure and arrhythmia.
The incidence of heart attack is also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may bind to ACL2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and disease are closely related and can interfere with each other.
Non-invasive laboratory testing: C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood indicates severe inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed to be a potential predictor of disease loss, sensory response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The relationship of CRP levels to the severity and likelihood of COVID-19 outbreaks has also been discussed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue degradation.
So they are the masters of heart failure or liver failure.
Major clinical signs: Cardiac imaging and the sudden progression of clinical signs and symptoms should be considered along with other indications to predict outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroid medications: As described above, steroids are an immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunct to antibiotics to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in SARS patients, many of the survivors suffered from osteonecrosis with life-threatening disabilities and reduced survival.
Therefore, if necessary, low intake and short-term steroid use should be recommended in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffer from severe depression as they endure prolonged periods of isolation and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of loved ones and close friends.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, the COVID-19 symptom has a different epidemiological profile from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also divide significantly in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no early signs of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or during the preparation stage may produce large amounts of bacteria during normal activities, causing great difficulty in treating the infection.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV is considered to occur when patients become ill, while most transmission does not occur at the initial stage.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Intensive efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuation of a general quarantine in the hope of ending the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Despite these actions having devastated the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new cases is declining, reflecting a decline in the outbreak.
The best expectation is that the outbreak will end in March and the monsoon season will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are pessimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which is likely more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team from Canada reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the central turbinate and throat of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the new virus may be something similar to the influenza virus.
However, there are signs that China has seen a decline in new cases, suggesting that the current strategy is working.
The Ebola outbreak has already been predicted to cause one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, by isolating and isolating, the disease eventually ceased.
Possibly, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weak in infection and eventually die or become less virulent in humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with those of SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been detected in bone, creating a new possibility of bone-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of these infections were due to nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other back conditions and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, high levels of protection should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those who come into contact with the sick or infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and the N95 type of respirator (series #1860s) help to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent the possibility of infected people from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces, where they can be transmitted to others.
However, N95 (series #1860s) masks can protect against inhaling virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 m long.
Since particles can enter even five surgical masks that are individually wrapped, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series #1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation clothing to further reduce contact with germs.
Germs can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his eyelids.
Therefore, healthcare workers also wear face masks or goggles when working with patients.
For the general public in affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap to prevent the spread of the disease more frequently, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Six feet was considered the proper distance for people to sit to avoid sickness.
These activities are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a relatively new virus to the human world, its high risk for SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused great concern for China in light of its serious concerns about the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reassured citizens that the new variant of the virus has a low human-to-human transmission and low fertility rate and is not a problem for the prevention and control of the disease.
The message eased public outcry, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and it took a long time to bring the virus to its lowest point in Wuhan.
Epidemiological authorities in China may take this lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public statements as each word affects citizens and can change attitudes and decisions; (2) more responsive and focused on unknown information from hospitals rather than waiting for detailed information from doctors or officials; (3) more proactive in addressing pandemics in its early stages rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often to provide accurate information and effective strategies for increasing public awareness of pandemics and testing and improving community response systems in some cases.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the implication of a resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some striking differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for the control of the disease and the care of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and men more than women, and the mortality rate and mortality rate are higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS had a mortality rate higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms while SARS patients do so typically when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to carry COVID-19 transmission than SARS.
This partly explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA that is specific to SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who are cured may be positive for recurrence.
These studies have increased the risk of spreading the virus.
Given such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, key issues can be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs have been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal species is the intermediate transmitter of the virus from the original transmitter, that is, the bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to # 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off transmission, and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although genetic modeling and genetic confirmation suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the cell cycle and cause mutations?
Does the virus also carry ACE2 expression in other organs?
Without the answers to these questions, we cannot find a reliable diagnosis or a reliable treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus change the climate when it spreads between people?
Could it be a global pandemic, a deadly one like SARS or an occasional recurrence like the flu?
It is important but may take time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, with whatever money he required, we had no choice but to stop the epidemic early and get back to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have led to the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their habitats, including humans, over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, human transgenic CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the tables on how the HCoV outbreak might be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 pushed the incidence of CoVs forward and surprised us that it was easily transmitted but the virus incidence was low compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is transmitted from animals and understanding the origins of HcoVs helps to tell.
Most HCoVs genes originated in bats where they were relatively harmless.
Transposons of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the animals that are infected can directly help to protect people from the disease.
Testing for CoV-infected animal interactions may help to identify the spread of CoV-infected genes in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their identification history and how they evolved zoonotic origin and spread across species.
The key here is to distinguish between HCoVs from understanding how viral origin is replicated and how genes are replicated from their original source.
The 2019 COVID-19 pandemic is described here.
In addition, the extent to which the virus needs to successfully adapt to a host that is mutating and the extent to which the virus' evolution exacerbates the disease are emphasized.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a specific group of single-stranded RNA viruses.
These pathogens consist of a large number of RNA-like genes from 26 to 32, which is why they are called CoVs and can be seen under a microscope.
By design, CoVs have an unclassified gene that is similarly organized.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two major open-label proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab copy polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are coded nsp1~16.
Other parts of the genome contain ORFs for protein such as spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many of the genetic variants, are also coated with different CoVs genes.
Based on the differences in their genetic sequence, CoVs are classified into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV comprises the majority of HCoVs and is further divided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Biological evidence suggests that bats and animals serve as the source of origin for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main pool of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years now, CoVs have overcome genetic barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human-transmitted infectious CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified in humans.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Arabian respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Infections with HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as flu and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 subtype are the most common infections causing severe neurological damage in patients with a high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, knowledge about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 has been gaining ground through extensive epidemiological studies.
Of course, the idea that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless was accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the worst outbreaks in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a severe mortality rate of about 10%.
A decade later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak became a common epidemic in the Arab world and spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the representative of the evolutionary pattern of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has caused more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have a genetic origin from animals such as bats, mice or domestic animals.
A growing body of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are highly adaptable and not pathogens but show high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic presents a major medical, scientific, social and ethical challenge for China and the world.
The study of animal origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the genetic history, driving forces and barriers to the transition of species.
This may lead to or facilitate the detection of the pool, intermediate and growing host (s) of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications in the protection of future recidivism.
In this workshop, we presented a brief overview of the origins of zoonotic diseases, their transmission between species and the structure of HCoVs.
In particular, we shed more light and clarify the genetic origin of HCoVs rather than the fact that they evolved from non-pathogenic genes after entering the body of another person.
We also reviewed the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs in which an increase in transmission often accompanies a decrease in the virus carrier.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is described here.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from the nasal discharge of a person infected with the common cold, CoVs were isolated in various infected animals such as rats, mice, cattle, pigs, rabbits and dogs.
In the last two decades, the four HCoVs family genes were discovered.
A summary of the history of HCoV detection in the first table of this table (Table 1) will be satisfactory and provide more detailed information on it.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from respiratory tract infection of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, later gaining widespread acceptance in the WI-38 pneumonic cell lineage.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with chronic cold symptoms, including headache, nausea, vomiting, nausea, fever and sore throat, and fever and cough were seen in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from an organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of mice.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are characteristically differentiated from infection with other viral diseases such as influenza, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally transmitted, and are most commonly transmitted in the spring, in unwarmer or colder climates.
The incubation period for both types of infection is usually less than a week, followed by about two weeks of allergic reactions.
Based on human volunteer studies, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E have developed a common cold.
Few patients whose immune system is sub-optimal show severe infection with the disease.
"SARS, also known as ""pneumonia virus"", was the first documented HCoV-causing virus in human history and the etiological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV identified".
The first SARS infection can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spread across several countries and continents.
Except for the main hosts, it is estimated that each strain can cause approximately two of the two strains, with a preparation period of 4 to 7 days for the viral stem to appear on day 10 of illness.
Patients who are infected with SARS-CoV are initially accompanied by myalgia, headache, fever, malaria and severe colds, followed by dyspnea, cough and severe depression as symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver function tests, and creatine kinase induction are common elements of SARS testing.
Diffuse alveolar damage (lung damage), epithelial cell proliferation (spread of cells on the body), and increased macrophages (white blood cells) have been found in SARS patients.
At least 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and ventilation.
Beyond the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the stomach, liver and kidneys can become infected in these severe cases of infection, usually with cytokine resistance, which can be especially fatal for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a collection of pneumonia cells from a relative of an Ebola patient who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been made to study the HCoV virus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It is primarily found in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illness.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and diarrhea are common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
An independent study identified the isolation of one disease from a nasal sample from an 8-month-old baby with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first discovered in the Netherlands, it has probably spread throughout the world.
The HCoV-NL63 gene is thought to be responsible for at least 4.7% of respiratory infections, and is most common at the beginning of spring, autumn and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the bacterial infection of the bacterial cell wall, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was first identified in a 71-year-old man who was rushed to hospital with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary artery disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing a small number of targeted infections.
All four HCoVs and communities have established a habitat in humans and are generally not mutant enough to cause significant pathogens, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the most common case of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe respiratory illness in China.
In general, when these HCoVs are able to disperse effectively and retain themselves fully in humans, they also become less destructive or harmful.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute respiratory syndrome and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Given that most of the confirmed strains originated from the Middle East, secondary outbreaks have been reported to be in close contact in various European countries and Tunisia.
A secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 people confirmed with the disease.
The clinical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, several MERS patients also developed renal failure, which is a major factor in differentiating the MERS cuatr from the HCoV-derived pathogen.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed infections were present with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest human diseases ever discovered.
In mid-December 2019, a number of patients with respiratory illness or pneumonia that was then thought to be similar to SARS-CoV-2 were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has announced the development of an outbreak under the policy pathway that caused SARS-CoV-2 to pose a major challenge to international public health and designated the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In particular, the death rate in Hubei, China was 4.2 percent, while the outbreak was 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also common in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the symptoms and can progress rapidly to severe respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in terms of their nucleotide sequence of 82%, they cleave into different branches in the genome tree.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is very low, indicating a high level of tolerance for humans.
A newly reported SARS-CoV-2 infection marker may contribute to the rapid global spread.
Comparison and substitution of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal significant similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the mode of transmission of HCoVs are similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
The second is that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms depends on the interaction between SARS-CoV and four other strains: HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are most commonly seen in infection with HCoVs, which are experienced by the community, including the presence of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a lower severity of COVID-19 infection can be seen as seen in SARS-CoV infection, however the incidence is low.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows signs of an interesting pattern of HCoVs and community presence over SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 variant was similar to that of the HCoVs found in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined whether the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection decreases after localization data in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, in common with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
The study of whether or not oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV will be confirmed in future studies.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can manifest itself as a community-acquired HCoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 features including transmissibility, pathogenicity and progression of post-transmission sites in humans will be influential in the eventual determination of the COVID-19 outbreak.
All four populations found HCoVs that cause associated symptoms to be homologous to humans.
In other words, it may be true that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
Alternatively, both may be from the life-cycle of the HCoV virus.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and people who have been infected with serious HCoV infections have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient degree to allow for an accumulation of mutations that would overcome the restrictive factors of the host.
In this way, the longer the outbreak duration of SARS-CoV-2 continues and the more people infected with it, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it has a high prevalence, human-to-human transmission would be much more difficult through containment or other measures to prevent the spread of disease.
For decades, four communities have found CoVs circulating in the population, causing flu outbreaks in the shellfish industry.
These bacteria do not necessarily live in the body of a human or animal.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens are poorly adapted to humans and their transmission to humans cannot be further controlled.
They need to survive in the bodies of their hosts in order to be able to enter humans through one or more humans rather than from animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.
This is a very contagious disease that can spread like HCOVs in a community, at least in our time.
However, it is more virulent than the population of HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be able to adapt fully to humans and move around inside humans without a central storage or shelter in the bodies of animals.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be helpful to discuss the evolutionary, biological, pool, intermediate and evolving characteristics of HCoVs.
An animal that becomes an evolutionary host for HCoVs if it preserves a close ancestor gene that is highly similar by a linkage at the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus is usually live and does not pose a threat to the environment in which it lives.
Similarly, the HCoV port pool maker is continuous and long-lived.
In all cases, the group carriers are naturally infectious and are the original HCoV group or pathogen.
In contrast, if a new HCoV introduces a new medium prior to or near its introduction to humans, it is not adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This, once the virus has established itself as a host, can become the source of infection and play a key role in allowing the virus to multiply where it can then infect humans.
HCoVs can test for terminal disease if they cannot continue to spread in the host medium.
Unless otherwise noted, HCoVs can survive in a different organism and can cause serious side effects that take time to manifest.
Here again, the person whose disease was last in the body will be the same as where the disease originated in the first place.
Animal epidemiological data revealed a routine review that the SARS case study had a history of interaction with toy animals.
The following seroprevalence studies suggest that pet traders have experienced an increase in SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The civet (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the pet trade were the first to be identified as carrying viruses that are similar to those that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is directly supported by the fact that no further SARS reports have been received after the killing of all other Sivets animals in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild civets from wild or farmland without exposure to live animal markets have not been infected with SARS-CoV, suggesting that sealed civets may only be a potential intermediate transmitter for SARS-CoV but not a safe haven.
In particular, since 80% of the various animals in markets in Guangzhou have SARS-CoV immunity the possibility that many species of small mammals may also be the medium-expansion hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these are at the point where the SARS-CoV virus dies in their bodies.
Subsequent research for the animal host SARS-CoV identified a nearby bat CoV called SARS-Jemagen Rhinolophus CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-JemageCoV HKU3), which is found in the bodies of Chinese horses.
These bats contain SARS-CoV antigen and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 class antigen.
This and other bat CoVs are 88-92% related by nucleotide sequence to SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the groundwork for a new theory that bats host human diseases.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none if any of the WIV1 isoforms can be classified as a live virus.
The human enzyme-catalyzed conversion factor 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 gene derived from bat bone has been used in bats and cats and ACE2 in humans as the receptor.
Interestingly, the SARS infection that they were getting was able to disrupt WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the original progenitor of SARS-CoV in bats, being similar in 95% to the nucleotide sequence homology.
However, there is a broad pattern of association between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis of the MERS-CoV strain to a single group of Jemage CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 bacteria.
Both bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent and RNA-specific sequences of MERS-CoV are similar to those of European and African bats.
To date, there are no signs of MERS-CoV living on the body of bats.
MERS-CoV and its bat-like variant CoV-HKU25 are 87% related in their genetic make-up.
So bats are probably not the primary carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East showed that single-breed camels had a viral resistance to MERS-CoV antibodies, similar to camels native to the Middle East found in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal cavity of a single mosquito, further suggesting that camels act as a safe haven for MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that most mild but still viral outbreaks have been observed in experimental camels during MERS-CoV infection.
In particular, infected camels excrete the bacteria not only through respiration but also through fecal-oral contact, which is also the main source of infection from bats.
However, questions remain as many MERS infected individuals have confirmed that they had no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown means involving undetected animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a bacterial CoV RaTG13 isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to place parental relationships.
The implication is that bats may not be direct hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless a nearly identical case of CoVs is found in the future.
Most likely, the host medium of SARS-CoV-2 should be a wildlife species sold and killed in the seafood market, which many early COVID-19 concerns are associated with, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission of the disease.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a number of small mammals at risk of extinction, known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may be carriers of beta-CoVs ancestors related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new genome sequences of pangolin CoVs combine 85-92% of the genomes of the nucleotide homology sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are related to RaTG13 and approximately 90 percent of the nucleotide base.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like subtypes in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% evidence of amino acid sequence origin.
However, the mutation rates of the RBDs of SARS-CoVs-2 and RaTG13 are about a million times different from their host.
A previous study on infected pangolins also reported detection of viral symptoms from lung samples, which were similar to those associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a variety of combinatorial methods to produce a genome sequence that comprised approximately 86.3% of the total bacterial genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are among the animals that carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 pangolins due to sequential differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 hybrid pangolins and beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 ganglia associated with beta-CoVs.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to bats and pangolins and other animals has become a self-evident phenomenon.
Whereas the largest sequence of genes is found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RaTG13 capture the largest sequence of genes.
It is widely speculated that the high similarity in position between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoV-beta and SARS-CoV-2 subtypes is due to evolutionary reversal.
A consultation is appropriate for reconciliation between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-linked RaTG13 in tertiary wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is highly prevalent among beta-CoVs.
The decision makers are still on the zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 origin.
Excluding the HcoVs virus complex, data from animal samples were also studied for HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
Biological evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while parental variants of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) that was detected in three-toed bats in North America has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is closely related to another CoV strain, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, while the camel is suspected of being its co-transmitter.
To provide an overview, current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic studies have provided evidence for the occurrence of transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 was isolated from domestic animals in 1890, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The history of the HCoV-229E virus is not very clear.
The virus was identified from bat CoVs that are very similar to HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpha-alpaca-CoV.
There is considerable evidence that the disease is transmitted directly from bats to humans.
Initially, humans but not bats could interact with bats in sharing environmental science.
Instead, humans are drawn to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated al-CoVs were highly variable and unregulated in bats, while Alpha-CoV caused a viral outbreak in infected animals.
Finally, no alpaca alpha-CoVs were found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility that HCoV-229E originated from human CoV genes cannot be excluded.
Indeed, bats are the direct source of human viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alpha-CoVs serve as a pathway for HCoV-229E, alpacas and sea otters may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at its initial discovery and was reinforced by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats are the most potent carriers of diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.
Longevity, vast colonies, social proximity and the ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats to be a good 'virus carrier'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is appropriate for these camels that have turned from a comfortable medium into a guarded and moral stable.
MERS-CoV causes mild disease and retains a low mutation in these animals.
Transmission to humans is so sudden that humans are the only place where MERS-CoV can no longer spread due to its uncontrollable spread.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially the pangolin bat beta-CoVs that live primarily in pangolins.
They may be the last resort for related SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Most of the potential interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be ruled out or accepted in further studies.
First, bats may be the main branch of the infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can combine the environment with bats by cutting meat or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the expansionary intermediates through which the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus was introduced.
Humans are infected by the disease through the slaughter and consumption of animal flesh.
It is likely that most mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is no doubt that there is a need for a study of domestic animals and of rats for protection.
Third, as mentioned above, re-adaptation and adaptation to SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species related to bats and pangolins.
Animal-derived SARS-CoV-2 origin testing is still underway.
In addition to the distinct animal vectors, there are three other important factors about the disease in the transmission of CoVs from the host to the host.
First, their abundance is altered in RNA cleavage.
Compared to other single RNA molecules, the estimators of the mutation rate of CoVs can be considered as Medium to high with an average active mutation rate of ~10-4 mutations per year by site 2, depending on the adaptation pattern of the CoV to the novel host.
CoVs have evidence of re-inhibiting exoribonuclease, a deletion that causes a highly complex and debilitating or non-sustaining process.
However, interestingly, the genetic basis of the virus is usually inhibited by the CoV by binding to RNA molecules.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than that of their host group.
In addition, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not adapted to their host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is very low, suggesting a higher level of acceptance for humans.
Perhaps he was already familiar with a sick person who lived near people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is specific to single-celled camels.
In theory, it is not necessary that the genome sequence can produce vaccines and immunizations against SARS-CoV-2 that are not as effective.
Second, the large RNA molecule in the body of the CoVs revealed the origin of the mutations and mutations that the genetic roots of the CoVs cause, which further facilitates their interspecies mutation which helps to trigger the emergence of novel CoVs when they have the desired adaptation.
This is supported by the abundance of open special-purpose libraries and the usefulness of protein coding by the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, Covs can alter the structure of RNA by unwanted and repeatedly decomposing it through a special copy-selective process.
In the host cell, transcription occurs frequently during replication of CoV RNA.
The development of full-length and genomic versions of recombinant RNAs to produce novel CoVs.
Evidence of genetic origin has been obtained from the genetic sequences of both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as from animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The origin and transmission of the virus.
In addition to the three factors mentioned above about the virus, interaction of the virus with the host host is another factor that influences the dispersal between the genome types.
Here, SARS-CoV is again included as a common example, which also demonstrates positive selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative tests between human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, it is thought that SARS-CoV may be able to adapt rapidly to different host species, particularly with mutations in the S-type RBD protein.
In general, RBD in the S protein of CoV interacts with the receptor cell and the immune system.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to 510th amino acid sequence on the S1 subunit, which binds to human ACE2 as well as binds to the receptor for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to identify ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, which allows the virus to spread between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acids have been observed to be distinct from human and viral civet isolates in RBD and 4 of them are in the carrier chain for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The animal SARS-CoV Sivet has K479N and S487T mutations in RBD, which may increase the proximity of protein-mineral interactions with human ACE2 receptor.
In short, these amino acid substitutions can be very important for the reception of antibodies in the human body.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 subunit of the S protein suggests that the end of the S protein-human ACE2 relationship may be variable.
Indeed, cryo-EM studies show a 10 to 20 times higher correlation of this factor than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to know whether any other receptor will be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a S-subunit.
There are other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may be responsible for successfully balancing the availability of these CoVs in humans after transmitting the virus from their host animals.
In addition to the host gene, the effects of interspecies transmission of HCoVs are also controlled by other host-dependent and restriction factors.
The distribution of these proteins between humans and the genetic residues of HCoVs in groups such as bats, camels and rats may be a barrier to infectious transmission.
HCoVs must overcome their reliance on shelter and then overcome their shelter constraints for successful dispersal between different species.
In this regard, the genetic code in this important area of viral interaction and its host is still being identified and can be identified.
The analysis of the inconsistency patterns around the dependency of shelter and restraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may be useful.
HCoVs outbreak: Back to zero
Variation of bat CoVs provides sufficient opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs that are different.
Based on this hypothesis, bat-borne CoVs are the source of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic regeneration also drive HCoV development and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the sale or loss of the genetic material of a world-class protein has the potential to alter the genetic makeup of a virus in some way.
Of the proteins that protect against SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as is SARS-CoV associated with bat viruses that were isolated but have been found to have different chemical properties than the ORF8 protein.
29 mutations from the SARS-CoVs strain were detected in blood early in the human outbreak.
This deletion transfers ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation that promotes the translocation of proteins.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has the potential to reverse history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of replication regions in RNA polymerases that are RNA-dependent have been identified.
Reverse transcriptase sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak has been shown to have cross-linkage events between different strains, which occurred in single-celled organisms in Saudi Arabia.
Alongside SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mutations have also been observed in some HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in non-organic genomes.
It should also be warned that human selection can contribute to unexpected changes in genes, perhaps caused by the release of pathogens from an extreme selection, such as the immune system.
An example of these effects is the full-length loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E specimen cell, resulting from two nucleotide deletions.
While positive ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses that are related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of alpaca camels exhibits a single nucleotide, resulting in frameshift mutations.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their host reservoir.
A marker of infection or only symptoms was found when the Jemaahs were infected with CoVs, suggesting a similarity between CoVs and bats.
She explained that bats are the genetic hub of CoVs monitoring their physiology and how their organs function.
For example, defects in the anti-inflammatory response discs in bats effectively reduced the harm caused by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of the killer gene in bats is impaired by elevated levels of the killer gene receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression of major class I antigen complexes.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by bat's drug activity can suppress the CoV virus's replication and affect the readability of the receptor, thus creating selective pressure for highly reactive viral replication when introduced into a new host.
Pathogenic CoV infections can also be mutated by regeneration, which causes protein forms or protein sequences to adapt.
Thus, there is no way that three HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause minor symptoms in the intestines of infected individuals such as mice and camels.
They can spread rapidly without showing any immune response from the infected person.
Here lies the mystery of why asymptomatic cases are seen and the cause of the serious cases in human infection.
The symptoms are caused by the immune system's efforts to fight off the disease, which can cause severe damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic individuals, the immune response was lower to the spread of Cov.
The same strategy of sharing linkages and immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least at the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be effective.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in bats has side effects.
Note that for this reason, the survival of the NLRP3 gene and its mutation with MCC950 would be influential in curing COVID-19.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 followed a trend in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
Whereas a beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bacterial-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Given that livestock sivets and other livestock in markets have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate SARS-CoV-2 pathogen has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs with high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute fragments of antibodies to the final form of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally human-made.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV infections in bats and other animals has changed our view of the importance of the HcoVs virus source being animal-derived in transmitting to humans.
A growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of bacterial origin and are transmitted to humans by central nervous system.
Given that the SARS-CoV virus originated from human-to-human contact with civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing the cities that are affected could end the SARS virus.
For the same reasons, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission of disease from animals to humans, considering the study of the identification of the origin of the disease in many pangolins from beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, how or whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals will still be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists in Arabian camels.
These camels were vital for transportation and were a major source of meat, milk, hides, and wool for the local people.
They are found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is almost impossible to call for the cancellation of all camels just to control the MERS virus, as was done in the pet market in mainland China to control the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.
To stop the spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective immunity to MERS-CoV for camels, along with other infection control measures.
If we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new pathogens may emerge that could cause disease.
Most zoonotic CoVs are transmitted in the wild.
For example, rat CoVs derived from animal bodies are rampant.
There is considerable evidence that CoVs are co-infections with a mutation into a CoVs virus that is rapidly infecting humans and may become more lethal in the future.
The practice of cannibalism in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce the unhealthy interaction between humans and animals.
Given the prevalence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, it is necessary to plan for a specific response.
In fact, many germs have existed on earth for a long time.
They remain in their original storage rooms until the possibility of spreading is established.
Although bats have many features that are more likely to transmit viruses, the chance of human interaction with bats and other wildlife species could be reduced if people were taught to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the biological nature of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
The most reliable way to prevent the spread of disease from animals to humans is for humans to keep animals that carry the disease at bay.
Much of the evidence in the show regarding the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see what conditions bats and pangolin species might experience in the same environment.
Second, if bats play a role in transmitting the disease to humans, how can contact between humans and bats be guaranteed?
Third, if the third mammal becomes a true central host, how it interacts with species including humans, bats and pangolins must be clarified.
Finally, the observation that most mammals including domestic animals can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, should be subject to specific investigation.
Whether it is a Jemage, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent strains that are nearly identical are expected to be detected in its natural habitat in the near future.
Further research in this area will allow for the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated COVID-19 testing guidelines for suspected and previously diagnosed cases are required
On 6 February 2020, our organization published a rapid advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 norovirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guide provided us with our expertise and provided a more comprehensive reflection on the fight against this global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on advanced research and clinical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we provide a single response to our guidance and provide a new diagnostic status for suspected cases and confirmed cases based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Control Guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and this was published online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our expertise and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical expertise; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines Review for COVID-19 issued by the Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, announced a total of seven editions with some significantly changing contexts.
Now that our leadership has received feedback from Zhou et al., they have proposed a simple model based on clinical experience.
Their actions added new evidence for our guidance and gave a deeper meaning to this global scourge.
We are proud of their vital work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Test Version 7) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to establish a presumption required a combination of either one element of epidemiological history with two elements of clinical symptoms to make a thorough diagnosis, or a combination of three elements of clinical symptoms if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 infection was reported within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 skin infections (with valid nucleic acid testing);(3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported within the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms;(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((())))))
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory tract infection symptoms; (2) with technical signs of COVID-19 infection; (3) abnormal white blood cell count, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stages.
Confirmed case diagnosis should be based on suspected presence with any of the following single pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a viral image or video of all the biological systems showing high susceptibility to known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in SARG-CoV-2-IgG specific IgG from negative to positive, or a titer rising ≥4 times during the recovery period of a critically ill patient.
We can see that the actual PCR test of the actual nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples has been increased to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Blood clots were further identified in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was further confirmed in the seventh edition.
These corrections associated with the researchers continued the work that to test for a valid virus rapidly, samples from the respiratory tract including a blood sample, which increased the production of various samples, and supported the production of specific antibody results in proven models.
Besides, there is much more evidence that reminds us to be careful with sick patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the list of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
A continuous quality system is also needed to ensure quality in clinical practice and education.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence that comes with an invitation to readers to express their opinions.
For diagnoses of undiagnosed and diagnosed diseases, we recommend identifying and following the latest national guidelines.
Our organization will also update its response to the need for relief.

Reports indicate that buyers have been holding back goods based on fears of COVID-19 and quarantine measures.
On Wednesdays, Woolworths bought enough toilet paper to deliver one package per order.
These changes followed the four-package or any-trade restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in his report dated March 8, said that the fourth step was to set a maximum number of stores selling goods within one hour of drop-off, and called the need for a decentralized approach to it and ALDI in a Facebook post on Tuesday called it unexpected.
Sales rose rapidly last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's stores in Canberra reduced sales to two-fold in the last week.
To keep the shortage down, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased deliveries, Woolworths ordered more stock, while ALDI invested for a special Wednesday program to start early.
Russell Zimmerman, chairman of the local trade association, said small traders were trying to increase their inventory, but local measures on the timing of their vehicles' arrivals were becoming difficult.
He expected to see higher manufacturing costs in an effort to meet such special needs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial stock release, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday specials.
In News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer reports that Small Business Analyst from the University of Queensland, says stores are filling up with vendors every night.
He said that toilet paper is too much, which makes it so scarce, and that when it is sold out, they leave the bread in storage, which makes the shortage worse.
""Coles and Woolworths have the view [that] if there are more products on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and cleaning supplies [are] also available in quantity, then perhaps the panic will be reduced"" Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News".
The recycler of toilet paper Who gives Crap said that on the last Wednesday they will expire.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some sellers were giving away free tickets to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, when a short auction was held because buyers were away on holiday for the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of the New Testament contains eight pages that are meant to be cut up for use as a book report.
Shops First Demonstrated Inaction to Take Steps, as ABC Australia reported on 3 March that they said there was no Plan to Curb Politics.
Russell Zimmerman added some much-needed supplies, including face shields, hand soaps, dryers, hand sanitizers, and even a hand sanitizer.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was noted that the British business website Ocado limited the sale of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
The day the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak and the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2 as a pandemic.
Although the term anoba refers to a person who is contagious, not a person who is at risk of infection, WHO has called for government intervention in the fight.
All countries of the world can still change the nature of this pandemic.
if countries can identify, test, treat, diagnose, and send their people to the emergency services,  said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
""We are deeply concerned both by the levels of violence and the spread of the disease and the levels of indifference"""
Dr Tom Frienden, former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the pandemic was unknown.
"He said, in a speech published by CNN in February, ""apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has spread from concern to global spread""".
Ghebreyesus also testified where he added that there has never been an outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
"He continued, ""and we have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time""".
The new epidemic status follows a decision by WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""The end of the story, it will be terrible""".
The Associated Press reports that the total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide has now reached 126,000 and 4,600 people have died from the infection.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 COVID-19 virus caused by SARS-COV-2.
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a High Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and was confirmed on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 were cured.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while the global share varies between 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
The main symptoms include fever and cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and respiratory disease.
The period from the onset of symptoms to the onset of symptoms is about five days, but can last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment for eliminating it.
Primary Care involves providing protection by taking simple, protective measures including hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people at a distance, and treating and isolating people who are infected or suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by taking measures such as restricting movement, quarantining, curfew, enforcing workplace safety regulations and closing factories.
The pandemic has caused severe global economic turmoil, cancellation or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and an abundance of goods that has led to fearful purchases.
Schools and universities have closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting at least 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misunderstandings about the virus have spread online, and there have been incidents of racial comments and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people and their appearance, and others from areas with significant infection rates.
The suspension of travel and closure of major industries has resulted in a decrease in air pollution.
Health authorities in Wuhan reported that the case of pneumonia was identified on 31 December 2019 and subsequent investigations were launched in early January 2020.
Most cases are related to the aquatic products market in Huanan and so the disease is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, the newly discovered virus is related to the gemage coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first person identified with symptoms was later diagnosed as ill on 1 December 2019 , and the person was not apparently related to a previously marketed whooping cough.
From the first collection of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were identified as being market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that an outbreak had started on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, possibly the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, while new cases were reported in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases in China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a high incidence of the disease, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, there were no fewer cases among young people, aged 19 and under, who made up less than 2.4% of the global population.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected before an effective vaccine was achieved.
The situation shows the number of people who have undergone a COVID-19 test and tested positive for the disease based on official confirmation.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of the virus and most countries had received official orders to test even those with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were reported, and these unconfirmed infections accounted for 79% of the recorded infections.
An analysis of statistics published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than reported.
The initial estimates of the original reproductive code (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 5.7 kg.
Most people who are infected with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from onset of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020 the estimated COVID-19-related death toll was 97,000.
In China, as of 5 February, nearly 80% of the deaths were among those over 60, and 75% had medical conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The equivalent of a primary death from COVID-19 generally refers to people who died who tested positive for COVID according to official criteria.
The number of COVID-19 deaths is likely to be higher as there are more deaths from untested cases, such as those at home and those in nursing homes.
a regional data centre in Italy found that the death toll during the pandemic exceeded the COVID death toll by 4-5 times.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged ""We know that [the reported death toll] is alarming"", citing intelligence sources such as the U.S. Secret Service. Such ignorance often occurs in emergencies, such as the 2009 swine H1N1 virus outbreak. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, China's front line reported more than a dozen deaths in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories declared deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and time period, and are influenced by the number of trials, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, since when the outbreak first began, and demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The numbers vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (of those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (of those with symptoms from 1 February 2020).Other measures included a mortality rate that measures the number of people who have been cured of a disease and died.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection by smallpox.
Many of the experts have tried to figure out how to calculate the population of a particular population.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence Studies estimates that the overall infection rate of the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high scores of this range are consistent with results from the first COVID-19 tests in Germany, and statistical studies analyzing the impact of the tests on CFR scores.
WHO confirms that the epidemic can be controlled.
The intensity and duration of the sleep are uncertain and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Bony from Penn State University explained that if left untreated the outbreak will rise and then decline as the virus loses its host.
But it is almost impossible to predict when that will be.
Senior health advisor to the Chinese government Zhong Nashan believes that the pandemic could be ended by June if the international community follows WHO recommendations for measures to limit the spread of the virus.
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 ""will circulate in countries, probably for a year or two""".
"According to the Imperial College of Physicians a study led by Neil Ferguson, Social Distancing and Other Measures will be maintained until a vaccine is available (at least 18 months or more)".
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus - because it's so easily transmitted - will go away completely"" and """"it could be a modern disease, returning every year""".
The severity of the virus depends on the immune system's response to infection and the state of the body's genes.
COVID-19 symptoms may be nonspecific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and even a dry cough (68%).
Other minor symptoms include fatigue, phlegm, numbness, shortness of breath, joint and body pain, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, or cyanosis.WHO reports that about one in six people are ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, painless waking, and a clear face or lips; emergency medical advice is recommended if these symptoms are present.Progressive disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome with no symptoms, nausea, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with positive test results, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and screened to avoid transmission.
The Chinese estimate of total asymptomatic varies from a low of 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset) ranges from one to 14 days; most cases are five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimated incubation rate of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell and smell ranges from 30% and then drops to 15%.
Some speculation about how the disease is spreading is being investigated.
There is a risk of initial transmission of the disease at contact with the host and then by drops obtained during coughing or sneezing or speaking and by being within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) of a person.
Research has found that an uncovered cough can cause a stinging spider whose wand can reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can be spread by water inhaled in the air for long periods of time and then transmitted by mouth, and that respiratory droplets can be transmitted by breathing in or speaking.
The virus can be passed through the mouth or nose of someone nearby or inhaled into the esophagus.
Some health-related measures, such as inhaling and exhaling and cardiovascular therapy, can be a source of airborne disease.
It can also be spread when a person touches an infected object, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While it can be transmitted by the bite of a mosquito, the risk is very low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of SaRS-CoV-2 by mouth-to-mouth transmission.The virus is more transmissible three days after onset of symptoms but is likely to spread before symptoms appear or before it progresses to stage two of infection.
Tests have shown that people have been infected for up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that there is a possibility of infection before symptoms appear.
While few laboratory reports confirm the low prevalence, severe cases have been reported in some countries during the ongoing outbreak investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Control has announced that one person can spread the virus to two or three others.
In particular, the virus was detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in carton, and for four hours on copper.
This, however, varies depending on the smell and body temperature.Pets and other animals have been found to be infected with COVID-19 following testing.
There is no evidence that an animal can transmit the disease to humans, but the UK Food and Drug Administration recommends that people wash their hands after contact with an animal or other areas that may be touched by an infected person.
SARS-COV-2 is a new strain of the virus that was first identified in three patients with acute respiratory syndrome pneumonia in Wuhan, China.
All the features of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from the same family coronavirus in their genome. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by local soap, which dissolves the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is related to the SARS-CoV strain.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is related to the Betacoronavirus gene, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (genus B) with two bacterial strains found.
96% less showed partial perfection during the formation of the hallita cells compared to the Bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered the presence of a hallitavirus in the salivary glands and its link between the virus and the human body.
Comparison of the genetic material found that 92% of the coronavirus pangolin is similar to SARS-COV-2.
Viral infection can be detected by symptoms, although final confirmation is by the bacterial polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) technique of infection or CT imaging.
A study combining PCR and CT in Wuhan suggested that CT was more rapid than PCR, despite its short duration, and more likely to detect the progression of some colds and other illnesses.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used for diagnostic or as a primary test for COVID-19""".
WHO published the first version of the SARS-COV-2 strain test on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A test may be taken from a breathing tube or even a blood sample.
The full results are seen within a few hours to a few days.
This test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab although a throat swab may be used.Most laboratories and companies perform serological tests, which detect the bacteria.
As of 6 April 2020, all of these have not been validated for the prevalence of the disease.
In the U.S. a serological test developed by Cellex is approved for safe emergency use in an approved laboratory.
Characteristic features of imaging in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical ground glass patterns and discomfort symptoms.
The Italian Radiological Society compiles an online database of diagnostic findings for confirmed cases worldwide.
As a result of circulation with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity for COVID-19 detection.
A major study in China compared chest X-ray results with genetic results and found that the virus was more rapidly transmitted and more dangerous, and recommended a change in testing methods in areas with high prevalence.
Artificial neural networks are designed to detect viral patterns with radio and CT images.
Prevention strategies include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in paper and putting the paper in the trash.
Those already infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Avoiding contact with one another is also part of the measures taken to control the spread of the disease.Most governments have recommended restricting travel and importation to affected countries.
The response to the disease has reached a level of inter-communal transmission in parts of the world.
This indicates that the virus is spreading in communities, and some local residents are not aware of where or how they have been exposed to the disease.Healthcare professionals are advising infected people to use protective clothing, contact lenses, eye protection.Tracking contacts is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent it from spreading.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or introduced for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a number of expert groups are working on private networks, such as using Bluetooth to access the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users received a message that if they came into contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19, their misunderstanding of how to prevent infection was spreading; for example, washing the nose and even the mouth does not protect against death from the disease.
There is no cure for COVID-19 but organizations are trying to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap at all times for at least 20 minutes, especially after visiting the toilet or if their hands are dirty; immediately after passing stool, coughing or taking a bath.
This is because outside the body, the bacteria can be killed by soap, which breaks down the protective pigment.
The CDC adds that 60% alcohol hand sanitizer should be used when no soap or water is available.
WHO recommends people to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth without washing their hands.
The pathogenic bacteria can be washed off the surface by a number of treatments (within one minute of exposure to a corrosive to stainless steel), a mixture of 62-71 percent ethanol, 50-100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5 percent povidone-iodine.
Other antibiotics such as Benzalkonium chloride and Chrohexidine were less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected if confirmed or confirmed in an office such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, private keyboards, remotes, and ATM machines used by patients, should be dispersed.
Health organizations advise the public to cover their mouth and nose by bending their elbows or using a towel while coughing or sneezing and to ensure that towels are disposed of immediately afterward.
The use of a surgical mask is recommended for those who may have been infected, as wearing a mask may reduce the frequency of dissemination of external bleeding during speech, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Leeds University virology expert Stephen Griffin, wearing a face mask reduces the risk of hand-to-hand contact with the skin, which is one of the main causes of infection if hands are not washed properly.
WHO recommends wearing face masks to healthy patients if they are part of a high-risk group, for example someone caring for COVID-19 patients, although they agree that wearing face masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to promote the use of face coverings for their citizens.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face coverings made of fabric.China specifically recommends the use of disposable face masks by healthy public members, especially if they are in close proximity (1 meter (3 ft) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong has mandated that face masks be worn when entering vehicles and public places.
Health officials in Thailand are increasingly encouraging people to wear face masks at home and wash them regularly.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government has mandated that anyone entering a soup kitchen must wear a mask.
Israel Ordered Residents to Wear Face Coverings When Going Out in the Community
Taiwan, which has been exporting around 10 million sunscreen units since mid-March, required passengers on trains and buses to wear face coverings from 1 April.
Panama mandates that a mask be worn by all citizens when going out.It recommends that traditional masks be used if there is no tendency to buy the original product.
The opposite trend is seen in Japan, South Africa, Malaysia, Korea and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control practices aimed at reducing the spread of the disease by limiting close contact between people.
Measures included quarantine, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, sports venues or shopping malls.
Many people can take advantage of social distancing measures by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding crowded places, using greetings without a proper face-to-face, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now authorizing or recommending that people stay away from areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced to 250 (if there was no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50, then to 10.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned social gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and immune system disorders are at high risk of developing dementia and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay indoors throughout the entire period of the outbreak. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health authorities began replacing the use of the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", to clarify that the goal is to reduce the amount of physical contact during social gatherings, whether real or close".
The concept of social distancing has replaced the public's minds with total isolation without looking back to interacting with the public in a different way.
It includes the recommendation to have sex with someone who lives in the same environment and/or who does not have the virus or its symptoms.
Coronavirus patients are advised to quarantine at home with those suspected of having COVID-19 in their area.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines on how to quarantine.Several governments have issued orders or recommended quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
Stronger quarantine orders were issued for those in extreme danger.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to another country or region with contagious transmission are advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last exposure.
The strategies involved in controlling outbreaks are prevention, and mitigation.
Efforts are being made to slow the outbreak in the early stages with the aim of identifying and isolating the infected as well as introducing other infection control and prevention measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are then moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread of the disease and its impact on the health system and society.
Prevention and reduction measures can be implemented at the same time.
The summary calls for more stringent measures to reverse the outbreak by reducing the original incidence rate to less than 1.The CDC is trying to slow the spread of the disease, known as the outbreak reversal.
This reduces the risk of medical procedures being delayed and allows more time for vaccination and treatment.
Non-medical prevention that can prevent an outbreak includes personal protective measures, such as, wearing a face mask, and self-isolation; social distancing measures such as closing schools and preventing large gatherings; community solidarity to encourage adoption and governance of such precautions; and environmental measures such as sanitation of floors.
Other countries have also taken several measures to slow the spread of the disease.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and home quarantine, and issued a warning against the spread of infectious diseases.
Singapore provides financial support to those who self-isolate and makes a heavy loss to those who fail to do so.
Taiwan has increased the use of face masks and sanctions against medical masks.British and US measures show that both the situation (reducing the spread of the disease but not preventing it) and the situation (reversing the spread of the disease) are very challenging.
A strategy to reduce the spread of the disease could lead to a reduction in healthcare needs by two thirds and mortality by half. It could also lead to the death of hundreds of thousands of people with overcrowded healthcare systems.
The suppression stage is used more often for the duration of the virus circulation in the human body (or until a vaccine is developed) because transmission can change its mode of transmission when the stage is relaxed.
Long-term interventions to eradicate the disease have led to high social and economic costs.
There is no definitive cure for COVID-19 but it is still being developed in clinical trials.
Taking medication and heavy drinking along with rest can help to reduce the severity of the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, treatment may require oxygenation and fluid inhalation along with respiration.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the effects.
Many compounds that are approved for the treatment of some common diseases are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO added that some traditional medicines may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
The mobilization and delivery of healthcare reform to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is an urgent and urgent action as defined by WHO.
ECDC and WHO's European regional office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to shift resources at multiple levels, including laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, canceling appointment procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and building intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the availability of ventilators and beds.
There are several theories about where the disease originated (the type of carrier) from which it spread.
The first known case of the Coronavirus can be traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei has gradually increased.
These are often associated with the Huanan Water Fountain Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the disease originated from one of the animal species; or, in short, it is of zoonotic origin.An unidentified pneumonia cluster was observed on 26 December and doctor Zhang Jixian appeared at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which notified Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by police for spreading false rumors, and then another senior official, Ai Fen, reprimanded her for the alarm issue.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Authority later issued a public notice on 31 December with a notification to the WHO.
A number of unidentified cases were reported to health authorities in Wuhan for investigation in early January.During the early period of the outbreak, the infection rate doubled roughly every seven and a half days in a short period.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, using New China and Wuhan as transportation hubs and major railway interchange.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two cases here in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later data showed that 6,174 people had been infected with the virus as of 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least one case is reported in 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, several countries under the Schengen Agreement have restricted movement to create a border control.
National considerations include measures to reduce the spread of the disease such as quarantine (i.e. stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or even city closures) and a state of emergency.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people were under lockdown in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people were under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were under lockdown in India.
As of 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people in two days - almost a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report said the first since 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian was diagnosed with a rare pneumonia on December 26, which prompted her hospital to notify the Wuhan Jianghan provincial infectious disease control agency on December 27.
The first human genome sequence analysis of a patient was conducted on 27 December 2019 and showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
A full Public Notice was issued by the Wuhan Health Authority on 31 December.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified on the same day.
"As these announcements took place, the police warned Wuhan doctors against ""spreading rumors"" about the outbreak".
The Chinese National Health Administration initially claimed that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a follow-up plan described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a ""people's war"" to contain the spread of the virus".
In what has been described as "the largest mass isolation in human history", a cordon sanitaire was announced on 23 January to restrict travel in and out of Wuhan, which was later extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people.
Public transportation is prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebration (January 25) has been canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
A further hospital was built later, Leishenshan Hospital, to treat more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as tournament venues and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing travel health warnings and extending the Spring Festival season.
Universities and schools across the country are also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken special measures in relation to schools and universities.
Several initiatives have been launched in many areas of China.
Restrictions on travel in and around Hubei.
Public transportation has been transformed with temporary closures of historical sites in China.
"Movement controls have been imposed in many cities, and it is estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of curfew.After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from ""importing"" from other countries".
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day curfew on all international travelers entering the city.On 23 March, mainland China issued the only domestic entry ban in the past five days, by this route for a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of the disease had been contained and an outbreak had been detected in China.

Most competitive leagues have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League season, the 2019-20 UEFA Premier League season, UEFA euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
"The explosion of plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that ""the event will be rescheduled until 2020 but not later than summer 2021"".Casinos and other gambling venues worldwide have been closed and domestic tournaments have either been rescheduled or suspended".
This has led to a resurgence of online gambling where gambling sites are increasingly attracting new members.The issue has been particularly acute in the entertainment sector where most music clubs have restricted or cancelled their games.
Many television networks such as the one on Broadway have banned all shows.
Some gamer cooperatives have developed ways to integrate and share their work online instead of the traditional public way of playing, such as watching instant video online and even creating codes on websites for gamers to play and promote their games.
The social media has seen a proliferation of viral images and coronavirus scandals as many of them focus on entertainment to distract from the uncertainty of the end of the pandemic.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, discrimination, racism, and bigotry against Chinese and Middle Eastern people, as well as people from war zones in Europe, the United States and other countries, have been rampant.
The fear, criticism, and kidnapping scandal has been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Pacific.
Reports from February (when the number of cases was the highest in China) contained data on how the rest of the world was racially biased and insulting Chinese nationals.
Some Kashmiris in Africa have seen more ethnic discrimination against Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported racial discrimination based on their local origin.
Support is provided to Chinese, online and offline, and to those in the worst affected areas.
Following the continuing outbreak in some new countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, may face harassment and racism. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have begun signing petitions to ban Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to contain the outbreak.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been influential on Twitter.
Chinese and Asian residents in the UK and the U.S. reported increased racism, including attacks.
US President Donald Trump Faces Criticism for Calling Coronavirus the "Chinese Virus", a term that critics see as a racist anti-Chinese slogan
Protesters in Ukraine attacked vehicles carrying citizens and other refugees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India bordering China, studying in different cities of India face scrutiny due to Coronavirus outbreak.
The Bharatiya Janata Party regional president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese have corrupted the culture and therefore God has taken vengeance on them.
"The Chinese Labor Party later condemned the speech in Kolkata, calling it ""a mistake"".In China, the outbreak of racism and discrimination against Chinese residents was not sparked by the outbreak, with foreigners being described as ""foreign garbage"" and intended to be ""dumped"".
Most newspapers have removed the Wall Street Journal in all their One Stop Corona coverage.
Many scientific publishers have placed scientific papers related to the epidemic available for general reading.
Some scientists have chosen to publish their results over time via the bioRxiv publishing software.
Rapid viral outbreak - A viral outbreak, often in an outbreak or transmission environment
Global and disease - Global appearance and spread of disease
List of epidemics and diseases - List of deaths from cholera
Wildlife poisoning and zoonoses - Health risks associated with the high-cost wildlife trade.
The laboratory test for the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 infection includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced as a result of infection.
RT-PCR detects viral DNA in samples, which detects coronavirus RNA.
The test is specifically designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to diagnose a disease that has been diagnosed or is in the process of being diagnosed.
Serology is used for testing and monitoring of populations.
An immunoassay reveals how many people are infected, including those with few reported symptoms.
The number of female deaths caused by the disease and the immune system in humans can be determined by a test.
Due to a lack of testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
As of 23 March, No country had tested 3% of the national population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests across countries.
This discrepancy may also affect the relevance of the reporting of the prevalence of infections, which may be more highly valued in some countries.
Using real-time repetitive plymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the respiratory tract can be tested derived from various sources, including nasopharyngeal repetition or sputum samples.
results are usually seen in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests can detect a throat swab but are only possible in the first week of infection.
The virus then disappears into the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For those who are infected and tested in the second week, a sample may also be taken from the respiratory tract using a catheter or sputum.
One of the PCR tests was developed at Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and generated a database of 250,000 items for distribution from the World Health Organization (WHO).
The European continent included a test on 23 January 2020.The North Korean company Kogenebiotech obtained a new, PCR-based SAR-CoV-2 test substance (Powercheck Corona virus) on 28 January 2020.
"It seeks ""E"" shared by all beta coronaviruses, and RdRp specific genes for SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Health Administration for PCS-CoV-2 fat-detection products-In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is distributing the novel Coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) Time-Ready RT-PCR Clinical Trials to public health facilities through the International Reagent Resource".
One of the test cells had one that became incomplete due to a compound problem and at the edge of a CDD test bottle in Atlanta; this resulted in nearly 100 samples being identical in February 2020.
The use of two-component testing has not been shown to be effective as of 28 February 2020, and until the states and laboratories are allowed to test.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Management Act. The US drug testing laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of a nationwide COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics has made nationwide COVID-19 testing available from 9 March 2020
No quantity limit is announced, samples taken and processed must be made according to CDC requirements
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and is controlled by the State Research Institute for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 a test was submitted from the Federal Service for Surveilance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported that a COVID-19 test system was available. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to perform the test in a maximum of 3.5 hours, although they would allow the machine to perform up to 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute trial.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid dilation technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require any weather system, the method can produce a positive result in five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these in the US and Abbott expects to produce 50,000 more tests per day.A test containing monoclonal antibodies that eliminate the nucleacapsid protein (N Protein) of the coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation that it can give results in 15 to 20 minutes as fast as the flu.
"A review of the March 2020 literature concluded that ""chest radiographs are of little value for diagnosis in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] scans may be available even before symptoms appear"."
CT scans include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities and periheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
The spread of the disease is accompanied by increased subpleural inflammation, skin cracking and stretching.
A review of PCR testing to CT in Wuhan as the source of the current outbreak showed that CT was more infectious than PCR, although it was not specific, and many imaging techniques were associated with certain pneumonia and infectious processes.
In March 2020. "The American College of Radiology recommended that CT be used instead of early COVID-19 testing"".In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early testing".
The immune system's main defense against infection is the stimulation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect people who have been infected with the disease beginning 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, for preventive detection, and to monitor the population.
High-throughput automated machines in many hospital laboratories can perform these tests but availability will depend on the quantity produced for each machine.
For CLT a single lateral blood sample is commonly used, although dummy samples can be used daily to monitor immunity.
PoCT a single sample of blood on the forehead through a skin incision.
Unlike PCR methods no pre-assay level of development is required.On March 26, 2020, the FDA allowed 29 individuals to provide notification to the authorities as required and now have the ability to distribute their own immunoassay.
The FDA approved the test on April 7, 2020, under the Emergency Use Authorization at the end of March 2020.Euriommum Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their antibody products that can detect IgG and igA antibodies against the virus in a blood sample.
The test size range is a few hundred samples in hours and is much faster than the PCR assay of conventional viral RNA.
Antibodies can be detected 14 days after the onset of the disease.As of early April, the UK had not received any antibody test kits that were commercially available.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where those who are confirmed to be infected stay at home, ""the emergency department will provide a sample tube to patients"", spit in the stomach, send it to them and have a future test result.The UK NHS has announced a pilot scheme for testing positive at home, which eliminates the risk of spreading the virus from patients to others when they arrive at the hospital or by washing the virus from the car and ambulance carcasses if used.By making COVID-19 tests common to suspected infected, healthcare professionals can take precautions to prevent the use or spread of the sample".
The nearby testing facilities have enabled South Korea to conduct the fastest and most cost-effective testing in any country.In Germany, doctors at the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in the system and 10,700 were performed last week.
The cost of the insurance when the doctor ordered the test.
According to the school's director Robert Koch, the Jamaus has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
From 19 March, a large number of tests were conducted in major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of confirmed cases in Germany is unknown, except for the cases of the virus.
"Preliminary laboratory tests confirmed that in the week of 12/2020 approximately 483,295 samples were tested up to and including the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9 percent) showed positive for SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and performed a test pattern for testing samples from 64 nurses, through a randomized sampling assay to ensure that only a complex sample was confirmed.In Wuhan a 2000-sq-meter rapid test lab called Huo-Yan (Chinese: 火, or ""Fire Eye"" in English) was opened by BGI on 5 February 2020, which can test approximately 10,000 samples per day".
With the construction supervisor, BGI founder Wang Jian, the 5-day trial showed a positive rate in Hubei of over 47% and the same cost for quarantine would be double the cost where the test rate would not be online.
The Wuhan laboratory is operated by the Hou-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in all 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020 the total number of tests per day reached 50,000.The Open Source, Multilexed test was designed and released by Origami Assays to test a sample of 1122 COVID-19 cases using 93 assays without the need for robotic water handlers.
In March, shortages and lack of reagents prevented many delays in the European Union (EU) as well as the UK and the US.
This led some authors to read the preparation of a prototype of the process which involved heating the sample at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates had started testing coronavirus in its population more than any other country, and was working to increase the testing rate to reach the entire population.
This was achieved through a combination of drive-through testing, the purchase of population-scale mass-throughput testing equipment from 42 organizations and BGI (based on Huo-Yan emergency diagnostic laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab can perform 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first to operate outside China.
Various test kits for coronavirus molecular sequences have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hon Kon, Japan, and the U.S.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German system of testing controls that are being deployed to low-income countries that lack the resources to control their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; an agreement with the US Centers for Disease Control was not reached until 28 January, delaying the production of tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the safety of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia failed to produce enough wearables to satisfy the demands and recommendations of health professionals.
In addition, experts say the increased testing capacity in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The experimental environment, usually private laboratories have been built for decades by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization said that testing was the most effective and efficient way to control the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for eggs as the disease spread delayed testing in U.S. laboratories and the provision of samples and test chemicals was dangerous.
In March 2020 China reported problems affecting the quality of the equipment.
In the United States, a test that was sent from the CDC had problems and the government removed the partition that prevented commercial laboratories from working.Spain purchased a test from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology co ltd and found that the results were not good.
The company explains that the incorrect results can be the result of a failure to properly assemble the products or use the equipment.
The Spanish authorities said they would remove the negative test kits, and replace them with other variants of Shnghen Bioeasy, 80% of the Czech Republic's test kits purchased in China had negative results.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that it be placed in the Danube Ates Kara of the Turkish health officials said the test kit purchased by Turkey from China was highly defective and not in use.The UK had purchased about 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 said this could not be used.
Testing, follow-up and quarantine of confirmed cases and search for contacts of infected SaRS-CoV-2 individuals who have had adverse contact that leads to infection.
Researchers working in the Italian state of VO in the area where the first deaths from COVID-19 were detected in Italy, conducted a series of trials on an entire population of 3,400, about ten days apart.
About half of the infected do not show symptoms and all those who are infected are isolated.
In the case of traffic control, this eliminates some of the infections altogether.
With the tracking of contacts, domestic travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore is moving more slowly than in other developed countries and regions, but there are no restrictions such as restaurant closures and food stands.
All other events were suspended, with Singapore issuing a stay-at-home order on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March.
Many countries have prevented the spread of the disease by tracking contacts, restricting travel, testing and travel of infected people with their own quarantine but not restricting people from travelling, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies show that countries with high testing, which affects mortality, have fewer cases, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with few or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five confirmed tests and a sample of ten unconfirmed COVID-19 samples one out of 16 of the WHO laboratory confirmation test.
Of the 16 laboratory samples, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, 1 in Australia.
In these charts, a confidence factor such as % of tests is influenced by the national test system.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospitals will have a high rate of success as a % of all tests on citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, if all other factors are consistent.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is a method of washing hands to remove dirt, grease, particles, or other unwanted debris.
"Regular hand washing with soap and soap ""at critical times"" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted by the oral route".
People can also contract pneumonia or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
Five times a day are particularly important for hand washing with soap and detergent: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning and changing the baby's napkin, before feeding the child, before eating, before and after cooking, and after handling raw food, fish or farm products.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with soap and ash, WHO recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after cooking.
before and after visiting a patient.
After changing a child's diaper or cleaning a child's toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After handling animal waste, animal feces, and animal bones.
The cleanliness of medical procedures refers to the cleanliness of medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of infection.
The primary health purpose of hand washing is to remove microorganisms (pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who work in the food industry or in the medical field, and it is important for all societies.
Hand washing has important benefits in reducing the incidence of influenza, coronavirus and other communicable diseases, preventing the spread of diarrheal infections and reducing the incidence of pneumonia.
And reduce the mortality rate of home births.
A 2013 study suggested that improved handwashing practices may lead to minor improvements in height and growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing healthy habits such as handwashing with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate from these diseases by about 50%.
A protective layer that increases the thickness of the hand can reduce diarrhea by about one third, and this can be compared to providing clean water to poor people.
48% of the reduction in diarrheal disease can be attributed to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is the most effective and easy way to prevent diarrheal disease and pneumonia infection as seen in schools, homes and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the most common type of ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, infecting about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet is a common practice that will save more lives than any vaccine or medication, cutting a woman's risk of diarrhea by almost half and death from respiratory failure by a quarter.
Hand washing is always combined with other water purification methods as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetigo (skin infection), which is transmitted by physical contact.
A minor problem with hand washing is that excessive hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study found that frequent hand washing can cause itching, a hand dislocation that is most common among healthcare workers.
Regular hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five times a day when handwashing with soap is essential to reduce the spread of infection through the face and mouth: after using the toilet (no toilet, no bathroom), after changing a child's diaper (change of diaper), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other times when proper hand washing is necessary to prevent the spread of infection include before or after surgery for a cut or wound; after touching a bone of a tick or handling an animal; and after touching dirt.
In many lands, handwashing with soap is rare.
A handwashing survey in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest state-level handwashing rate of 97% followed by the Near and Middle East with 77% followed by China with the lowest rate of 23%.Much of the climate change is increasing handwashing rates with soap at critical times.The practice of handwashing by schoolchildren during sunny times is one option in developing countries to make children's handwashing habits part of their habits.
""The Essential Health Program"" implemented by the Education Commission in the Philippines is an example of how to take action to improve children's health and education".
Twice a year, a reduction in the amount of water, which is helped by daily hand washing with soap, daily mouthwash with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing microscopic particles from the skin is more effective when soap or soap powder is added to water.
The original step of soaps and soap powders was to reduce the barrier to success and increase digestion.
Water alone is essential for cleansing the skin to make proteins, which are derived from the soil, insoluble in water.
Cleansing is done with the help of running water.
Water soap because it can be reused at any time, it can retain bacteria from previous uses.
A small study showed that transfer of bacteria from contaminated soap was completed by transferring bacteria not by bubbles.
The CDC has stated that new water and drainage systems for drainage are better.
Nations are warned against using disinfectant soaps.
To date, there is no evidence to support its use as an antibiotic or as a biological resistant.
However, antibacterial soaps contain antibiotic agents such as triclosan, which contains a large sequence of chemical compounds.
So even if immune cells are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they probably won't be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactant and skin protective agent, cosmetics may contain lactic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and skin conditioner (aleo vera, vitamin, menthol, plant extract) A summary study from the University of Oregon School of Dental Medicine found that soap is clearly a type of antibiotic soap laced with triclosan for protection against infection and to kill hand germs.
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands with is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria are most active at a temperature of 37 °C.
Although warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water is more effective at removing oil from the bottom, and even small particles are invisible to the naked eye.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using warm water does little to reduce the number of germs on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or antibacterial oil which is the original water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based and water-free hand sanitizers (also called alcohol-based hand sanitizers, medicated hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in an oil, or a hemectant such as glycerin in water, or a foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Increasing the volume of hydrogen-peroxide produced, to maintain the availability of products, hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% are the most effective at killing bacteria.
Hand ointment is a disinfectant, an anti-inflammatory, a multi-toxic antibacterial (MRSA and VRE) agent, a treatment for tuberculosis and other viruses (including HIV, zoonotic, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol hand sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (log 3.5, equivalent to 35 decbel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5 reduction) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are effective against bacterial bacteria and have a branch effect on viral bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers have no effect on norovirus infection, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis (heartburn).Antiseptic or alcohol should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of the hands and between the tips of all the fingers are brushed for about 30 seconds until the water, foam or cleaning solution dries.
Wash your fingers thoroughly, wiping the entire palm of your hand. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer, especially if hands are exposed to dirt.
further use of these agents depends on the ease of use and rapid killing actions on the bacteria however they should be used as a substitute for proper washing unless and when water or soap is not available.
Overuse of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or anti-drying chemicals are added to the mixture.
The effect of drying or removal of hand washing detergent can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or a hand emollient by hand.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused less itching and dryness than soap or antibiotic soap.
Allergic reactions to dermatitis, near-allergic urticaria or allergies to chemicals or to the presence of a solution in hand washing products do not occur.
The inability to cause complications associated with dermatitis has become a major attraction over hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, the anti-inflammatory agent does not clean hands, but it does contaminate them.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than hand washing with soap and water because it prevents the spread of many bacteria, since other infections are usually found on the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizer oil depends on its chemical composition and the source of the oil, and historically it has had little to do with ointment.
Recently, synthetic benzalkonium chloride formulations have been shown to have rich and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, decreasing efficacy after repeated use, possibly as a result of the development of severe skin discoloration.
Many in low-income countries cannot afford soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
A pot or a pot may be more useful than a pot of water, but it is no more useful than soap.
Another concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms invisible to the eye, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a soap agent because it can remove bacteria when combined with water to form alkali.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using ash or soil instead of soap if soap is not available.
The most effective handwashing practices by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of disease are as follows:
Rinse your hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because water in the valley can be contaminated while the temperature or humidity of the water will not change anything.
Apply a soap bubble to the hands by rubbing them thoroughly with soap, including the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Soap clears bacteria from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more often when they use soap instead of water.
Bake for at least 20 seconds.
Brushing creates a stronger grip, which helps remove bacteria from the skin, and a long brushing removes many bacteria.
bound in running water.
The hand may be tied in a bowl.
Drying with a clean towel and a little air in the bed makes it dry.
The most commonly found are the upper arm, the wrist, the interpalm, the interpalm, and the base of the thumb.
Fingers that are rubbed with nail polish can harbor germs.
It is recommended to use a face cream to prevent dry hands, dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of infection.
There are many simple ways to improve handwashing where tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging jar or a pitch-perforated basin or using a pot body with holes and/or ash should it need to be lifted in developing countries.Where there is insufficient water (such as schools or villages in developing countries), there are water conservation measures such as hanging jar and other simple methods.
Hand-and-foot water cannons are a simple technique that consists of a rope and a rope attached to a hose, and a footrest to pour a little water on the hands with a soap stick.
Drying hands properly is a way of hand hygiene but there is debate on the most effective way of drying in public toilets.
Studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than the electronic hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, conducted by European Tissue Symposium, compared the hygiene benefits of paper towels to the heating and air conditioning of hand dryers and hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a warm-air dryer, it was found that the total number of small, invisible particles increased in the forearm by at least 194% and the palm by 254%.
Drying with a gas dryer increased the average number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and in the palm by 15%.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacterial infections on the fingertips decreased by 76% and on the palms by 77%.Scientists also conducted tests to determine if there could be contamination between toilet users and the toilet environment due to any type of drying process.
The airbag, which blows air out of the unit at a speed of 180m/s (650km/h; 400mph), can dry out particulate matter from the hand and machine and can damage users and other washing machines and the environment outside the washing machine up to 2 meters high.
Using a dryer and heating air spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The test table showed no evidence of any microorganisms, or microorganisms, in the sample.In 2005, a study by TUV and the Environmental Protection Agency evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial counts after observing dry hands:
Many manufacturers of hand dryers exist, and hand dryers are often compared to paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer is an alternative when traveling when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The hand washing of medical procedures was forced by Hungarian scientist Ignaz semmelwais to prove its effectiveness in 1846 to prevent the spread of disease in the hospital yard.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a reduction in infection as well as benefits.
A medical hand washing procedure lasts at least 15 minutes, with the use of plenty of soap and water or oil to foam and rub on each side of the hand.
Hands are rubbed together, so that the fingers are not touched.
If there is debris under the fingertips, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water left on our hands, it is important to keep them tightly bound and to wipe them with a dry clean towel.
After drying, use a paper towel to cover the water (open any exit if possible).
This prevents the re-contamination of the hands and the surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (viruses) and prevent their spread.
A new medical journal reports that hand washing is not acceptable in many healthcare settings, with many doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, which causes the spread of germs.
Research shows that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a paper recommending proper hand washing and rubbing in health departments.
The guidelines for hand hygiene can be found on the official website.
Whitby et al. conducted a relevant review.
Commercial machines can measure hand hygiene, if a system is needed, approval is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five "Five Moments" of hand washing:
related to the first component of blood or body fluid.
Before aseptic operation, and
"after treatment of a patient. Adding a disinfectant to soap ("antibacterial" or ""antibacterial"" soap) increases the disinfection efficiency of hand sanitizer".
Such a kill may be desired before surgery or in the setup, in highly resistant cells, cutting hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or detergent, sterile towels for hand drying after washing, sterile brushes for cutting and other sterile tools for cleaning under the mattress.
Remove all jewelry.
This procedure requires washing hands for at least 2 to 6 minutes.
Long exposure time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing hands, do not allow water to pass in front of the hands and backwards.
After hand washing, the hands were dried with a cloth that was not a lens, and the washing machine was surgically removed.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is advisable to wash hands or use a protective soap before and after examining the patient.
For the treatment of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the maximum benefit of hand washing was 20% and the minimum additional benefit obtained from regular hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Regular soap washing results in more than three times the effect of bacterial disinfection on food compared to washing with disinfectant soap.Comparing hand-washing with disinfectant with hand washing with disinfectant soap for 30 minutes each showed that alcohol-based alcohol reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than disinfectant soap.
But soap and water are more effective than the alcohol-based soap used to reduce the H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium defficile spores from the hands, initiatives to improve hand hygiene in healthcare systems can increase awareness for workers on hand washing, and the availability of hand washing products for hand brushing and labeling and reminders for workers.
More research is needed, to identify which are most effective in different healthcare systems.
In developing lands, handwashing with soap is considered a simple, safe way to stay healthy, even a healthy diet.
Although the lack of safe drinking water, soap and hand washing products in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve global handwashing standards.
For example in most rural areas of Africa handwashing taps near government toilets are scarce, although there are cheaper options to build handwashing stations.
Although the lack of laundry facilities may be a result of culture rather than a lack of soap and water.
Providing advice on hand washing with soap can influence decision-making, increase awareness of the importance of hand washing and can change people's attitudes.
For this to work properly, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A review of 70 studies showed that public handwashing awareness was more effective in increasing trust in handwashing in LMICs, while public advertising campaigns were less effective.[citation needed] Another example of public handwashing awareness in schools is the UNICEF-backed Three Star Approach which encourages schools to take non-commercial measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, as well as other hygiene measures.
If the goal is achieved, schools can move to the final star category.
Building handwashing facilities can be a way of campaigning and promoting the reduction of childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of increased awareness that tries to change behavior.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
Few researchers have considered the impact of handwashing costs in developing countries, in a context where DALY is prohibited.
However, it is recommended that improved hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for personal health especially for people in critical situations such as women who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospital was first articulated in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Dr. Hugary Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the battery that "founded modern nursing".
At the time, many believed that the disease was caused by a smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, the spread of foodborne illness and the risk of infection from neglect of healthcare led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene in an effort to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 foot-and-mouth outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to a growing awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against such diseases.
For example, a billboard with information on effective handwashing practices has been posted near handwashing facilities in public toilets and free zones in factories and airports in Germany.
"The phrase ""washing the hands of another"" means to identify those who refuse to accept responsibility for something or who share in the suffering".
It originated from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but they became a common phrase in English.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins by insisting on washing her hands and clearing the stain from her mind, which reflects her guilty conscience over her crime and her husband's actions.
It has also been found that some people wash their hands more often, more often than others, after thinking about doing something illegal, and they place more importance on hand sanitizer than on other items.
In addition, those who were allowed to wash their hands after such ceremonies would perform a revenge cleansing service, such as a sacrifice.
Religious practices warn against hand washing for religious purposes, using water but not soap to wash hands, is a ritual hand washing in many religions, including Baha'iism, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavado in Christianity, and wundu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow for hand washing, but not using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam all require washing hands before and after meals.
Managing the risks of COVID-19 in the workplace
Workplace risk awareness from COVID-19 protects workplace and healthcare practices to monitor risk to protect people from COVID-19 coronavirus infection in 2019.
The specific risk assessment for workplace exposure depends on the workplace and workplace environment, based on an assessment of the risk associated with the location of the outbreak, the severity of the outbreak in the community, and the risk associated with workers who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the risk of exposure to exposure to low-level workplace contacts with the public and other co-workers is high with recommended infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory exposure, regular sanitation, and disinfection of workplace environments.
Workers at high risk include those who require isolation or contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be susceptible to infection due to ongoing community transmission or travel abroad.
This includes jobs that involve public relations, such as schools, crowded areas, and shopping malls.
Risk precautions for these groups, in addition to preventive measures, include, ventilation equipment that uses a microphone air filter, a respiratory mask and a respiratory aid in case of COVID-19 infection.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and domestic workers exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 person at high risk, which increases to a higher risk of exposure if workers follow aerosol spraying guidelines, or collect or handle products from, a known or suspected COVID-19 person.
Hazardous materials suitable for workers include mechanical equipment such as air-conditioning units, and workplace safety equipment suitable for the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can cause many problems in the workplace.
Employees may steal from work because of illness, to care for others, or to avoid contracting disease.
The business model can change, even in terms of what kind of goods are needed, and how the goods will be produced (such as buying goods at night or through a drive-through service).
Finally, and equipment deployed in continents where COVID-19 is most prevalent may be disrupted.Preparation for the disease that is spreading can be used in response systems in the early stages of prevention.
Good planning reduces the risks associated with workplaces and occupations, including where infections occur, the risks arising from home and community environments, and the risks to workers such as age or other serious health conditions.
They show the appropriate precautions for hazards, and the future actions for such behavior that may occur as a result of outbreaks.
Communicable disease planning and response planning may be the subject of national or subnational consultations.
The objectives of information-gathering when an outbreak occurs include reducing the spread of the disease among workers, protecting the health of people considered vulnerable, reforming the business system and reducing the burden on others who are on the system.
The disease affects a neighborhood where the trade is taking place.
Risk monitoring is a process used to either health- or occupational-level rank health to a group of critical risks.
Where the risk of COVID-19 cannot be excluded, the best precautions are the mechanical mask, followed by the management mask, and finally the protective equipment on the body.
Engineering automation is based on the isolation of workers from work-related hazards without relying on the behavior of workers, and would be the least expensive solution implemented.
The supervisory board changes the working conditions and the structure that would require the employee to take a break.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered to be a low-powered, but effective means of reducing infection.
All PPE must be selected before the risk to the worker, properly worn (e.g. respirator), worn regularly and properly, and checked regularly, replaced if caught and removed, washed, maintained properly to ensure that the speed of the breathing is maintained.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure to workplace hazards means less interaction between the employee and the public and other employees.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include regular hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are ill, providing ventilation with a roof and a cough and runny nose, providing a safe storage of paper and litter, preparing work from home or turning over trash if necessary, preventing employees from using tools and equipment of others, and maintaining hygiene to reduce contamination and damage to the work environment.
Rapid detection and isolation of infected persons is the most effective way to protect the health of workers, customers, visitors and those in their workplaces.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of asthma stay at home until they recover, if the symptoms of fever last for more than 24 hours and the battery is dead or the symptoms are not treated and the sick leave is valid, the employee should stay home and treat the patient as they know the plan.
In OSHA's definition, high-risk occupations include those requiring warmth or contact within six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19 individuals, but who may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission in business premises, or because someone has traveled abroad to an area where a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred.
These include workplaces that have interaction with the general public such as in schools, workplaces with high-risk work environments where there is a high population density, and places where shopping is common. Engineering design for this and risky workgroups includes the installation of improved ventilation, increased number of ventilation units, installation of physical barriers such as rubber air-conditioning systems, and installation of drive-through windows for customer service. The manager's recommendations for this and more risky workgroups include encouraging unhealthy employees to stay at home, changing the combination of face-to-face and remote access, initiating work rotations, avoiding travel and personal contact where there is no COVID-19 outbreak, and developing a coordinated emergency response system that can provide employees with adequate hands-on, face-to-face, face-to-face, training, training, and other workplace safety measures to prevent or reduce the risk of COVID-19.
A worker who is part of a risky fishing team needs to use a ventilator.
If someone becomes ill on board an aircraft, appropriate measures to protect the crew and other passengers include isolating the patient from others within 6 feet of each other, assigning one of the flight crew to isolate the patient, and providing a mask to the patient or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Seafarers should wear medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or contact with bodily fluids or possible environmental contamination, and possibly additional protective equipment if a sick passenger has a fever, a persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items in a germ bag, face covering containing contaminated items should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial transport, including cruise and other passenger flights, risk management includes delaying travel when sick, self-isolation and informing the health care center immediately if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while traveling.
The CDC recommends that schools and childcare facilities be closed to allow for cleanup of the area and to monitor the spread of the virus in the community.
If there is a small spread of the disease in the community, there should be a curfew such as traffic restrictions, meetings, even large gatherings such as a chalet or choir class, or a dining room, move tables, and departure times, reduce visitors who are not essential, and isolate a section of the language that has flu symptoms.
When there is a local community spread of the disease, in addition to social distancing, long school breaks may be factored in.For family workers and those with regular jobs, the risk of infection is lower, the CDC says.
Law enforcement officers who must be in contact with people who have been diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow emergency procedures of medical personnel, with appropriate protective equipment.
if contact is made during the emergency, workers should wipe and clean their equipment before re-working using a household sprayer or wiper, and follow the instructions for use to reach and dispose of PPE used to wash their equipment.
OSHA is considering the possibility of a healthcare and mortuary staff to sit upright because of the risk of infection.
The occupational risks of people with human exposure are encountered by healthcare workers, support, laboratory and transportation personnel who are exposed to an infected or suspected COVID-19 patient.
They are at increased risk if workers follow aerosol-generating spraying, or test-response, from a suspected COVID-19 agent.
Aerosol generating pocedures include induction, cough, and lung involvement.
The most at-risk morgue work includes workers who process cadavers of people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these are particularly at-risk when testing the cadaver.More engineering work in these high-risk groups includes quarantining infected or suspected COVID-19 patients during aerosol-generating procedures.
Special ventilation systems may be installed in some healthcare facilities, including storage rooms.
All samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new cases be isolated in different locations from family members or other people who have been infected with COVID-19.In addition to some PPE, OSHA recommends the use of ventilation equipment for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected patients with SARS-COV-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH has approved N95 for filtering or even proper use of respirators, a safety measure that includes rigorous testing, studies and clinical trials.
Some air conditioners can provide good protection and improve worker well-being.WHO does not recommend the use of a respirator, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is spread through body fluids.
WHO has recommended that medical masks are appropriate for point-of-entry inspection personnel.
For those receiving respiratory samples from, monitoring, or handling a COVID-19 infected person without an aerosol-generating procedure, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, a high-quality glove, and gloves.
If the aerosol-generating principle is followed, it will replace the use of N95 medical masks or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommended reducing the need for PPE by providing medical supplies via contact, physical barriers such as an open mask, allowing those involved in care to directly access a room where a COVID-19 patient is, using PPE only for specific work, continuing to use a conventional ventilator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same illness, monitoring and balancing the supply of PPE, and restricting the use of masks for people with symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Reducing waste and planning for the future
The following is a list of all known from the series The Outsiders:
Copyright: CC0: No rights reserved This is a copyrighted work.
We found ourselves in a very special situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a manifestation of our global relationships and the burden it hangs on each of us.
We are not biased for a challenge, but we hate that our response depends on the compassion, cooperation and community building that sits at the heart of the Organization.
The co-operation and care we have seen in all our colleagues over e-mail, phone calls, and chat is another proof of the confidence of the people we are so fortunate to work with.
I will not fail in my efforts to make you one of my colleagues.
Last week, someone shared his appreciation for our work
They reminded me that the world could change Wikipedia now, which is a drug test champion and open to everyone online.
Your efforts make this possible, whether you keep the sites down or our partners pay or from our community reserves.
The world needs the information you provide on Wikipedia, more than ever.
It is a time when, not what we do but how we do it, will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the benefits of this and your role we will make a few changes to our schedule starting next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn said, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the coming days and months.
In this regard, we have considered what we feel is the best answer to our situation and the best way to keep the organization in proper order during that time.
We want to avoid stress and support our long-term goals.
If you want to call more, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and employees
Our work schedule for any given day will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't give you a break - if you can work hard in normal hours, the organization can work for you.
However, the world cannot be predicted right now, and should you be watching your beloved, buying a grocery, or going to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't follow your timeline
If you are sick, do not work
This has gone unspoken, but we speak of it.
No sick days or need to tell your PTO manager with the help of resetting your team calendar and schedule to ensure important work.
(If you have been tested positive for COVID-19, Bryan's grave in T&amp;C Ops knows that T&amp;C will help ensure that the case receives proper treatment.)
The entire Community will be paid.
We have already said, and we respect all our commitments to deliver our contracts with our employees as well as our employees.
Each person would be paid according to the amount of the hours worked and would be paid accordingly.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you will work, we will support you.
Many people view work as a way to convey their problems to the world around us.
Especially in such situations can our efforts be truly rewarding.
The same is true of personal care
Our job is to talk to your manager, to find out what we need and how we can accommodate.
Some activities are necessary.
There are other things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Reliability and Integrity, and Fundraising Teams (among others) are doing critical work that requires additional support.
We will begin the entire process of identifying the current objectives and focus on supporting what is important in our work.
There is much work ahead of us, but we will focus on the important ones.
A decrease now will not hurt in the future.
We have no plans to travel twice-a-week to achieve our goals once the pandemic is over.
You will not be required to work overtime because it is now impossible to finish the job on time.
We accept changing circumstances, and we will work to create new plans as time goes on.
What happened to APP (Annual Plan)?
To adapt to the current situation and to our daily activities, we are considering changing the timing to meet our 2020-2021 schedule.
Our aim is to extend our 2019-2020 schedule which will allow for more budgetary time to allow employees to focus on essential tasks, self-care, and caring for loved ones while leaving those who need or want to work on reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
This additional time further reduces the workload and pressure on the entire organization.
We will be moving our plan to our interlocutors next week with new officials and teams on our next plan to confirm.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office space, safe, and clean
Last week we learned that one of the SF-BASED staff was infected with COVID-19.
However, in the midst of much maintenance, we had a team of disinfectors clean the entire yard at our San Francisco office.
I have to wipe or disinfect the area to prevent the spread of disease, including roads and the underground.
The building is getting a new level of systematic monitoring and control to ensure the health of its people.
We are happy to know that the branch office will be ready anytime we are ready to return.
Our DC office at WeWork, which has made COVID-19 policy a concern for any DC-BASED employee
Last week, our DC office became a full-fledged location with security information from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues who live in NYC know, we are in talks about donating a Brooklyn location.
The discussions continue, but he is slow.
Some of our employees are working remotely for the first time.
Our remote work friends know that it can be a balancing act, and they are willing to offer suggestions.
Limit the conversation to an hour or two at a time.
If more time is needed, think about how to distribute them over the next several days.
Plan ahead, find out the purpose of the meeting, and send the study aids.
Make videos real, and tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate meeting and communicating directly over the internet.
Have a guide to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor discussions for questions and follow up on the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or co-take-notes).
Send an email to tech support if you need a handheld headset that is comfortable.
Use your health-promoting products as a snack.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to chat with colleagues about work sharing.
HR Services is seeking guidance in building a core ergonomics framework to support increased work sharing across the Foundation.
We asked the entire community last week to allow the Wikimedia Foundation to drop funding for the community, such as editathons, until WHO says the pandemic is over.
We announced that we understand our demands to lift some restrictions would make it difficult to finalize their funding agreements and that no one would be penalized for delaying or modifying the policy.
We will be reviewing further guidelines next week on Wikimedia and other community and forum platforms as usual.
The overall perception of the world community portrays the session as depressing and disruptive but it is again a meeting of minds and a focus on the community, Wikimedia and otherwise.
In the future, CRT is working on creating a META-WIKI page to provide a platform for the community to observe and track all our content.
Stay on top of everything related to COVID-19
We will send you a calendar invitation next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting for our staff.
We can use this time to share more updates, answer questions, and spend a little time with one another.
We are all in this together and are here to help in any way we can.
For now, you can find my information via this email, as well as a link to similar COVID-19 information on the Office Wiki,
CRT on the storage pages is well and all the information is in one place.
We work to maintain contact with workers who live in the countries currently affected.
If you have any questions about travel, or any other concerns, or any other work, or filling a vacancy or anything else then you need help don't hesitate to contact us and give CRT support.
We are there to help and support if needed.
If you have something important or a matter that needs attention, please send an email to Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
These changes should not be viewed as a complete and total withdrawal.
Rather, they realize that at this time, our work and assignments may need to be adjusted in a way that we have not done before.
These are steps we feel are necessary to support one another so that we can keep up the work, provide our organization with the necessary support, and have the work the world relies on.
Our work schedule is there and waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to take care of one another and to make room for the vital work ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need your support to make this possible, so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that we can be there for you if the need arises.
Now, please - wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, she is CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), along with other directors (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the cell membranes of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 modulates the activity of the enzyme associated with the coagulation (ACE) by reducing the angiotensin-II receptor and increasing Ang (1-7) levels making it a key target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry pathway for some coronaviruses.
A type of human enzyme called hACE2.
The active enzyme of Angiotensin 2 is zinc-containing ironloenzyme which is present on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ACE2 protein is composed of a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transport domain.
ACE2 is a type of membrane-bound protein, with an enzymatically active region that expands the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular region of ACE2 is broken off from the viral region by an enzyme known as hemolytic acid, and the resulting digestive protein is excreted into the bloodstream and eventually into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to the skin of most alveolar cell types II, small intestinal enterocytes, coronary artery and heart muscle cells and soft tissue cells in many organs.
ACE2 MRNA residues can be found in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus straitum and briainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a stabilizing agent for ACE.
ACE is reduced by the angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also clear other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup syndrome.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry point into the cell (cell) for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
The mutations appear to be a combination of the spike protein s1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 do bind the patient to ACE2 in the cell wall which in turn causes endocytosis and translocation of the disease by the cell wall into the endosome which is the cell wall.
The tar receptor with all the S protein priming principles is derived from the serine protease TMPRSS2, the precursor to the currently studied major therapeutic agent. This leads to a decrease in the level of ACE2, in cells, which may help fight the disease.
However, the majority of the population of the study required further ACE inhibitor therapy.
A review published on July 11, 2012 found ACE inhibitors were associated with a 34% reduction in colds compared to the average.
The risk of cold is highest in patients who are given ACE inhibitors for the risk of seizures, death or heart attack.
Use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with reduced pneumonia mortality, although the results obtained were insignificant beyond the risk of pneumonia.
Recombination human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a treatment for severe pneumonia, manifested by improved pulmonary function and oxygenation in the small intestine and triggered lipopolysaccharide syndrome leading to severe respiratory fatigue symptoms.
The half-life of RHACE2 in humans is 10 hours and 30 seconds of activity including 24 hours of additional activity.
Several studies have suggested that rhACE2 may be a potential drug for intolerance to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where anglotensin II concentration is elevated.
"b'COVID-19 are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (""contacts"") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
seeking and obtaining access to government funding in certain areas and settlements.
A number of methods to identify the person involved have been disclosed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding the system related to tracking the locations of countries using the software.
A small KAFAR uses air to enter the cell phone hacking camp.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would merge services to support such Bluetooth-enabled apps directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the country's government, in partnership with Alipay, deployed a mobile application that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19 infection.
It is used in over 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The software was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be made available to the government.North Macedonia has launched ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth-based software to detect the threat from people infected with the virus and respond to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is awaiting approval from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced the launch of the new internal surveillance app, Design for the Future, which is due to be released in the same week as the app, known in Ireland as Call for Action and in France as Stop Covid.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia plans to introduce a major version of the tool for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed some potential problems with implementing cyber application plans, including fake scams and potential ineffectiveness if adoption of the tool would be limited to a small community.
Addressing concerns about the spread of the spread or harm of the coronavirus app, Apple has set limits on the types of devices that organizations can place with a coronavirus-related content in the app store, limiting them to companies or other popular organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the impact of social surveillance using coronavirus tools, particularly about whether surveillance tools developed to combat the Coronavirus pandemic will be abandoned once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other human rights organizations have issued a statement calling for a reduction in this type of surveillance.
The organizations identified eight areas of government activity:
Supervision activities must be "legal", "necessary", and "proportionate".
open or care of the baby may have evening.
the use of data is strictly necessary for COVID-19 reasons;
Confidential information and transactions must be kept confidential and shown to be protected for reasons;
Digital patient monitoring must avoid bias and isolation.
any exchange of information with others must be regulated by law;
There is a protection against abuse and a right of citizens to respond to abuse;
A meaningful participation of all classmates is required, several health professionals and organisations including the German Cancer Society CCC and Reporter ohne Grenzen RSF have also released the names of the reviewers.
The proposed Google/Apple system aims to address the problem of continuous tracking by removing tracking from the operating system of their device as long as it is not needed.
some countries have used location tracking instead of apps that take advantage of the download and protect location tracking.
In Israel, it is accepted to explore communication channels.
Network solutions that have access to location resource data are critical to address privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to a private data center; many private data centers have been created that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app tracking system is used to identify the mother.
Instead of using a standalone app, the system collects tracking data from multiple sources including phone records and card transaction data, and combines these to generate notifications via text messages to infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert contacts, the government also made location information public, something that was allowed due to extensive changes to privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made publicly available through various applications and websites. Accounts including Germany are used using a purity and confidentiality system.
As of 6 April 2020, no information has been released.
Privacy of identification contact information is a well-established process, with a well-established body of research that dates back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen experts are working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to track user proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative effort that includes both centralized and flexible methods, not a single protocol. The proposed standards include the Privacy Shield for Identity (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Time-based Local Numbers (TCN, fka combination numbering scheme, CEN), Privacy and Procedures Framework for Mobile Communications Inspection (PACT) and others.
In this system, the data is not left on the machine but all the data on the machine is stored.
MIT's privacy initiatives are developing methods that are more secure by considering privacy in the tracking and also using the location or location of the isolated data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is related to the research of the Apps gone rogue privacy white paper by Mussaman on the prevention of the pandemic released in March 2020 in a similar effort by the early morning trace of enigma mpc, a software development company that developed the MIT Labs database.
Morning Trace uses science to leave users with a compelling visual representation of health and worker data without compromising their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, global TCN groups formed a consortium based on what is essentially a common approach and a commonly accepted protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling continued global interaction through the identification and alerting of app stores, a key part of achieving the goal of the pandemic.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the opening of a database of cause-linked infections through its national governmental app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that operate the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a discovery plan, which they said would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy policies.
They also published a detailed scientific methodology for the foot.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to roll out in three phases:
to develop tools to allow the government to create a mass media presence and prevent people from joining.
integrate these automated operating systems into iOS and Android Google and Apple programs to address maintenance and development issues by distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it from the system once the threat has passed.
Drug re-evaluation also known as drug re-search, drug re-evaluation, drug re-processing, or drug re-treatment is the process of approving a drug to treat a variety of diseases or a drug regimen that has not been previously developed.
This is a one-line technology study that was initiated to find an effective vaccine for covid-19.
Other research options include the development of COVID-19 antibody vaccines and convalescent plasma vaccines.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic proteins, each with ligand-gated sites.

The COVID-19 vaccine is the vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are several attempts in progress to develop such a treatment.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the availability of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be less than 18 months away.
The five vaccines are in Phase I clinical trial in April.
Covid-19 was first identified in December 2019.
The global pandemic in 2020 has led to increased investment restrictions in RESEARCH.
Several organizations are using genomic genomics to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Launched in April, CEPI's critical initiative to develop vaccines early, mass-market, mass-disseminate, and make them available worldwide.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technologies were under research and development in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Many circles have placed the emphasis of stage I development on immunoassays such as;
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I enhancer and immunoassay: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Stage I of development and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
A report by the experts in April, 115 drugs were initially tested and 78 were confirmed in progress 79 according to the 37-member academy, but no information was available to the public and they are thought to be in the process of being developed or prepared in several laboratories.
In the I-II phases of the primary conservation test and shield test, the combined non-selective and non-collinear and external multiplexing are used, which allows for a more accurate evaluation.
Phase III trials typically involve additional participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring for better adverse outcome outcomes.

A clinical trial in Australia requires the involvement of 4,170 healthcare workers
It is possible that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to determine the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19 specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, as well as other laboratory animals and non-human primates, have highlighted the need for biosafety-level 3 measures of the containment of live pathogens, and global standards for ensuring a safe system.
Vaccines for SARS and MERS have been developed in human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be effective and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of vaccines and drugs to treat SARS remain a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS became more common, it was believed that the available SARS test could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there are vaccines (based on DNA) against MERS that have completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in development, all of which are viral vector-borne vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
The social media posts promoted a broad-based theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and a vaccine is already available.
The citations published by various social media outlets cite available information about the genetic sequence and vaccination of certain coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
b'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The usual symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, bad breath, and fever.
The period from infection to onset of symptoms is about five days but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multiple immune deficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, there have been more than two million (2.24) new cases from 210 countries resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered from the disease, which is spread by close contact, usually by small droplets of saliva passed through cough, sneeze, or mouth.
As the spores emerge during respiration, most of them fall to the ground or surface rather than being a highly contagious disease from a distance.
People can get the disease by touching contaminated surfaces and then by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The bacteria can survive on surfaces for 72 hours.
It is most common in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it can spread before symptoms appear later.The primary method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
It is recommended that those suspected of having the disease, along with their caregivers, wear masks.
Recommendations for the use of face masks and masks in public are varied, with some authorities recommending avoiding their use, some recommending their use, others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Domestic outbreaks have been recorded in most countries around the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may become symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and respiratory failure.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty standing, and swelling of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are observed.
Sometimes, respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, runny nose or dry throat appear.
Gastrointestinal infections such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in various organs.
Some cases of heart attack and hypertension have been reported in China.
In some, the disease can progress to limonia, paralysis and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is five to six days but can last two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within eleven and a half days of infection.Rohoto indicates that not all infected people show symptoms of infection.
The role of these unresponsive carriers in transmission is not yet known; however, some witnesses have indicated that they may be capable of transmitting the disease.
The estimated proportion of people who do not show symptoms of the infection is currently unknown, but is under investigation.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people do not show symptoms during their hospital stays.
The Chinese health authorities began including symptomatic patients in the daily cases on 1 April; of their 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) were symptomatic patients at the time of testing.
All modern-day vaccines can carry a wide range of viruses.
Speaking aloud allows for a greater degree of expression than speaking in a normal way.
A study in Singapore revealed that coughing can cause a person to fall 15 feet (4.5 m) off the ground.
Although the virus does not transmit via airborne contamination, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission can occur if air collectors are placed on an outdoor surface, near a human environment where contaminated RNA samples are found.
Some medical procedures such as c-section and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause air pollution that can cause respiratory infection.
While there is concern that it can be spread through the toilet, this risk is thought to be relatively low.The virus is more likely to spread as people become infected, while transmission is likely before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) says that while it is not fully understood how easily the disease spreads, one person infects two to three.The virus can survive for hours to days on a surface.
In particular, the virus has been detected for up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and metal (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to the temperature.
Soap is helpful when used correctly; the soap product will fight off the infection and remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, were not effective.In a Hong Kong study, oral swabs were taken for two days after initial hospital care.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest incidence of the disease, and then the sixth patient showed the highest incidence of the disease on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome second coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious coronavirus, initially isolated three cases of cluster-related pneumonia and respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 occur in the atmosphere.
Outside the human body, the local soap virus is killed which breaks down its immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is the most similar to the SARS-CoV strain.
The lungs are most affected by COVID-19 because the virus is able to enter cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzymes, which are most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a peplomer to bind to ACE2 to enter the host cell.
Heart failure was diagnosed in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe cases.
The incidence of heart attack symptoms is particularly high, due to inflammatory processes and immune system problems as the disease progresses, but a known heart attack is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and accelerate the function of the heart.
A severe risk of bone thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with progression.All people who died from COVID-19 had a degenerative discontinuity (DAD), a lymphocyte-like inflammation that enters the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a mutation in ACE2-expressing cells of the respiratory tract, patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of severe inflammation.
In a nutshell, it has been shown that GM-CSF-secreting T-cells are associated with inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and the development of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic cells were found in the remains.
The WHO has published several diagnostic strategies for the disease.
The standard test method is the direct-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on a sample of the respiratory tract obtained from a nasopharyngeal test, however, a sample taken from the nose and throat may be used.
Test results are available within two hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are not immediately significant.
Chinese scientists have isolated a new strain of coronavirus and the discovery of a new genetic sequence that laboratories around the world can use to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection.
As of 4 April 2020, immunoassay tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person has previously been infected) are under development, but are still not widely used.
According to Chinese understanding of testing, the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the US approved the first-line treatment on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.The diagnostic guide from the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommends diagnostic methods based on clinical characteristics and risk of the virus.
Multilubar junctions, opaque ground glass with area asymmetry and forward distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural inhibition, cracking, and stiffness may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little information on COVID-19.
The main findings from the excavations of the tombs are:
Macroscopy: plerosis, pericarditis, pulmonary failure and pulmonary edema.
Four types of pneumonia can be identified:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial and lymphocytic inflammation and the occurrence of large multinucleated cells.
acute pneumonia: alveolar atrophy (ADD) and alveolar exudate atrophy.
DAD is caused by severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing and pneumonia: groups of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic response
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with toilet paper when coughing or sneezing and recommends using a wristband if toilet paper is not available.
Hand hygiene after each cough or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public places, in part to limit transmission from symptomatic to symptomatic.The social distancing policy aims to reduce contact with an infected person and large crowds by closing schools and workplaces and restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distance rules require people to give a minimum of 6 feet (1.8 m) of distance.
"There is no known effective treatment to prevent COVID-19.Like vaccines, which are not expected to be available until early 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic's peak incidence, known as ""flattening the curve"".
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or having dirty hands in public, before eating or after snoring, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using hand sanitizer with at least 60% disinfectant, but only when soap and water are not available, and areas where hand sanitizer use is limited.
In these processes, the inhibitory effect of the microscopic eye is caused by alcohol compounds, such as ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacteria from alcohol; it is not suitable for hand sanitizer.
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
Patients are treated with supportive care, which may include fluid, a respirator and support for other affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to help patients with heart failure due to respiratory failure, but its effectiveness has not been proven.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to strengthen the immune system.
Supportive care is useful in those with mild early onset of infection WHO and the Chinese National Health Administration have published guidelines for the hospitalisation and care of COVID-19 infected patients.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have developed procedures from a number of organizations, including the IBCC.
As of April 2020 there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the sake of clarity, some medical professionals recommend starting with paracetamol over ibuprofen.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the spread of the virus, especially in healthcare settings where aerosol-producing activities such as hand ventilators are considered.
Healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR, i.e. an isolated room with monitoring, contact monitoring and ventilation monitoring.The CDC has defined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the period of exposure.
Recommended personal protective equipment is: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and gloves. When available, respirator (instead of face mask) is preferred.
N95 respirators are permitted for industrial use but the FDA has authorized face masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect objects from airborne pollutants such as dust but are effective against a specific agent of Nature that has no credit for taking medication without a doctor's prescription.
When there are no restrictions, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or home-made masks.
The COVID-19 strain is not severe enough to require ventilation or vice versa, but sometimes it is.
A form of respiratory support for COVID-19 infected individuals with respiratory distress for hospitalized individuals is being studied, with some evidence suggesting that inhalation can be prevented with nasal hypertension or pneumonia.
It is not known whether either of these two may provide the same benefit to people suffering from chronic illness.
Some doctors prefer invasive ventilation systems for the treatment of acne because the system slows the spread of aerosol substances, compared to nasal cannula passages. Severe cases are more common in older people (those over 60 years of age, older people over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds or other facilities, which limits the health system's ability to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases that require a full hospital bed.
A study in China found that five percent (5%) were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are admitted to the ICU.
Airway pressure becomes more complicated as respiratory insufficiency syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Pressure-regulated ventilators and PEEP are needed to increase ventilation volume, while reducing the risk of respiratory infections and pneumothorax.
Long PEEP is not available in an older air conditioner.
Research on therapeutic options began in January 2020, and drug trials are underway to combat a number of diseases.
Remdesivir appears to be the most complete.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be developed, most of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in ongoing trials.
Antibiotics may be tried on people who are very sick.
WHO advises volunteers to participate in effective, effective and safe treatment options.The FDA has granted provisional approval for convalescent plasma as a single life-threatening human trial.
The clinical studies needed to prove that it is safe and effective for the disease have not yet been done.
In February 2020 china launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The software identifies potential nearby contacts and uses surveillance data, thus increasing the risk of infection.
Each user can view up to three user profiles.
If a potential risk is detected, not only is self-isolation advised by the app, it can also alert local health officials.Big data analysis on phone data, facial recognition technology, phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to identify infected people, and people who have come into contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020 the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine to protect those who have come into contact with the infected person.
And in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone and data locations with the federal government's Gemany agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to explore ways to combat the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
Italian health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said mobile phone users informed him that 40 percent of people were getting high.
The German government organized a 48-week holiday program with over 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid also called on the world to find solutions, against the spread of the Corona virus.
People may face problems because of quarantine, travel restrictions, medical problems, or fear of contracting the disease itself.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increased social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, fatigue and economic collapse are all a perfect storm that will affect people's mental health and the health of society"."
The disease can be transmitted in a simple way with few or no symptoms, similar to lymphoma, a form of the common cold.
Mild symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, while those with known symptoms may take three to six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are limited.In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In those most affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to severe respiratory syndrome syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, uncontrolled blood clots and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Blood clotting problems, especially increased clotting time.It was reported that in six (6%) of those hospitalized with COVID-19, kidney problems accounted for four (4%) of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (Transaminases).
According to one report, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients who are transferred to the ICU have a seven-day interval between admission to hospital and death.
In the early case studies, the median time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Service of China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological analysis of the lung samples of the victim showed damage to the alveoli and fibromyxoid cells that originated from both lungs.
The virus has also been observed to alter the pneumocyte.
Pneumonia is similar to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the national health agency, cardiac damage was observed by elevated troponin levels or heartbeat.
According to March data from the US, 89% of those hospitalized have this condition.The availability of medical resources and regional economic conditions can also affect mortality.
Estimates of female mortality from this condition vary due to regional differences and administrative complexity.
Failure to count new infections can lead to a high death toll and could be exaggerated.
However, the fact of the matter is that the effects of past illness may indicate a specific underestimation of current mortality rates.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death compared to nonsmokers, with concerns about long-term sequelae of the disease being raised.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some recovered patients, and lung tests showed a decrease in human body size.
This can cause a problem after the treatment.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether those infected had recovered, or had long-term immunity.
A shell has been spotted, based on the characteristics of other coronaviruses, but there are cases of infected individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and were released for coronavirus tests the next time they were reported.
These concerns are seen as exacerbating the spread of infection rather than reinfecting it.
The virus is thought to be natural and to have animal origin, through infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the prevalence of infection was almost equal to human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed that the first day of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The World Health Organization announced that the first symptoms of the disease appeared on December 8, 2019.
Many procedures are used to ease the death of a woman
These figures vary by region and are influenced by the size of the trial over time, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time since the outbreak and demographic factors such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO designated the ICD-10 emergency number U07.1 for deaths from laboratory exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 deaths not excluding laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics the global mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2, 240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The numbers vary by region, other measures include the CFR (Census of Fertility) which shows the number of people (tested and untested) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are short-term and follow a specific population from which infection is cured by the disease.
Although not all people have immune systems, the presence of these chemicals may provide an explanation for how many people become infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Genglet, the virus is most prevalent during the Carnival season, and transmission to young people is the easiest cause of death and not all cases of COVID-19 are classified as such.
The German health system was not affected either.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent have antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from the COVID-19 virus.
The impact of disease and the death rate are different for men and women.
A study in China and Italy found that men were more likely to die than women
The greatest risk of infection in men is those aged 50 and over, with a male-female difference of only about 90 years.
In China the male mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
It is not known why there are no differences between men and women but drugs and sexual substances may be a factor.
The differences in immunity between men and women, the lower incidence of smoking among women and the earlier incidence of high blood pressure among men increased the mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of the cases were male, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government does not distinguish between male and female COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that the incidence of infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS varies between men and women.
The majority of health workers, namely nurses, are women, and they have a high risk of contracting the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be ""COVID-19""".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the disease was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid the idea of a geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or people, as opposed to a naming system that seeks to exclude and discriminate.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization uses the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "virus that causes COVID-19" in social networks.
Both the disease and the virus are referred to as the corona virus
During the first outbreak in Wuhan China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV, commonly known as respiratory infections as the temporary names for the virus and influenza based on 2015 guidelines on the use of facilities in viruses and infectious diseases.
COVID-19 was given the name SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020.
Due to limited capacity in the rich format, some digital manufacturers print medical devices such as nasal swabs and ventilation units.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed an air conditioner urgently, and we were not able to get one in time, the local inverter was able to produce the 100 valves needed that night.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false stories emerged on the origin, scale, prevention and other aspects of the virus that spread early online.
Humans can transmit the disease to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus in pigs, goats and chickens.
There is no approved cure or vaccine for the disease.
International research on COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic and industry research organizations.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY Trial to find four vaccines that are expected to be effective.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are working to find one.
Background work is being used on SARS-CoV because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 to enter the human body.
There are three ways to find out.
Initially, researchers aim to develop a vaccine against the virus.
Using such a virus, whether harmless or dead, seeks to establish an emergency immune response in the body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second, the vaccine, is a research project that seeks to develop a vaccine that will help to eliminate certain forms of the disease.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on the S-Spike enzyme that helps the virus to interfere in the growth of ACE2 enzymes.
The third technique is nucleic acid antibiotics (DNA or RNA antibiotics, new methods of developing antibiotics).
Vaccines from each must be tested for safety and efficacy by March 16, 2020, the company's first round of vaccines with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-infectious gene code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Chemical-mediated immunization has been proposed as a way to develop SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but there is controversy.
There were over 300 patients undergoing clinical trials as of April 2020.
Seven clinical trials are already evaluating the safety of the treatment of influenza, including four studies on hydrochloricquine and chloroquine.
Chinese research includes vaccines, and there were nine phases of trials on remdesivir in several countries due to the outbreak in late April.
A comprehensive review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and experimental therapies is underway. as of April 2020. A number of antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, looinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritomavir and inyerferon beta.
There is evidence of efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Symptoms of relief have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine A is used there for the treatment of malaria, and studies were conducted in China in 2020 to detect and detect the first week.
However, there is a plea to verify this finding.
The health authorities of Korea and China have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan University of Epidemiology, recommends a dose of one gram per day, as the use of two is extremely risky and can cause loss.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency report authorizing the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Recent research suggests that high doses of ribavirin are important in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
The use of Nitazoxanide was recommended for further study after demonstrating poor resistance to SARS-CoV-2.The study showed that early spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through binding to the ACE2 receptor.
Cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with co-administered azithromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community from accepting these treatments without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not enter the SARS-CoV-2 test vial and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine cycles can be a problem if the COVID-19 infection is severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has cytokine storm activity.China has included tociizumab in the clinical guidelines after a small study.
It is in a phase 2 trial that is not from anywhere in Italy after showing results in severely ill people.
Along with serum ferritin blood tests to detect cytokine storms, its role is to stop certain complications that are thought to be fatal in some people with the disease.
The FDA approved the addition of an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a reverse-mode study to treat the effects of steroid refractory cytokine release signaling induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized evidence that tocilizumab can treat CRS.
Transfer of disinfectant and collection of antibodies obtained through the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 infection to test subjects as a non-invasive method.
This system has been tried for SARS with insufficient results.
Viral immunosuppression is a process that increases the immune system's ability to combine protection against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms may also be available such as cell cytotoxicity and phagocytosis.
Other forms of immune system enhancement, for example, use monoclonal antibodies that are activated.
the production of convalescent serum, which consists of a fluidized blood sample obtained from patients and contains antibodies from the virus, may be added for immediate use.
The coronavirus is a group of diseases with a combination of symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became infected and died of COVID-19 after announcing the outbreak.
