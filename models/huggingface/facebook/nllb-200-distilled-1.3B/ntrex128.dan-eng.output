Welsh politicians afraid of "looking like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly at a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was created as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could cause ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means fool and pwp means shit.
A member of Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a brief verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (stupid).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on the appointments that Members of Parliament will have is of course up to the Members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was the one most supported in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the Assembly's president, Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of MPs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs will have the final say on what they are to be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory and has long protested Macedonia's bid to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the vote and says he will abstain.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is merely a price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's will be silent while the churches of Harlem will fight.
"The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there are none of the parts".
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in different ways these days", he said.
"Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood, where people go on a daily basis".
He worries that the money raised from selling assets is short-lived and that churches "are going back to where they started sooner or later".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's frequenters.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he says, "and that further fuels the trend of these churches eventually closing down altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis  Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930's.
A black congregation that had been operating nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, that would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the clock in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has unfolded at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some of whom have been brought in by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council  the parish's leading body of leading lay people  wrote in July to the diocese with concerns that the diocese "would try to push the expenses further" for the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent in by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, officials say.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement about catching a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his crab bones were torn up", said Hammel, as he saw as he approached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is listed in critical condition.
It's not clear what kind of shark attacked.
Life-saver Larry Giles told a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with lines of beauty products with dedicated assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to take over the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8bn and continues to grow while fashion and home goods are falling, the larger lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country and will be launched in more stores next year if they prove successful.
Investment in beauty products is being made as supermarkets look for new products for shelves formerly used for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's says it's doubling its range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space with branded areas similar to those seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique make-up range, so that most products are suitable for vegans  something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the perfume store Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon in south London last week and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small quantities of food daily from local shopkeepers mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract people to them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will become like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more nonfood services and goods.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since buying both chains two years ago.
The supermarket's previous attempts to update its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 00's, but the partnership ended in a dispute over how to distribute the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy chain to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty line to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to advise.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the inviting environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home products and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning host, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she's leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a rage after she withdrew from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the popular TV personality during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said her new deals  worth up to £1.5 million  meant she no longer had enough time for their home products and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
A source told the paper: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term project that she would be working on for the next few decades.
Her decision to step down surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There's a stockpile of goods at headquarters in Marlow that's already ready for sale".
Experts estimate that the departure of the This Morning host, one of Britain's highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions because of heavy investment in products  ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products  and the potential for further delays.
And it could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her landlord, Dan Baldwin, have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the stock in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to be the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business practices".
"We had a hard time talking, and then we fell in love".
He mocked the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that was "not worthy of a president" and for being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
said Trump in his parody of a news anchor.
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's initial move toward disarmament.
He noted that the US was instead continuing with sanctions designed to keep the pressure on.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at his rally.
"North Korea is doing really well", he said.
"There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
We have a wonderful relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results - ending missile tests, helping with hostage releases and repatriating the remains of American servicemen.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to be a statesman, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's population was left homeless, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for international emergency relief.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster preparedness department, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the constant earthquakes that affect Indonesia, the country is very ill prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not common on other coastlines.
A tsunami warning was issued in Palu, but a tsunami warning is apparently missing, and this has likely affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, travel between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding as he campaigns for the presidency next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative belief system.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See, Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalises at the last minute against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri a mere 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team trailed 1-0.
He pointed at the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball was flying high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball slipped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball, players like Shaq always try to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think about it too much and I just took the shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker delivered a heeled delivery to Mateo Kovacic before he picked up speed in midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's half of the pitch.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle of the field.
He then made a long pass that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished against the farthest pole with a left-footed shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster preparedness department said early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in debris from buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 on the Richter scale quake struck on Friday, creating waves up to 20 feet high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7.55am at Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are urging anyone in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Assistant Police Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with the dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that could be crucial to the investigation".
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed in the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
Residents will now be told that it will be several hours before they can re-enter.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman arrives crying.
She keeps saying, "It's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the checkpoint and another car just outside.
A number of officers were inside the barricade, monitoring the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and report to log 247 by September 30th.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest monument to be hit by the debate on 'rewriting history'
Removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical, puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The storm of images during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's brilliant portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure many still consider worthy of reverence.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure who represents one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and remembrance".
A boar attacked and killed a Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured pulse and smeared with blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He had reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next door was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and bruised", said the cousin, surnamed "Wu", quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police gather evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is a rare occurrence, but there have been previously recorded cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man severely injured.
Ten years ago, a 1,000-pound pig ran into a Welsh farmer's tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
Those nappies, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rains over much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters off Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall and flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure trough is forming across the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will drop up to 8 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low pressure drain and create heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will cause dangerous storm surges, floodwaters and possibly desert landslides.
The tropical moisture will produce rainfall of up to 51 to 76 mm per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, particularly over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high probability of rapidly deteriorating storm surges due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to go out into the desert on foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn rivers into gullies and thunderstorms will create strong local winds and dust storms.
The low pressure trough approaching will bring heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of an overall precipitation of more than 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall of their rainy season.
Scattered tropical storm winds will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, and expand later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, temperatures can fluctuate widely throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain moderately warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There's a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures above 85 degrees Fahrenheit [26°C] from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.
It could be up to 80 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
Over 20 million people watched Thursday's stirring testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued with stations interrupting regular programming to report on Friday's late developments: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh, while drunk, groped her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional deposition that he was 100% certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, 20.4 million people were likely to watch it on Friday.
The company recorded average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewership figures from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch shows in offices.
To put it in perspective, that's the equivalent of a game during the NFL playoffs or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionated hosts have strongly backed Kavanaugh's appointment, topped the list with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught in front of open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, as protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the jury's hearing.
He stood there staring downward for several minutes as he was being yelled at and CNN was live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he wanted to have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television stations were live-streaming a few hours later as the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote by the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor on the assumption that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee within the next week, as the Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was influential because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK PM accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page, her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "totally ridiculous".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail has been set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Sheriff's Department says a task force of Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens have been assisting with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local police for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-8 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's the kind of thing you're always afraid of", Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater registered 183 gas and ash spills in 24 hours.
The center monitored the room and vibrations over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, since a quake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back the robber maids, throwing powder paint and creating dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Fighting also broke out later that day, with police using their batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met by unionist demonstrators chanting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
The situation in the region remains tense, one year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped out on the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year was one of our best.
I saw my parents crying for the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best known leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are getting bigger and bigger", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
He said that the European Parliament had been given the task of preparing the draft budget for the next European elections.
Londonderry: men arrested after house hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30pm BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a crossbow shot at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga give Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
The upstart Livingston surprised Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have not won a league title this season and face the leaders Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Until then, the Rangers will have a visit from Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, is building up their unbeaten streak to six games, and head coach Holt still hasn't had a losing season since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing his chance at a cash-out.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their straightforward style of play created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the front of the net, whereupon Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the net after slipping in to hit Craig Halkett's crossed head in front of the net.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could cause problems for the team in dead-ball situations.
And it was under those circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston made an opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to make the field goal for Menga, who made a touchdown and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated possession but struggled to get through the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot out of the frame during another of Livingston's death ball situations.
Continuous passes came into Livingston's court, but were averted, and two requests for a penalty kick  after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand on the ball  were denied.
"Fenomenality" from the Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal effort and a strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastically and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their style of play and lineup are largely unchanged since their return to the top flight, but a large chunk of the credit goes to Holt for the way he's strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They've been really good under Gerrard at times, but they played below the level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness  only once they got the home team naked  and it's a sudden wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle of the points table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen on areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents  many of them Kurds  also took notice and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest seen as a hero by some German Turks and derided as an autocrat by others.
Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and notify his family.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been re-routed, and motorists are being advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during riot
Six correctional officers were injured during a riot at a maximum security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was a disturbance at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and the disturbances are still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the riot, which involves eight inmates and takes place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff are on duty to deal with the ongoing unrest at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are aware that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer periods behind bars".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, probation officers were called to the prison to deal with a major riot in which employees were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's most likely to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern United States, creating a risk of storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 millimeters of rain with isolated amounts of up to 152 millimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with a potential of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the storm flood risk, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Flooding is a very serious issue, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Survey, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the second-lowest drought category", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa remains at hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore decreases in strength.
So it's expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force Monday afternoon or evening.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico could be heavy, posing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 millimeters of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 254 millimeters", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert region of the United States", reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and floodwaters in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4am BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers are urging anyone with cell phone records of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the Democratic Party's "wickedness and anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's reckless and monstrous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been subjected to "the malice, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying claims by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most gifted legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record in public service", he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect reference to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking of the importance of Republicans showing up to the polls in the midterm elections.
"In five weeks, we will face one of the most important decisions of our lives.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me", he said.
"That's why I travel around, fighting for great candidates".
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and block".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 were killed, many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high hit the coast at dusk, sucking in many deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach, they didn't run right away and they were victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster preparedness, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open ocean at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that many survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster response agency has released aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Frost continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometer coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", they said.
The government was criticized on many fronts on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived within the timeframe for the warning.
Amateur footage shared on social media can be heard of a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings of the approaching tsuamien to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending relief cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but there is still a dire need for food and basic necessities among the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
This is really bad.
World Vision workers from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu City, where workers are seeking shelter under fences set up in the yard at their account.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses", he said.
This is really bad.
Even as relief organizations began the hard work of re-establishing relief efforts, complaints were made that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid, supplies and personnel may only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can open up international assistance, but there's no status yet".
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held on to the missing in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that illuminate the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up from a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers rescued a woman trapped under debris for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had been training two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr Gendon told how, in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray fleabane instead of two blue.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered", he says.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Thieves stole $26,750 Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport Police.
The driver had emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more cash, Detective Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "ran up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a purse that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The entity formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has alternated between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, Jay-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory strike against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly government grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have issued statements on artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the top spot in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next big achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China division.
Lee acknowledged past technology competitions sponsored by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that's grabbing the academic leaders, it's the big companies", Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stellar university students to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered work permits.
The State Council of China issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations' distribution of money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence that will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, US legislation attempting to establish a national safety commission for artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's bids to gain EU and NATO membership.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has applied for membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's predominantly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will be the 50% required to make the vote valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, access to associations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote and enforce it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said that at 1 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I voted today because of my children.We belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name that would open up membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism and to the fight against terrorism.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
He said a "yes" vote would be "a guarantee of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote  less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the Provisional Government since it took office in May last year.
See, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defence and scores.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced off against Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swerving out onto the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left turn and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal in that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in that sequence deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice pass down the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the furthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward punched the ball into the net just before it slid past goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage match at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
♪ Jokers will tease the Rockies ♪
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still a chance of making the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played one game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held on to a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title to claim.
"Even though we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level that I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited about playing under those conditions?"
The Nationals haven't announced their starting lineup yet for Sunday, but they're likely to put Scherzer in as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the field for the 34th time, practiced his pitches Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-hander from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republicans showing up to the polls in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
It's one of the big, big  you can't vote for me, but you actually vote for me.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means available.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to gain power and control.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "fight back and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and vicious and disgusting and lying".
He referred to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, triggering a loud cheer from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, oh no, wait a minute... that was really bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a large party.
They are intolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome  simply because we have made our point.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship was to criticize me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of my eight years as a local MP, Friday night meetings have been just like this.
Unfortunately, today the tone of many meetings is not that, and the promise of "friendlier, softer" policies, if they ever come into being, is far from being fulfilled.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed against whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political view began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions I would otherwise never have agreed to  whether on national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak my mind in public  and it really doesn't matter what I say  a long streak of rude messages follows on social media calling for voting down and opposing centrist policies and telling me that I should not be a Labour member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments made against me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and the determination of my colleagues who are daily confronted with sexism or racism, but who still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how common abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour needed to create a culture of tolerance.
But in reality it is no longer a spatial organisation and with each vote of no confidence or change in the electoral rules the party is getting smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years that if I cover myself up and don't make a big deal about it, I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago, when I was in school, I was provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect of our classrooms and set out to create better public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country is rolling towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for local voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of defection or political suitability will deter me from acting in what I believe is your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr to top team
Two late goals may have made the final score paint a not entirely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory in this amazingly entertaining match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the points table and the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defense as their better use of opportunity that carried the home team home, and Coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"Our matches have been demanding so far, and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did".
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr to the front, but a yellow card to Scottish international Rory Hughes, who was handed the match by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before halftime, scoring and then getting a solo, making it 17-5 to Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, cut the gap to five.
There was then a long break because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury, he was carried off the field on stretchers, and when the game resumed Ayr extended the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson could, after a line-out score, come back from behind the advancing Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the posts and followed up with another almost immediately after, the game was resumed after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent fiddler Gregor Henry off for the home court's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be taking the plunge into the restaurant business after it emerged he has taken the CEO position of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source hinted to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant market".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia hopes court to reopen Pacific route
Sailors patrol the flooded naval headquarters in La Paz.
A navy blue flag is flying over public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the slogan: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is my duty to take it back".
Throughout the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong, as is the desire to sail the Pacific again.
Hopes may be at their highest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course is waiting with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will give Bolivia the support that Chile  after decades of discussions  is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in his sentencing on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
But analysts say it is unlikely that the court will side with Bolivia  and that if it did, there would be no major changes.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, has no power to transfer Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
The International Court's ruling only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have backfired.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership", said Zárate.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both sides".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
'Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,' he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past".
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a resumption of stalled nuclear diplomacy three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "wishful dream" that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to make a declaration until Pyongyang has taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about eliminating an arsenal that it most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections of large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block out the sun completely, you'll find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the curtain on the runway for a collection of oddly large headwear as part of their SS19 collection, which impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the runway.
The most impressive work by Valentino was a lavish one with a broad feather-like shadow covering the models' heads.
There were other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had fused lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled scuba gear with a snorkel and mask, and another resembled a melted waffle.
And if you continue with the big fashion statements, you're in luck.
Scouts predict that the huge hats could be coming to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive at the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a two-foot wide shadow seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that was spread across social media has sent a new great creation down the runway  a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model that is displaying it.
The orange bust bag with bust fringes and a white leather handle was the most striking feature of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such an impact that it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a long history of excellent academic performance, and this continues in 2018 with a further string of outstanding results, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With up to 30,000 pupils around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it touches his heart".
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust between people from other countries.
We can look at the most recent test results this year, and language is at the top of the statistics with the highest pass rates in the independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received high A's.
Data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of pupils obtained A's in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also obtained A's.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now being considered as a subject choice on the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers could not fill vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More jobs in the future will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov poll of over 4,000 people in the UK, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those of developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, the languages taught differ between schools.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK as we look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this stage, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scotland's youth.
It's the right thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will most likely not play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games before the season opens.
"I don't need to fight before the season starts to get ready", he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five scheduled rallies for next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump's nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat is on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans face the risk of losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
When's Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (UTC) on the night between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will most likely address this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, which were strained by allegations of sexual misconduct and the anticipated Senate confirmation vote has been put on hold for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary goal of this strip election rally is to build momentum for Republicans facing a tough election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign said the five election rallies next week are aimed at "building energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign period", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
The evening's rally is being held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to draw Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man match was perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but a concept that the players believe in  especially in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we'll probably see that as a bit of momentum", Jordan Spieth said before he fired.
Europe has the advantage of course, they are four points ahead and there are 12 more points to play for.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points from four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green, setting a good example for his teammates.
The loud cheers grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important putt, which secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His putt, which secured them the match on the 15th hole, was met with a similar scream... the kind of scream that shows he doesn't think the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your own struggle", Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes to make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story in Ryder Cup history.
Europe's strange but lovable couples have scored four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow to and from the wild crowd shows that they are the ones who will be hardest to beat on Sunday and would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is secured by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably synchronized to each of their holes.
It is too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, in the morning of the four-man duel, when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeyes on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never even close to getting out of.
On Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball, two-team, two-player games are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in a flash.
Europe has been better off as a team so far and has built up a significant lead before the final day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the US, have questioned.
Europe is up 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe has a big advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The well-played duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in this morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States put up more of a fight in foursomes, winning four games, but still falling behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles games if they're to keep the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four straight points, and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four matches.
They crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two games on Saturday, had a few glimpses of genius, but now he's lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and took a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka  who is ranked third in the world.
Europe, however, is doing exactly as they want it to on a light breezy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas led the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They had a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team fought back after trailing by four points before the singles, but with the Furyks currently holding the trophy, they only need to score a draw to keep it.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems they cannot handle a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it won't disarm unilaterally if there's no trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, shutting down a nuclear test site and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally".
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as has been the case in the past from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and builds pressure with sanctions to achieve their goals by force and even opposes the 'declaration on the end of the war'", Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions reinforces our mistrust".
Ri did not mention plans for another summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the denuclearisation negotiations were to be with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so deadlocked".
Nevertheless, the tone of Rice's speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's launch of missiles at the US mainland was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened at the UN with "total annihilation" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for his courageous disarmament efforts, but said that much remains to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is quieted down.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to halt Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, while North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands" just hours later.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to shut down a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding steps".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep, designed to counter the growing macho culture of studying all night on a high caffeine diet.
One researcher has shown that students at the world's best universities often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the essay was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why don't I know about this until I'm on the exam?'
"She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits can improve academic and athletic performance and overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health department, says the university decided to offer the course after finding that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there's a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how poor sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part of the course, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression, and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
"We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect your health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of an all-nighter still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue, and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said. It even prevents weight gain because lack of sleep makes the brain think you're hungry, which is why you're constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped organize the course last year when he took one of Professor Czeisler's courses during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a university-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all graduates a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting an alarm to alert students to the harmful effects of electronic screen light, which can slow the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: goal from Menga down Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the road as Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to settle for a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first home win since a 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard only their second defeat in 18 games as manager, putting Hearts eight points clear of Ladbrokes Premiership leader.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, which an uninspired Ranger team couldn't answer.
Rangers now fall to sixth place while Livingston climbs to third behind Hibernian with only goal difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way for the Rangers as linebacker Calum Spence was treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that appeared to come from the highway section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semi-final by stalling past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, was holding the same 11 that shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents all over the pitch.
The Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Mengas' first-half delivery sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was a bust.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs made its way to captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear post.
The Rangers, however, took control, but they played more on hope than ability in the offensive game.
Alfredo Morales was not happy when referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless came together after a quarter of play.
The Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalie Liam Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovie Ejarias's tame shot.
Although Livis' opening in the 34th minute was somewhat accidental, it must be said to be worthy of their efforts alone.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a dead-ball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who took his time to find Menga, who could easily kick it into goal.
At halftime, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave way as the wingman threw the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the away team to play on their own premises with many long balls up the pitch from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have extended the lead into the final stretch of the match, but McGregor turned Jacobs down with a sure hand before Lithgow headed to the side of goal.
Rangers' alternate Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being tied with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson looked the other way here too.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning yearbook: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today  if we count...  was the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as peasant scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals is making".
Evans: "Stop it, this is it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A trial vaccine shows promise in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared in more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory to "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then injecting the cells back into them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "causes several cancers to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells are taken from patients and "taught" to attack cancer cells, has worked in treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After a disjointed appearance on Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was booed as he paid tribute to US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again helmet, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of the United States long ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the evening with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West's rant was posted on social media.
It's uncertain if Rock was trying to expose West by posting the tapes.
West also complained to the audience about being treated badly backstage because of his headgear.
"They were bullying me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on".
They were bullying me!
And they said I was deep down", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how far I've sunk?" and said he'd put on his Superman cap because it means, "You can't tell me what to do.
Try with love".
Audiences listened to his comments at least twice, and SNL staff seemed embarrassed, reports Variety, with one person who was present commenting: "There was a lot of silence in the studio".
West had been booked to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song "I Love It" while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: Thank you for not letting your cow out of the crowd".
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is just who he is, and that's fine".
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his 'art') who embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's got a license.
And so have we", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to "the entity officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rap colleague Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The accused is expected to appear in the lower court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are being reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is reaching out for toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his sword wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is outspoken about the stereotypical macho hero, saying that such TV characters often mean that young men feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believes "something has gone wrong" and asked how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is "very close to his heart".
"I'm very concerned lately about where we've gone wrong in the city with masculinity", he said.
"If we look at the problems of today, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of the very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and the streets that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time, how do we change this?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men".
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Kit is starring in a November remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best part of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so in that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Many infections are due to a lack of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicines in an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
House member Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations came from websites and supporters of the "far right".
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies", Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
The information released allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites like Gateway Pundit of RedState reported that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff, The Hill reports.
"This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a blatant lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This baseless accusation is completely untrue and a blatant lie".
Waters's announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It is a furious denial", wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests she doesn't have the right temperament to be a congresswoman.
If you're accused of something you didn't do, you shouldn't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
The prosecution's motives must not be questioned.
You have to keep your cool".
Fleischer compared Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is aiming to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Big if it's true", he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found", she continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my staff".
Johnny English hits again  amazing spy comedy starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent British-themed films, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - Born Again.
Will the bold, sarcastic self-satire about how badly we're doing become the country's new export option?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has been given permission to make roarers again - again.
He's, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife-edged Mr. Bean and a real laugh from the man who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international spy who left chaos in his wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the JE tribe.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the propellers were ringing against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humor feels rather underwhelming and strangely redundant, especially now that more "serious" series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film antics as Mr. Bean.
The endlessly current premise of the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field to the horror of the agent in charge  a sadly very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a pompous and combative prime minister who's already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And this is, of course, the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school superintendent at a top-notch school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with his hard-pressed former right-hander Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain, a role that Vicki Pepperdine plays.
Thus, Batman and Robin are back after the Royal Intelligence Service's exhausting efforts when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being flattered by charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough embark on their furious, risky escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates sheer ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the guns are fired in the film's closing sequence, but as well-meaning and energetic as it is, there's a feel of children's television about it.
It's pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't help but think with the other Johnny English films, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to go along with plan for four-day work week with unchanged pay for Britons
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is said to be considering a radical plan to make the British people content with a four-day workweek but pay for five.
The party will reportedly have business leaders use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend without a pay cut.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic goal of pulling the country in a more favorable direction for workers.
The Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "A policy proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year".
"It will not happen in a day, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the Party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of workers and the Party's overall strategy for industry".
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day workweek during the 2017 general election campaign.
The aim, however, is not unanimously supported in the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not the policy of the party and is not under consideration in the party".
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting recording his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to wrest power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploiters" in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also raise doubts about whether current shareholders of water utilities will get their money back, as a Labour government could "offset" them against immoral practices.
He also confirmed plans to have workers on company boards and to set up ownership funds to distribute 10 per cent of the share value of private companies to employees who are entitled to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their vote.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course", said Kennedy.
"When I went into the hearing, I told them I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was steely, determined and clear".
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be carved in stone.
"I have made my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and otherwise would require a very violent indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it in the strongest terms", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see how that would change anything".
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizens Festival , an annual music festival with a very impressive lineup of artists and an equally impressive goal: to end world poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn to watch concerts by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, while raising awareness of the ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was launched in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful action that can raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach their goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really create change, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism  i.e. people feeling they are making a difference by signing a petition online or posting on Twitter?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its members directed at various targets.
They believe that these actions have prompted world leaders to make binding targets and policies worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 targets and actions that had been achieved as a result of their actions, amounting to over $10 billion already paid or raised.
The group estimates that these funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based venture between investors and businesspeople that aims to "help children reach their full potential" and pledges $35 million to address nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, other governments and citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It's going to be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we're going to stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement, it will succeed because we are stronger together".
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York City, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman set to host.
US Navy could use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, US Home Secretary says
"If necessary", Washington could use its navy to block Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke reveals to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's interference in Syria  especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext to expand their energy sales.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe", he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has the ability with our navy to ensure that there is free passage on the sea lanes and if necessary we can also block them to ensure that their energy does not get to the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance  a nonprofit organization that considers itself to be "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were basically the same.
"The economic opportunities with Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokesmen, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the choice of supplier", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The American position is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the BDI, has asked the United States to avoid interfering in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with third party interference in our energy supply", said BDI head Dieter Kempf after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "strongly considers" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is "considering strongly" to run for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
At a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman at the forefront", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren expressed his opinion of President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI will investigate the case before the vote".
However, a poll on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own backgrounds do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent supported the possible candidacy.
The opinion poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for and 48% against a possible lineup.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates being discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he'll announce his final decision in January.
Sarah Palin is bringing up Track Palin's PTSD at a rally for Donald Trump.
26-year-old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he comes home makes me relate to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers come home with", she told an audience at a Trump voter rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become tougher, and they are wondering if there is respect for what their colleagues on the ground and in the air and all the other members of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. delivered a nonpartisan statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the August lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal law, Grace v. Sessions, has not been released.
She says that her partner "and his violent gang members sons" had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come from, as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US asylum law overturned a 2014 decision by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle", the non-partisan statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejected immigrants harms the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide necessary labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions' immigration judges stripped the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his proclamation of the law on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems  or just all the serious problems  that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, efforts to find survivors in Palu become desperate.
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We're short of clean water".
Residents now returned to their ruined homes to sort through soaked belongings and salvage what they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals, also hit by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were unable to keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were lying outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
He was moved to tears as he related how the tremor shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was hit by a broken wall, I think", Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of unethical practices and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that touted the benefits of U.S.-China cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the China Daily's paid printing in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional election.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, with several rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war would hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for many years, which is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an editorial in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China "is escalating the use of the nefarious methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find few dissenting voices, and you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans alienating women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans are backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against sexual assault allegations, analysts are warning that they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has stirred up a stir of emotion, and most Republicans have already made it public that they want to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be undone", Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes' (Arizona) request for an FBI investigation in the 11th hour will assuage angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday  they don't forget tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters at a Senate rally shouted "November is coming!" as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights", said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg.
"People say it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among women swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters  18-29 years old  who rarely vote, despite disliking the president".
Even before Ford's public accusations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"It's become a worse mess for Republicans", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final result or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it's also about how the Republicans handled this and how they handled her", points out Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA  a group that supports Democrats in being elected  to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have a divided opinion as to who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the latter having a little more on his side.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh either probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At Flake's urging, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh, while drunk, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech giant's latest project is called Inrupt, and it's a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the Inrupt plan is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup business.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology, allowing people to create their own "personal online data collection" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser at the same time.
The unique feature of online personal data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to pool resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook or Google about whether they should completely change everything so that all their business models suddenly become redundant".
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Chaplain of the First World War Victorian Cross honored
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross for fighting in World War I is being commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won England's highest military decoration.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's landmark achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire".
Later, he ran to the front line and led his men with "great manhood" before single-handedly attacking an artillery piece and disabling three cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that humbled me".
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores true heroism".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 but got Gurli Pig instead.
Imagine you've been up all night watching the star-studded Bellator 206 and then you're denied the main event.
There were 13 matches on the San Jose show, including six matches on the main show, and they were shown all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face off, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the broadcast switched to show Gurli Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying up early for this very fight.
A Twitter fan described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a sort of sick joke".
"By law, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pig Gurli, yes".
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they would work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can make it work", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the switch was made, I got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical glitch.
But that was the law.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We're gonna settle for five games instead of six, which is what we usually do, and we're gonna try to give our fans something extra, and then we're gonna overtime.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley had a "lower opinion" of sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else growing up because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he entered the senior class that "not everyone is like me".
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was speaking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program, saying that he felt "less valuable" than everyone else growing up because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, the feelings of being worthy and different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and used her participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man  the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it's hard to find someone his age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age. He went to his first Olympics at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to London 2012  when he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it only occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection  Proud of Heather Small  which had meant a lot in the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.

Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's got to do something about his form if he doesn't want to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is the record holder for the 12th time in the competition, which is held every two years, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the American scene as usual, the five-time major winner had to cheer and practice his game in the hope of correcting the mistakes.
Even at the height of his career, he had the most straight drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalizes stray shots.
And if the court wasn't big enough to fill the mouth, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate British Open winner Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are starting the 12 singles matches, start strong, Mickelson's fight could be decisive.
Furyk expressed no surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself".
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's given so much to these teams before and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined he'd play more, but that's how it happened, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everybody else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to pick on people, and he's good to have in the team room", he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's contributing much more than just the game".
Captain of Europe Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was just about to be caught before the finish line with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just exactly won", says Bjørn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to a 10-6 overall lead at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that this isn't over.
I want it full of garbage by tomorrow.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said that I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side  the best golfers in the world".
Pleased with his players' performance on a difficult course, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is individual performance that counts, and that is something else entirely.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on every parameter as a golfer.
That's what the players need to understand. Bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he's also going to get the best out of himself".
It is different for opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performances than in the partnership game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has experienced his own set of upsets on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, then losing when Europe performed the Miracle on Medina.
"I remember every word", he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want a good start, like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We're going to put our teams in that order and put the players on the field in the order that we feel we want to, and we're going to try to create magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the relegation and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the standings.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it will secure us all the way through", Bjørn said of his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship is being delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be ready in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price tag, local media reports.
The commissioning of the largest ship in the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but backlog problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy back in 2007 are to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to have a powerful cannon, a large variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest frigates is a reduced maintenance requirement: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships  that are supposed to make Germany appear as an overseas power  will already be obsolete when deployed, reports Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be manned by a crew of 120 sailors, only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also proved to be too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability to make future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an original price tag of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet was "running out of ready-to-go ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were ready to join the fleet.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to uncover how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows bats, bats, bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the bat's activities throughout the season.
Data are also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show which species is doing what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation measures such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and Britain has fallen dramatically over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban development projects that affect the herders and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials, and attacks by pets.
Bat mice are not actually blind.
But because they hunt primarily at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced echolocation technology to locate insects and fly around obstacles.
The NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often gather data, inspect nests, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The area's warden, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good bat area", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is much that is unknown about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you to understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing any maintenance on property, since the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to lend a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how populations evolve".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape allegations against him "fake news" and says people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which brought the allegations.
The Portuguese-Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
What they said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They'll promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal, you know?
You're gonna be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine", the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called "an unforgivable publication of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the player was seeking compensation for "moral depravity in a class similar to the charge, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the report filed in the municipal court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99 percent of the time" grabbed by "the one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly shamed".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to reverse the deal as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have taken place and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing carmakers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily cut production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that longer waiting at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"The way I see it, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant", said Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are expressing fears of leaving the EU without a deal on crossborder trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of carmakers is the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which the car industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "constructed to precisely avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal.We want the best deal that not only allows us  as I call it  to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what have been successful supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory's competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and a trusted member of the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience is that once these jobs go, they don't come back".
A government spokesman said: 'We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "be postponed another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking over the shoulder of special counsel Robert Mueller as he investigates Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been a rumor in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president via Article 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and word got out that he was gonna resign.
Instead, a meeting was arranged for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There's no date set, it could be this week, I can imagine it could be pushed up a week with everything going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists would challenge that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to TV journalists playing up to the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree with them playing up to the camera".
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is taking more questions from the press than any president before him", she said, adding without citing a source: "We've looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States direct questions, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to provide ample opportunity for that, and you've seen us do that over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in place of the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends public hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the press.
Health minister contacts EU health workers in Scotland after Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their country's gratitude and wishes for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its devolved public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continue and decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work for the benefit of patients and communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was operated on after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the incident happened before halftime.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell over there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center was complete.
Harris added that there are "no details on the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to determine when he sustained the damage.
Abercrombie is a sophomore in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which puts him at 18 tackles total this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in Britain, and the extra money is to help the homeless, the Conservative Party says.
This move is intended to dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Treasury expects it will provide £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in Britain, to the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after the highest earners.
The increase in stamp duty will hit individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The additional charge, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-dwelling purchases and purchase for rent, can reach 3%.
The Treasury expects it to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is bought by people living abroad, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land they don't use, and asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing situation".
Corbyn has proposed a number of striking housing reforms, including controlling rents and stripping landlords of the ability to put people on the street if they comply with their leases.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: 'Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life would be better for each generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy houses as it is for hardworking Britons.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the street is still too widespread".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland manager"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to eventually become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are now third in League One, three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a match with the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always attracted me.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in coaching clubs".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio. He is also the current manager of the English club.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no qualms about following such established names at such a big club and had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
"The structure and facilities of this club make it undoubtedly a Premier League club", he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll only consider myself successful here if I can get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his coaching career after a stint as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month flop as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to return from relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads", he recalls of his time in Alloa.
"I honestly believed that coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I was doing fine, earning a decent income and having some success.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of stuff you have to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still that kind of stress and pressure that comes with coaching, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and I'm doing it. I've never felt more comfortable with myself in my entire adult life".
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12 and 1pm BST.
The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 5:30, study shows
The heat wave this summer has boosted the profits of pubs in England but has put greater pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants fell by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at the CGA who compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup meant that July followed the pattern of June, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase in sales, except that restaurants are hit harder now.
The fall of 1.8% in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focusing on the sale of drinks fared best and experienced growth similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want a drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages rose by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%.'
Paul Newman, an analyst of the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a 4.8% drop in sales year on year will really hurt on top of rising costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a much-needed respite".
The overall increase in sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in newly launched brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data from 47 different groups.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children  under 11  have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study shows.
A survey of 20,000 schoolchildren in grades four through nine reveals a rise in "fake Insta" pages.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted
20% of pupils said they had a "main account" that they could show their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 has a social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from fourth grade onwards reveals a surge in "fake Insta" accounts  a reference to the photo-sharing service Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of pupils said they had a "main account" which they could show their parents, while they also had private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, the head of HMC, said: "It's frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete and chairman Ian Bettie described the move as a good opportunity for decision-makers in sport to benefit from her vast 10 years of experience at international level.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit from having her on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help set a direction for sport in Scotland".
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a frequent commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It's been a lot of hard work, but I'm perfectly healthy, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reviews online
A breast-pump company shared the views online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what has been called "the world's first soundless breast pump", the consumer technology magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that is designed to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay to a song that goes, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see my tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't yuccas, these are my breasts".
The message is, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I'm breastfeeding".
But the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed response from viewers, many saying it pokes fun at the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth", wrote one user.

Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What a callous ad".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "incredibly funny".
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd have one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have been dancing with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the ad is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses, and fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even walk out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we would highlight the challenges of breast pumping while also showing in an entertaining and recognisable way the freedom that the new pump can provide".
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother walked two runways for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of migrant children being detained has exploded, even though the number of border crossers has not changed, due in part to tougher rhetoric and the Trump administration's tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by coming forward and accepting a child.
The risk of repatriation increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that they had arrested several individuals seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had clean criminal records.
"Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt these people", said Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, up from 60 days, aid workers say.
Many use video calls instead of appearing and pleading their case for legal residence before an immigration judge.
Those found to be unfit to stay are deported quickly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or escape attempts, according to aid workers and reports from the system in recent months.
Advocates of better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger facilities like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to monitor for childhood suffering.
They added that moving to a tent city without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign troops' presence in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism and they will be "met by corresponding means".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared all Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee front, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fear" that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these repatriations", he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be made available to rebuild the country until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held city of Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be taken against jihadists from the Nusra Front, a splinter group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has imposed conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to 'reviewing the legislation of the current constitution' and warned against interference.
That's why Trump is winning another term.

"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos is entertaining.

Big money is making its way into the tight midterm elections for the House of Representatives.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is receiving huge sums of money because of a tie between two congressional districts, with two congressmen vying for the same seat.
This newly redistricted Pittsburgh suburb is creating problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb is up against another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was illegally put up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th District has started a fight for funding between the major party committees, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning a highly-watched primary in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support for China, but changed its mind.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with little protest from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's leadership team.
State Department officials decided to recall top U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, a continuation of last year's meeting, which was seen as a step toward preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping any consideration of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal of the importance Americans place on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further hardship or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the case, which was described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who would like to discuss internal considerations if they remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Know the story
The next obstacle could very well be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also reportedly going to focus his investigation on whether the Trump campaign secretly collaborated with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress were to fall into new hands, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to face voters again and, eventually, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties and I am not saying that Trump's end is inevitable, nor is his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the fight goes on.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed afterwards.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns and the irreversible march of democracy moves up or down.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who's going to decide the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since this newspaper reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president, challenging his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times's presentation is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the FBI's recently-requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is terminated or not properly conducted? "Or if he is approved for the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And, more importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers face SK Rapid Wien on Thursday, and after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a win against Austria will give them a good chance of advancing from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut before the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the stick home, but all in all, I think it was a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We're hoping for three points, but it's going to be tough because they had a good performance in the last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
This past year has been tough, with all the things that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and be successful".
Anxiety about retirement savings makes women sleepless
Although the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their families about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance for Nationswide.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for the responsibility of caring for you if you do not tell them in advance what you want.
Use your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to find out how to pay for expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by traditional long-term care insurance, cash-based life insurance or self-insurance with your own funds  as long as you have the means to do so.
Get the legal paperwork done, take the legal battles down the drain.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications routes out of action, emergency workers have been unable to receive information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the Central Slavic economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Center, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Rim and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that swept the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic as people were reminded of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on a $500 bond without bail, KTUU reports.
He was arraigned in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "absolutely not guilty", the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently pending in Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after explaining her son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and roads, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media sites are circulating videos showing the moment the earthquake struck.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorism suspects in New York City sentenced to the rare death penalty.
Public prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare death sentence that was last carried out for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who came in the way were run over.
The prosecution's death sentence requires the prosecution to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, as required by the Southern District of New York's death penalty policy.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible outcome of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov with a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of gang-related murder typically used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "monstrous, vicious and depraved".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, bodily harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,' the statement of intent said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last released a defendant in a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but ended up serving a life sentence in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York state case was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and, according to court documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he was doing.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag on his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life in prison without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had previously asked the prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
Conservative minister thinks Nigel FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative rally today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians needed to "mark the pressure" from Eurosceptics  after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
May's challenge to unify the deeply divided party is underscored by the fact that Conservative Remainers are taking part in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track amid attacks from both Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels , thus forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or 'chaos'.
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he was scrapping the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough minister added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap Chequers.'
Regarding the background to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight the world war to be subordinate to anyone.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejected any suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely wrong".
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who are actually on the streets getting us elected.
Now, stop playing Chequers and start listening".
As a sharp remark to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail to make the decision from the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a question of trust between us  the people  and our political class", he said.
"They want to betray Brexit, but we are here to tell them we will not let them get away with it".
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: 'You must make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit feels the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain".
Meanwhile, Remains marched through Birmingham before a two-hour march through the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservative Anti-Brexit banners after the group's proliferation this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security concerns with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"They are the people who claim to have control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he said.
"This is ridiculous.
He also called for the EU to be more open to the EU's citizens.
Warren "strongly considers" running for president
House member Senator Elizabeth Warren "is seriously considering a run for president" after the November midterm elections.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a city council meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, is set to seek re-election in November against state Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There's been some speculation about whether she'd challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the contestants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman at the front".
Arrest in the LSU Sims shooting.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested Friday for an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting Friday to ask for help identifying a man in the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of his injuries", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present, in possession of a weapon and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-3 freshman who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role in the race.
From the front, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to knocking Hamilton off the grid as he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was in the pits first, leaving Hamilton to fight traffic in the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went into the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front as the Ferrari driver, after some wheel contact, reluctantly had to leave the inside track after a double defence at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, failing to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place in an attempt to finish fast.
He had to pit on lap 44, but could not increase the pace on the last eight laps, which is why Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place", said Hamilton.
Really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were "wicked and disgusting and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document?
No, no, no, I got it.
I didn't leak anything".
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Did we leak... no, we didn't leak anything", he added in a nod to the senator.
Feinstein got the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I have not covered up Dr. Ford's allegations, and I have not leaked her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did".
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at the election rally on Saturday: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
As the president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually assaulting three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to benefit their own cause.
"They have no qualms about taking back power.
You can see the malice, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum up to gain power and control", the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars did well again after losing Friday's Elite League game to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly took the lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied at home before Dwyer again took the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants coming off victorious in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist by Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as assistant, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a hectic first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind the Cownies' tie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead on the first pitch when he scored his second goal late in the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the score with a fine 27/37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the win with the team's fifth goal midway through the last period.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, are home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of airline passengers avoided earthquakes
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died trying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was delayed on the runway, was airlifted safely.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
According to Australia's ABC News, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We obtained a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are devastated", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster preparedness department has announced restricted access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to reach them", said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes are flying in emergency supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute another ambulance comes with more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
All the shops have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crashes in Micronesia lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it was unable to locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to locate the man.
The airline has not returned any requests for further information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been rushed to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers remained in hospital until Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very shallow water.
"That was really lucky", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could dive to the water to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working to renovate a nearby pier also helped with the rescue by using a rubber dinghy to bring people ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts are tracing the time line to the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded its evidence hearing Saturday during the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telephonic data to piece together the course of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several different cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the witness box on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When asked by the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data showed that they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hip hop trio would like to challenge the negative perception of the genre by giving their music a positive message.
The High Breed from Bristol believes hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to basics and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in the UK because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couples after firing them for "racist" texting
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message by mistake from the mother complaining that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied being racist, but likened the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her horror at learning that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NOT A BLACK PERSON any more", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she ended up sending it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former nanny, who was African-American, had been bad at her job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and compensation of $350 a day for the six months she was supposed to live with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like this", she told the paper on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racist and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she would not have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children in the care of someone you had been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
I mean it".
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
It is not very friendly", added the investment adviser.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People's Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the first person to read it before it was published.
It's quite fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became".
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothed cat, would have been optimistic even if his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as "a very important part of our family" and says that her father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who accomplished something: you're proud of them, even if it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
"Though it was his work and his imagination, "he used to say it was Paddington's fault".
Saying goodbye to a dying daughter over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably wouldn't survive", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying she was going to die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later, then.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart beating was slowly losing its effect.
She was dead a few minutes before, and now the body's shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get my act together".
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I bowed my head and the tears kept flowing.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Grieving Women Try to Stop Suicide Bombers
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he went into depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I go through every day", she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising cook with a tainted smile.
"His smile was familiar to all.
People said his smile lit up the room".
But he stopped working before he died because he was really sick.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about it spreading".
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can reach out and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go off on your own  you need to talk to someone".
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't even make eye contact with them".
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to get over it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for  a time-limited investigation of limited scope  we might get some consensus", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee had "fallen off its horse" amid the stuck-in partisan situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate their case?
Their reticence is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do poorly, as expected, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the deciding vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from South Korea's Ministry of Reunification and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to smugglers contributed to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comment.
In time, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border up to North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forcibly repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea  which are technically still at war  have improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This follows the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea at a global level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances, we cannot disarm on our own", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, "hysterical" and said his temperament was not suited to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his high school years, he almost screamed and was about to cry.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's statement proved he couldn't sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with his statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi sidestepped when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if he is confirmed and the Democrats win a majority in the House.
"I would say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly not the court he's sitting on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on Obama's health care reform or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It can't happen that a hysterical, biased person has to run for a judge's job and expect us to say, 'Yeah, isn't that just great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger coming out, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?" I said, "I think it is".
She continued: "I had great support from a woman who was my boss, who said that she cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm mad".
And then she just kept going.
And I thought, "That's brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of one of my first jobs in an office overwhelmingly male, where I often cried out in anger, where I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of -- and dragged down the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry and they'll be happy they got you".
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder was really frustrated and decided she might as well run for president herself.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision", she said to me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech about not running, she was overwhelmed with emotion  gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and reach voters instead of electors, and anger over sexism  that she got a lump in her throat.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", recalls Schroeder of the press' reaction to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"She was crying"?
This is how the US-China trade war can be a boon to Beijing
The opening rounds of the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and while the battle is far from over, experts say that division between the two countries may be to Beijing's advantage in the long run.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion basically affects half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US$60 billion worth of goods.
China has vowed to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to budge for the time being.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they are giving in, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it will be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less interdependent.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create a breeding ground for an economy that could spiral out of control in either country, and it's actually much more dangerous than previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research associate with the Asia-focused Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to receive refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees to return and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,' he said.
The government maintains control over the areas devastated by terrorists and is working to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the refugees to return to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was happy to accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the American team 16.5 - 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six straight on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back as Captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, shot his drive into the lake on par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari performed well in all rounds and became 1 of 4 players to have a 5-0-0 record since 1979, when the tournament's current format began.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off with 5&4 by the lowest-ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Number one in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his pocket, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who took down American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
That's a ridiculous stat for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who has won 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find form all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had solid play throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a counterattack.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, and I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we'll move on.
I love those 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta lighten up on the hat.
We were defeated".
Algae blooms updated: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in algal concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, there are reports of scattered blooms in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier , suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The algae bloom spreads over a 130-mile coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are minor blooms about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
There have also been sightings of blooms in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or at sea in Pinellas County have been reported during the past week, low to high concentrations in the ocean outside Hillsborough County, background concentration to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentration to high concentrations in or at sea outside Sarasota County, background concentration to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentration to high concentrations in or at sea outside Lee County and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory distress continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No respiratory distress has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
