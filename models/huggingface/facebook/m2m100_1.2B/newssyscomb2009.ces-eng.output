Right-wing populists win in Austria with 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both sides of the previous large coalition and a significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) has suffered severe losses, where the position of current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously shaken.
On the other hand, the elected leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Korutan lieutenant Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent against the last election in 2006.
Even worse was the result of the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these big parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially among the people who caused early elections, a literally catastrophic outcome.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People’s Party had a significant advance over the SPÖ in preferences.
Voters, however, have clearly punished them for letting the government fail.
In the early reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party’s chairman and former deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers estimate that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s presidency.
Such a development would apparently facilitate the way to the ever more likely outcome from the election outcome, i.e. to the resumption of a large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the Free Party (FPÖ) gained 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes – however, the Social Democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when the People’s Party agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a joint government, which even triggered sanctions by the European Union.
On this development obviously bets Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and presupposes a return to Vienna to national politics.
In the parliament, the Greens lost slightly, falling from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties clearly crossed the four-percent threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India May Cold
If it failed to solve the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegal harvesting broom, it would, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, have led to a certain cooling of Czech-India relations.
The minister said this in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherji.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that the executive could be difficult to interfere in judicial affairs.
However, he said that in the case of Peter Šváchy, who was acquitted of charges and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dárdžiling, to whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emile Kucher, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best if he appealed to a higher instance.
He can then apply for release on bail and wait for a sentence on freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also stated the same during the talks.
"He recommends appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side has already provided such assistance to them.
“We have the utmost interest inining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as ČTK said, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We consider it really a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
Responding to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with matters, the minister avoided.
“I’ve gotten a lot of promises,” he said.
Czechs fight for seabed
It will go to a wall electronic map that shows Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the 30-member team of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Maritime Law.
Its head, the director of the division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally complements it.
There will be enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides an unknown world, rich in natural resources.
There can be found oil, ore and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
Bigger than the mainland
The coastal states have begun to compete vehemently for new underwater territories.
The United Nations Convention on Human Rights was signed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends to several hundred kilometers from the coast of a given country.
It has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its substrate which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
A country’s application to the Commission for the definition of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of years of preparatory work.
One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
Recently, Australia was the first country to significantly expand its submarine powers.
But New Zealand also won – the size of the seabed, which the commission admitted last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits they will get from using the seabed in the future will be invaluable, as they promise.
Other countries will gradually submit applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the moment they ratified the "Convention of Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor region begins, declared by convention to be "the common heritage of mankind".
No country has an exclusive status anymore.
The right of mining in this area is granted by the international institutions established by the Convention.
“The seabed is not a Klondajk,” said Mikulka, adding that “their individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually stipulated.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, along with investors from a few other countries, granted it the status of a “pioneering investor”.
It has permission to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is there, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatras.
"There can be mined on an area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the division, Robert Sandev, presents one such concrete.
It reminds of a little potato or, with a bit of fantasy, a fabulous scheme that, according to legend, revived Golem.
German Special Operations Forces Release Hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in resolving the hostage crisis, experts have arrived.
When the situation worsened, special units were prepared, but no deployment occurred.
More details of the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are gradually coming to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the ministries, both experts from the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9 were released on the scene, as well as experts in logistics from the Technisches Hilfswerk (Technisches Hilfswerk).
A spokesman for the two ministries said on Monday afternoon that German forces were not needed because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of forced liberation.
The Egyptian government said it had accepted the help offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
“Fortunately, this did not happen,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian guides in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, hostages were moved to border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as the details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
The rescuers are now in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the release of the hostages is under the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
It is not yet known when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, all five tourists, even with special forces, should depart on one of the Airbuss of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House rejects rescue plan
The first house of the U.S. Congress passed a $700 billion bailout package.
The Dow Jones index has fallen sharply.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, there was no majority in favour of a program to ease the chaos in the financial markets.
With this dramatic action, supporters were desperately trying to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, urged MEPs to give their approval before the vote, although, as he said, the plan was not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the voting, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
Investors are concerned that the bailout plan could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index’s value rose to fall sharply after the announcement of the package’s collapse.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the plan to enter into force, it needs the approval of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Travel agencies report increasing number of reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the turnover of travel bookings for the coming months has increased significantly compared to the previous year - in the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains untouched.
In the winter season, travel agencies registered a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already increased reservations available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover in October was about eleven percent higher than in 2007.
The results are based on the GfK figures, which each month assesses booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and interpolates it to the overall market.
This result included travel bookings that were made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak rate of the dollar, travel to the United States is mostly sought, DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in reservations is about one-third.
In addition, German targets are sought after by Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
First of all, organized tours are in the course, said DRV Chairman Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising expenses for energy and food, there are costs "for the client easier to calculate than for an individually organized holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money, among other things, by taking advantage of early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was very good, so compared to the previous year, a higher turnover will again be recorded - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated popcorn, beer from stupids and prominents in costumes from famous designers.
For the first time in a beer bar.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is a blonde, a TV host and wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we’re not even three minutes on the beer bar, and we’re already hit by photographers and filled with memory cards – that’s a pity for me, because I’m at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems that my cheap costume has fulfilled its purpose.
I’m here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my feeling of comfort was rather limited.
But right upon arrival at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a female suit or leather trousers; no one looks disgusted or embarrassingly touched - everything is completely normal.
The strange sights at the banana stand in chocolate are harvested only by my curtain.
A woman in Munich warns me that I was wrong with her: “On the left you are free, in the middle you are virgin, on the right you are married, and on the back you are widowed.”
They hide from the back to the left.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don’t engage so much, wearing simple plated hats with the inscription “To drunk to get dressed!” and pulling out on the passing naked asses.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and has also come to the Oktoberfest for the first time.
It seems to him “gorgeous”, with an extended “óóó”.
He tells me this after he relieved himself of a drunkard.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
Bob is thus one of the feared "Wildbiesler", as in Bavaria it is called in the public to the freely urinating people.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, there is a crowd of health workers running around the area where the Oktoberfest takes place, who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Healthcare practitioners always appear in herds - in four they wear covered bearings from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to beer lawns: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the coffin of this coffin is not visible.
“That’s only those who can’t go on anymore,” one of the doctors calls me in response to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police have revealed the name of the victim
The name of a sixty-three-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being struck by a car in Essex was released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 15-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of careless driving.
He was released on police bail.
Turkish diplomacy expands
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers sought to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the eastern shore of the Bosphorus, only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neorenaissance style.
The tour guide will tell you.
The building sits obkročmo at the end of the perimeter with a tower at each corner of the façade, in sight not to be distinguished from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly collapsing.
But once one gets into the curved box, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gateway the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of the Anatolian-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which joined the game of empires late, intended to realize its ambition to dominate the Middle East using this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during World War I.
Their courses were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular troops.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came for Hydarpaša station as well.
In 1917, an explosion of a ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually evolved and history has gone by.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves – at least symbolically – to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
Now a new policy is being implemented – Turkey is engaging.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I took a night train to the Turkish capital Ankara, where I had to meet with one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning — about ten and a half hours later — after a curly ride on the rails that reminded me of the ancient rhythms of the well-known Night Mail document, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, proposed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigms of Turkish consensus.
It has aroused suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP main tent, an ultramodern stone and metal building, deliberately built on an emerging suburb, surrounded by semi-dispersed malls and power stores, where middle managers in business dresses – both men and women – meet to make early morning deals.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I’m sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its territory.
We must look both east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
He had to do both.
“But there will be a time,” I asked, “when will Turkey have to make a decision?”
“Turkey,” he said, “did not want such a decision to take place.”
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke with said almost in memory: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea surroundings are equally beneficial to Europe and the United States as well as to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, go along these rails east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpaša station, after another overnight, I thought of the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched how this building was built a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found out that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the harbour for a ferry back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called “the sick man of Europe.”
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt which continent would be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
As Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (nekrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded an excellent youth choir Proteus a year ago.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but at the time Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 – we simply refused to give up that choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shape converter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to engage in any music that was presented to him - whether madrigales or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often overwhelming, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of that single man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely unchanged all the time.
How often only Tod told us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all in that music.
So sing it!”
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor flowery.
No matter where the music standard was, it always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If any conductor was to be passed on a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well for two decades, when he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
I’ve reviewed more than 100 of his concerts over the past 40 years and I can honestly say I’ve never been disappointed by any of them – and I’ve been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply “traced the world with one or two strawberries.”
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrologist William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at the BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff’s author’s note in Beyond Nab End, but it’s not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as the publication British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino, Faculty of Philosophy
“I recommend Jose Vicente Resina’s “Flamenco and Life” exhibition because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They captivated me with the simplicity and the powerful charge with which they act on the spectators, and with the consideration and respect for the photographers.
A show that shows a lot of things.
Resino can capture magical moments.
Honda to launch its second bestseller
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-space vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is accompanied by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-space car.
These include innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year.
Almost one million units of the Honda Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was the old continent with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to make the new Jazz increase sales in its category.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz cars in 2007, it is estimated that 100,000 cars were sold in 2009, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the automaker de facto expects the year to end with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% decline.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8% from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order to this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
Honda Insight is a compact five-door hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises worldwide sales of approximately 200,000 units a year.
In terms of markets, the Japanese manufacturer estimates that 50% of the Insight will be sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected in the first months of next year, as soon as it will be presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all dimensions.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axle gap to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
In addition, the size of the interior has also been increased.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing a fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment – which has a double bottom system – has also increased to up to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the engine 1.4, as the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements in addition to external features – such as rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glassed panoramic roof – are easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees compared to 67 for the first Jazz.
The second generation of the Honda Jazz also features new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both engines utilize i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower fuel consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings outstanding drive improvements while at the same time delivering high torque in the full range of engines.
The first 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 turns.
This engine – which had 78 horsepower in the previous generation of the Jazz – consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous generation, which was 83 horsepower, the current engine will be 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
“Auto bee” prevents collisions
To advance in the development of accidents-protecting technologies, Nissan is this time inspired by nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the model of flying bees and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress of Nissan Motor Co. developed the robot in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, chief public relations officer for brand technology, research and development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of the four zones of Nissan’s security shield.
The robot is designed to enhance the ability to prevent collisions in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual function, the engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to a distance of two meters in a radius of 180 degrees ahead of the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
“Once an obstacle is detected, the robot imitates bee movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all of the maneuvering is absolutely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
A robot, unlike a bee, cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and the direction that is allowed by the rotation of its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in a bee.
In addition to acceleration and slowing, Nissan also used the rotating function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The device only needs to process information every couple of seconds and maintain itself according to this data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuition from previous manoeuvres, thanks to which it can operate without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but in memory, we’re not talking about giga or mega.”
This is the first step in the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be used in production cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit in the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Enjoy fear before you take a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages at banks with doubtful solvency, he created on the Internet a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel".
It’s not a bad hotel, or a bad hotel.
The hotel and especially its reception looks cloudy to make one think once, twice or three times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not very detailed.
It is more suitable for young people than for the general public.
What happens when the game ends?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because it’s better not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its MUFG capital
Banking house Morgan Stanley announced that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, will enter its center, which will issue $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital.
A week after revealing their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s current shares at a single price of $25.25, representing a total turnover of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG is investing another $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire transaction will take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, lost 6.79 percent to $23.07 around 5 p.m. Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a banking holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, allowing it to diversify its activities, but also placing it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest asses of Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday, among other things, show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for approximately $8.5 billion.
“Even a week ago we thought,” explained Tošihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive, in Tokyo, “that our participation would consist entirely of current shares.
However, given the current situation in the economy and the market, we wanted to reduce the risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less than their book value for Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit on the stock by about 20%.
The agreement presupposes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into current shares within a year if the latter will be exchanged for a period of time at a price 50% above the exchange price, i.e. at approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital MUFG will bring will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, the group’s spokeswoman declined to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said that since the end of August, he has "feasibly" reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has dropped by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs took the opposite trend on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch ransom, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, a Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
To re-establish the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee submitted to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a draft of a new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to the results, 28% of the votes were "No", 7% were void and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it had to get half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted on the east of the polls and a count of NGOs predicted a clear “yes” victory on Sunday, putting them in the range of 63 percent to 70 percent.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday.
“The Constitution has won on all lines,” he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It is obvious that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), took place quietly, concerned the text of 444 points building the “new socialism” promoted by the president.
The draft constitution sanctifies the power of the state over the economy by reserving it the “development planning” of a country that lives primarily from foreign companies’ oil mining and foreign currencies sent by its emigrants.
The proposal, backed by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year terms and will have the option to dissolve the house.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will run for a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution, among other things, reinforces the principle of free healthcare and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts on a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quito to use the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
Egyptian forces have captured 11 tourists and their eight-member escort who were abducted 10 days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were transported alive and healthy to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
In the morning they were liberated in Chad by the Egyptian command.
The hostages arrived around 15:30, apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, adjacent to the international airport in Cairo.
They were immediately transported, without having the opportunity to comment in the press, on board a helicopter to a hospital in Maadi, the marginal residential district of Cairo, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoeyr Garrana said.
Since being captured on September 19 during a safari in a four-wheel drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border officer, director of Aegyptous, the safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the site on board two helicopters, ran off during the night just before dawn.
“There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled,” said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He indicated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the Lightning unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is now, mentioned the role played by secret agents and Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our intelligence services, of the special forces," he said.
He also denied that the ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the attack, the Sudanese army said it had arrested a four-wheel-drive vehicle on board which had the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the Chadian commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to be linked to the Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
The Silent Majority of Culture
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of newspapers with thumbnails and is a topic of the ongoing election campaign.
The Better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still being overlooked.
Who will rise up to sweep out the poor sums that are provided to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national memorial sites that die of hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and its historic buildings?
That in Quebec, just like in Canada, we do not have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is spending three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
For our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in collaboration.
In Quebec, the federation of societies for history of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers associated with 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy strive to uncover history, preserve a bunch of private archives, and preserve archaeological remains for a few little.
Often these companies are the guard dogs of our monuments who, driven by despair, protest when promoters and leaders drop their bulldozers onto old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally be able to see the history and monuments?
Benelux State Part of Bank Fortis
The Benelux countries will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effect of the U.S. mortgage market crisis, by partially nationalizing: the three countries will support the money and insurance institute, which also has capital participation in Hungary, in the amount of 11.2 billion euros.
This was agreed at the highest level this weekend by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to enter a major crisis as a result of the crisis in the international financial markets, which has spread in waves for more than a year, and the decisions made in this regard could in some respects be regarded as precedents.
According to the decision, the three states will buy back half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets.
The bank is sure to sell a portion of its equity stakes, especially the insurance activities it bought last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis stock began to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week serious signs of crisis appeared in the constitution.
But analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to go bankrupt.
The company’s securities fell 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the share price has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given current stock prices, the group’s total market capital value is around €14 billion, but according to the company’s executives, this is unrealistic.
The company’s management blames the fall in Fortis’ shares for overseas uncertainty related to the adoption of a $700 billion U.S. plan.
The shares rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, the new CEO of the bank, Filip Dierckx, was appointed.
The bank was also looking for a private buyer, but no one has made a more serious offer so far.
The Belgian government has already said that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
A fox in a chicken
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people’s data on drug purchases, often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with an applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the chicken to a fox," said Richard Dick, the author of the drug prescription monitoring program.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and amounts paid in case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the applicants, and if the risk is assessed as too great, they will not even conclude insurance with it.
Previously, they sent those concerned for medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of an identification number, a pharmacy customer can easily find out what medicines the person concerned has bought in the past year and a half, from which the program itself deduces what he suffers from the disease and what his health status is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this indicates that he has virtually uncontrollably high levels of blood fats, which immediately puts him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left in addition to paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that any medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, applicable against migraines or heat outbreaks, but are also effective against depression.
These represent a significant risk-increasing factor from the perspective of commercial insurance companies, whereas the first difficulties are not.
For the purpose of collecting and processing data, special companies have been created, which before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, will ask the patient for permission.
They are now forced to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their previous negligence.
Some companies have already processed the results of laboratory tests, which they combine with data on the medicines used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a special law on health data protection, but its effectiveness applies only to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The bill, which will give authorities the power to also control companies specializing in data provision, is in front of Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his program so that the transfer of data is subject to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that he can hardly deny permission, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
The chickens are somewhat dependent on the goodwill of the fox.
Marseille global menu
EU and India double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this theme, along with other, predominantly global issues, was also the top of the agenda of the Ninth Summit.
There will also be a French-India summit on nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognizes that India is a developing democratic power that should be given more opportunity to speak in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to find a common denominator in supporting New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even further discussed at yesterday’s, already ninth, summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current president of the Union, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double trade turnover within five years, or increase to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
As a sign of this, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements on civil aviation with India have been legally reconciled, so that air transport has also been green in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Mr Sarkozy has promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, while New Delhi is ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, respectively, both sides condemned in all its forms and called for an urgent convening of a UN conference.
They also urged the end of the round of trade talks from Doha, although both have a large share in its previous failure.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate agenda, namely that it wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India has also agreed, as well as the need to reach a global agreement at the climate conference next year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would like to prevent rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to analyze the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is scheduled to visit the French capital today to negotiate a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes French firms will be commissioned to build India's nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to the agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Great participation of Italian publishers at the International Book Fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries at this edition, taking up 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honorary guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition area.
It will be followed by a press meeting at the Room Struktur Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production continues to decrease, mainly with regard to literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the desert in Nevada, were found.
The debris was discovered at an altitude of 3,000 meters in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson dispeled doubts that still remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there and now we are sure it's exactly where Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) said hours after the debris was detected, an investigative team was sent to identify the aircraft: it was exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal items were found by one couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett’s name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, about cash and one coat.
The search for Fossett was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on a sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an airball: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, he flew around the world in an airplane without landing.
His many records include flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters over the Andes, though with a copilot.
The Advertising You Didn't Expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined resolute lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk of the "compact" jeeps of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of novelty into this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional design that the communication will be unexpected and unconventional, which will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communicating thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for an automotive brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan’s main business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses that will be distributed near the Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little things, to then again merge into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical area of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to attract future customers in this way?
We know who the Italians are.
From Triveneta, they risk Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following Nazionale azzurra for years and which so far, in truth, has never made exaggerated problems.
She has never met with an opponent.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be recognized.
Inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria found a true Nazi fan, Levsky.
Figc gave Italian fans 144 tickets per match: all on name, so easy to check.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was nobody with the ongoing Dasle, nobody to whom it would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and banned from the match.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the messages coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
In short, our bullies will no longer walk into a single stadium.
for luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more than one hundred and fifty will be added.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not excuse those who behave in this way," Viminal said.
So, "good eyes open, especially because of the national match on Wednesday in Lecce."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count even with one part of Aise, it is a secret service that cares precisely about the problems at the stadiums.
"Chorus Leader-Leader and stretched arms during Mameli's anthem?
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way), who is for a few weeks the director of the Viminal Observatory (he won the place that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously questor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds Observatory One – crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
So far this group has remained within the limits, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistling at Mameli’s anthem: it’s not a crime, but if you allow it, it’s uneducation...”
