Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the top with a light or yellowish underparts.
The find also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called a feather shaft but have other features of feathers - rays and bistrels - the researchers deduced that the feather shaft was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for ornamentation.
The scientists believe that the tail sample from the young dinosaur shows the plumage of an adult individual and not the dun of a chicken.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work performed was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and is made up of lots of tiny particles.
TV reports show white smoke coming from the power plant.
Residents near the plant were warned by local authorities to stay indoors, to turn off air-conditioning and to avoid drinking tap water.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and cause for alarm because of its very high mortality".
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health workers.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire population of people with TB still seems low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are fairly deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stable as large holes on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature around the clock".
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: Voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the voter's identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in the French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can see that the ballot boxes do not contain any ballot papers at the start of the voting and that no ballot papers are added except those which are correctly marked and come from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness all parts of the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki told that the accused met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff Court with murdering his son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be distorted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it certainly seems that journalists should be careful when publishing images of suspects or others".
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be given, at least until the indictment is in hand.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the pre-Six-Day War borders of 1967.
Other topics covered included the reported future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problems of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, whereas the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
The park staff had to monitor closely the shooters in the supplementary pest control experiment as the experiment was being monitored and its effect evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) was sworn in by Martelly yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and causing four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office announced that there were no reports of any casualties in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who was going to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs during the fetal period.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also cheered Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, quite remarkable, like herself, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the various extremes of the poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as these are prohibited during the games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using various hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth was formed since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gibberish and stupidity".
There's been speculation that he might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be provided and the overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities will not be available on the ground.
The fear of missing transportation raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the match behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin's finch Geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided, it can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and set on other metal, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical's pH value, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brintions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made of one proton and one electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system in almost every house.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space requires a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is it's given us much easier and faster modes of transportation.
It has given us the train, the automobile and many other means of transport.
Beneath them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including feral domestic cats) eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
The Huns are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds react much like wolves or dogs in packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete, able to climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion but sounds more like a phrase of squealing, shouting words.
Ocelots prefer small animals, catching monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that they track and find prey by scent, by sniffing out where they have been on the earth.
They have excellent night vision and are very quiet, so they hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then throwing themselves at their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what was previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (ie, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis.
We make our houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is plants, without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would be unable to stand against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-legged man.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their meals while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have large banquets together, where they lay on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of its life outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were open disks facing the street; stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled by few people. In the Norse sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a back, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence of the United States were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one can be sure who wrote it, early in its life the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
So it's likely that the note was merely attached as an addition.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, substantial group of people living together and cooperating, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and it also defines in some way the size of society.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence and equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government  with Congress as the only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no national executive or judicial system, they were dependent on state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all actions.
Nor did it have the right to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The Articles required unanimous acceptance by all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team is, along with Germany's national football team, the second most successful team in the world and became the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "island" from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named the island Ilha Formosa, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change of the original grain production practices, and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastlines and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976 thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reestablished, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most common film size at the end of the analogue era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which may be confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest hero ratio).
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are similar to or close to this image format.
The much-misused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective location for the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was being closely scrutinized.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound together European nations despite their differences in language and customs.
Its all-embracing power affected everyone from king to commoner.
One of the most important Christian doctrines is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was being properly followed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, preventing vital military and civilian supplies from reaching the area.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitudes of most citizens and nations turned toward pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and monstrosities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a collection of poetry and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period or family in power was a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died in the struggle to sit on the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same was true of the military, for instead of rank-based ranking in the army, rank was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life, and he used to visit a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists, because when you're inside the cave, it's a total isolation.
Only the beautiful clear sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the world-famous Great Pyramid being the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-arrow mark resembles a V and the down-arrow mark resembles a staple or a square with the lower side missing.
Up means you start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
As a rule, ups produce a softer sound, while downs produce a louder, more powerful sound.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arrow markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and the bond interest was passed through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the super profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period of time in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that occurred in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that has to do with scientific laws, as well as the way they manifest themselves in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that is hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, the motor car is bound to lead to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
As more people own cars, more accidents occur on the roads, leading to new medical techniques for healing injuries.
Romanticism contained a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic period, geography shaped the individual, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerged that were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because crusaders returned with gifts of silk and spices that were worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of the mother capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of the time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that govern a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their affiliation through an explicit and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children, through neglect, accident or intentional neglect, have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Some child-abuse cases have been caused by the deprivation of liberty by humans (often their own parents); in some cases, this was due to parental rejection of a child's serious intellectual or physical infirmities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others claim to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to the animal that has taken care of the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, staging goes a step further.
The training is not a learning method but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Decks can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of deck, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual workshops are internalised in the software and are designed to question, ask for and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle on their own.
Children come to foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is responsible for providing all the necessities that were not available in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and access.
For example, it is suggested that 'learning' and 'socialisation' are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microimpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added by mutation and removed from the pool of exact variations by selection".
Separation and recombination blends the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of noncompliance: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they're cooked.
Animal foods (ant, termit, egg) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleeping period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing one to get up and recharge the water.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is directly proportional to the amount of tension a person possesses in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and all humans have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the love-story Mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is brought to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the "Deity Yoga", through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in the systems, processes and cultures of the countries led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought in earnest by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while affecting your enemy's ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them, so they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Households were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat herders who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known herders.
As early as the 16th century, wagon roads were built in England.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull heavier loads faster than on the more rugged roads of the day.
Welding was invented early on to keep the spokes in place, but it was eventually realized that spokes would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wagon's wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made entirely of metal were used.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Your predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Two-legged specialisations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms, but if we want to do more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and deactivate them.
Obviously, the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and man's extravagant life-styles.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was performed by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 he read it to his soldiers in New York, and on August 10 a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Most people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
There are many things about birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, for computer language purposes.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too general to be diagnosed immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first-aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term comes from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that live largely as parasites on humans.
Both bed bugs and caterpillars are nestless, meaning that they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having a baby is not the best thing for them or their child.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
Adoption involves the biological parents giving up their parental rights so that another couple can take over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually used in most scientific research.
But it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-driving oscillators that will continue a period of free-flowing cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape and the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplace is the same place they just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system that is based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has untangled the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships are established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road installations.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings into their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the golden eagle and the day-fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
There was a difference of opinion about his theory - some thought he was right, while many thought the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we don't feel the earth rotate, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on earth, and it contains over eight times as much water as the second largest river on earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, with some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing through the planet's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River draws water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long.
Although pyramid building with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their constructional size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City State is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if the right tools are available.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to go near a pencil tip.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The principle behind the fission bomb is that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a little like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, but when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break down under little or no stress.
The moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 kilometers thick on the front and 100 kilometers thick on the back.
It's thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more moon gardens on the front, because the crust here is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is centered around figuring out what makes people respond, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or not to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there are two behaviours that can emerge when a manager starts managing his former colleagues.
This type of leader has a hard time making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's successes and failures.
This behaviour often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same expectations for expertise are set for virtual teams as for conventional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across the functional divisions of an organisation.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
For an organisation to be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organisations to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models with that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves being able to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, having been incorporated into several home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class, and quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where bus travel is not possible.
The technology offers virtual excursions, allowing pupils to see museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a good way to evaluate a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with shoddy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the writer of the blog begins to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written, and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls, and the north is home to Muskoka and other areas of untapped natural beauty.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered genuinely Canadian by outsiders.
Farther north, there are large areas that are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are linked to France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion spread rapidly to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that all female travellers state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is reasonable to wear what may look like a wedding ring (it should just not look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or no, that's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of nips, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu Province.
The city is also a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle-taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 CFA for the short trip.
This, along with the city's relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of threatened World Heritage Sites because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has a more Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and admission fees for the park.
It may also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this gives access to either a selection of South African parks or to all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focal point.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column chart.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon harbour on the opposite side.
The bulk of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated in reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast and into the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List, and the part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/moist areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and robust Japanese buses.
Deletaxies are a quick and pleasant way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 273 feet [83 m] high, the bridge is 1,300 feet [378 m] long, and it has two lanes that are 11 feet [3.5 m] wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world's best polo teams and some of the world's best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, you can inquire with the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed at the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere in the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted within Stanley.
In the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity make it feel colder than what is on the thermometer.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from any other wild animal!
No matter how feeble they may appear, bison, moose, bears, and virtually any large animal can make a good attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they don't keep their distance, but these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly was held in the city, which resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two harbors, and the most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most of them are shaded by the natural pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea.
The most widely used local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
Sure, it's safe to drink the local tap water, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is called an "espresso", cappuccino has lots of cream on top (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the reef year-round, and people rarely get injured on the reef for these reasons.
Always follow the advice of the authorities, read and follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea lice occur near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770, and occasionally outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active lives in the sea, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservations give travellers peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often offer deals at specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping sites.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transport arrangements or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of festival attendees choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be where the action is, you'll have to get in early to get a place near the music.
Remember, even if the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
Check where your cabin is if you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through the ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions), which is good to know, as cruises to St Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in the house.
In some places alcohol is served on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all serious gamblers know the importance of sobriety.
Anyone who must travel over high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On icy and slippery roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive as you normally would on dry asphalt.
In a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to make you stuck.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and slippery conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
For many, safaris are the highlight of their trip and perhaps the biggest attraction for tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to overland trips to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is sufficient to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A bush walk (also called a "walking safari") consists of a series of hikes that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your 2020 flights and accommodations before the postponement was announced, you may be in trouble.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing moist clothing may help to dry it. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed even if there is not one in the room.
If you cannot afford an iron, or if you do not like to wear socks that have been ironed, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to become too hot (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn marks).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests unknown to them at home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit disease.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility of buying goods in designated places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
Beware if you are not used to driving on country roads: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp curves are plentiful.
The speed limits are significantly lower than on routes before and after - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them precisely.
Strangely, the cell phone coverage is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, as in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked into cakes all year round, and cherries and flowers make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you are in the mood for small but filling cakes, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a broad term that covers a wide variety of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, when used without further elaboration, the term typically refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of simple spicy dishes, with the most popular condiments being peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Riding crutches are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot caught in the railing, he may be dragged along if the horse runs away.
First, many riders use riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety buckles that allow the strings to be released from the saddle if they are pulled behind a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a series of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountaintops present absolutely breathtaking views from the tops to all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes amid its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve running down snow-capped terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski buffs" - planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C. show people on skis!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiture, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter of which is performed on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You'll see the ski trail as if it were a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you will be able to cover somewhat more distance than if you walk  but it is very rare that you get the same speed as on long-distance without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can normally cross borders again without having to go through passport control.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are considered antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Livestock is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture around it is also important for many Sámi with other professions.
Traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer in great numbers, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like, and used the reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern trades.
Although the term "Gypsy" is often used especially among non-Romani people, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions are issued in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be shaped by their own citizens.
One example is that American citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often a short-sighted, general and simplified view of the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the general term for all hazardous weather events that can cause damage or serious disruption of society or loss of life.
Extreme weather events can occur worldwide, and there are different types that can occur depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong wind, hail, extreme rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloudbursts and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include snowstorms, avalanches, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions affecting their area as this could affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course" will likely give the address of a local business.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will usually last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment operations abroad should ensure that they bring valid documents with them for their return.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unmarked gender (X), or documents updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies as much.
Security check visits have also become more intrusive in the post-9/11 period.
Transgender passengers who have not had surgery should not expect to come through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the shore, often by a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a fast flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, it's no harder than normal to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or, depending on your skills and if you've been spotted, you might be able to wait for rescue.
Home shock comes more quickly than culture shock (there is not as much of a period of excitement about the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes have a very difficult time adjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in a new country needs to adjust.
People do not necessarily expect patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them silently before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors, but the story of sound and light is like a history book.
The sphinx is set as a backdrop and tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The largest is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where a flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet on the high plateau to form the 200-mile-long (360-km) chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 16,750 feet (4,892 m).
In remote areas without cell service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you must be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including yachts, as well as expeditions requiring remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
One option that is becoming more popular among those planning a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is particularly popular among school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising on their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your sabbatical year can actually improve your chances of obtaining a place in a higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programmes.
Finland is a wonderful destination for sailors. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the islands along the coast.
In the harbors and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, a smaller boat or even a kayak is a different experience.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of days, where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens when flying can help them to overcome a fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Delivery companies charge a lot of money to deliver quickly, and time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they were airlifting, some routes could have taken days to get through customs and clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because the airline rules don't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put up a big pile of money to get the opportunity (or better yet, get your company to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business-class price of economy class and eleven times the price of first class!
In general, there is no need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set their fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the country's second largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and busy commercial city situated on a large bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass facade buildings and the modern shopping centres are surrounded by traditional red brick roofs, the old market from the 18th century and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't tell jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defile the site with markings or by embroidering graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost all can speak Spanish.
Most signs, however, are in Catalan only, since it is the official language of the country.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are given only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you have to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (velopdraget).
The cool exterior of Paris evaporates quickly if you display basic civility.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forested areas - mainly beech and coniferous - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, you will find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, moose, wildcat and bull.
When visiting the monasteries, women are obliged to wear skirts that cover the knees while also covering their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries have headscarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
These can be borrowed from the storage unit at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel entirely safe wearing these skirts.
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a great deal of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any kind of available accessories such as cheese, tuna fish, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always start with a capital, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects
It undoubtedly also makes reading easier, although writing is complicated somewhat by the need to find out whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch are the c and the g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the succeeding vowel.

However, those who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to it that there is no need to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and stand as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on college campuses, where they are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from flowering trees were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around, and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
But when you are in the "high tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to deal with both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
Also, a few buses travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Be sure to check that the bus you are considering taking does go into Hebron, not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian lands and non-Christians around the world have adopted many of the traditions of the holidays.
It is customary to stay awake on Easter night to watch the sunrise in a designated spot.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking out into festivities at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos.
Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the auroras, as the sky will be dark to a greater or lesser degree around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you too can enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by their surnames or job titles.
