Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum, where young people meet today.
A chapel in a tomb, where the subway tunnel is being dug.
Smallholders are farming the former farmland of peasants.
The oldest official map of Munich brings exciting stories to life.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the car navigation system indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road knows this.
The historical maps of the Bavarian Digital Atlas, a service of the Bavarian State Government Geoportal, are far from up-to-date - but very informative for that very reason.
Especially when you compare them to current online maps.
The study will show how cities and towns in the Munich Mercury's distribution area have changed since the 19th century.
The Bavarian Digital Atlas is a patchwork of texts that is not immediately recognized as such.
The large overview map has been supplemented by more detailed maps for towns and municipalities, called urposition sheets.
These were created according to the Bavarian Survey Administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
It was commissioned by Napoleon.
The French general occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph took the project further, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original copy for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison between the past and the present is most striking in the case of the provincial capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example is the Unterendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.
Sendling was incorporated as a borough of Munich 21 years after the map was created, in 1877.
Today, the underbelly is in the middle of the city.
The houses of the Unterendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: a map with dozens of lines and numbers appears in smaller detail: hand-numbered parcels of land from the so-called "collection" from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but by small gardeners from the "Land in Sun" plant.
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, the original tax form not only shows the street name "am Gasteig" or the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at Auerfeldstraße they used to lock up people with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich district insane asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, the psychiatrist associated with the death of King Louis II, ran the institution.
"He was ahead of his time, and ended, for example, the chain of the so-called lunatics.
He also forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates", says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been working with the institution for an exhibition.
Initially, the hospital had a capacity of 280 patients, but this was later increased to 500 patients.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district hospital in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
The former Auer Institute is now the meeting place for young people in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
To the west is the TSV München Ost football field, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's home "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural style of the original building of the insane asylum, which had been destroyed in bombing raids during World War II.
The Marienplatz was recorded around 1856 as "Main Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs in December 1944 tore many holes in the city center.
A large one remains today - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a medieval chapel were once located at the Marienhof, where the preliminary work and the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn main line take place on 5 April 2017.
The sliding control allows the old Munich map to be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is set to take effect by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to exercise extreme caution and caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable race-based incidents have occurred recently throughout the state and are noted here", the group's statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have civil rights violations that people are going through.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed", Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We are hearing complaints at a frequency we have never heard before".
It is the first such warning the organization has issued to a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas on a statewide trip and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's office showing that black motorists are 75 percent more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
"People have to be willing to bring bail money or let relatives know they're traveling across state".
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, which ranks the state 16th in the nation in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that obligated local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The grazing project is elementary
The Fischerbach fence project is a success and will be continued next year.
The CDU MPs Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have been taking a picture of the scene.
The CDU representatives met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members of the House of Representatives at the Schwendemann family court.
Markus Schwendemann first gave us an insight into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, looks after 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and hosts vacationers in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is the only way he can market the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
The only food on the table for holidaymakers is regional.
As he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the grazing fence project as "essentially important".
I can't make a profit on such steep terrain.
The green area is a lot of work, and much of it has to be worked with the motor sense.
"We are dealing with the conditions and the topography", emphasised Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parent holding and operated it without chemical crop protection and fertilisers, even though he did not run an organic holding.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: 'The municipality has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader funding.'
The cost of the scheme is between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this will delay the afforestation of the area for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and who are worried about how to carry on their farms", the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for supporting
The total number of parcels fenced in 2013 was 25, comprising 11 participants.
The area of open space is therefore 40 hectares, which cannot be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was funded through Leader and a quarter was paid by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers with €12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of fence.
"The great advantage is the durability of the fences", explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasised: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and women farmers it is not possible".
Peter Weiß was also convinced that "the best food is produced here".
The Landscape Directive (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg allows state support for grazing fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The conditions for the granting of a grant are that the LPR provides a framework for the granting of the grant.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be tillageable (slope over 35 per cent) and thus threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The total area of the open space is 35 hectares, and the estimated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is there nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The most obvious sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdous Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic ax to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he'd done it.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning that was ascribed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller chided Acosta, "I don't want to get into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the shocking words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich shores".
There has never been a time when the "miserable waste" has been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's America.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is, in fact, a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who were committed to putting her words on the base after her death, knew very well that they were committing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in an outdated classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the Exilets.
The combination of the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great scribe Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame into the night-time world: "Lady Liberty goes on ahead.
It's supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States".
Quite unusual, Limbaugh has stumbled upon something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
Lazarus's great act of fantasy was to see her as she was seen by the tired, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's about, in the truest sense, seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were on the Great Britain team
The UK athletics director, Neil Black, says the 16-man Scottish squad in the World Championships will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that UK athletics need to learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to do so until we figure it out", Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant".
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is rather modest.
"Your captain speech was incredible", says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally was great".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will be competing in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best overall total of athletes at the World Championships to date was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle distance runner Muir leads the way, setting five British and two European records last year.
She will compete in the 1,500 and the 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1,500 metres, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first world championships, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being the team captain is that she was voted by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me", she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes looking to climb podiums.
About my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she did well.
I'm just pointing out that we're very lucky in this situation, because we have a home World Series.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and take advantage of the fact that we're back in Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there".
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand the heat from voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him on everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He was a bit of a bully, I'm sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech may be taken away - and, dumb and silent, we are led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland, where Governor Larry Hogan has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "So what?"
"It's just Facebook", said a lot of people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a vastly democratic state who is incredibly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the running of his state and a strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as his primary means to connect with his constituents, and playfully debuting his hairless post-chemotherapy head on his site.
So blocking people from coming to the governor's site - which is a public forum that is called official and staffed with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that the comment blocking was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people waving whip online.
The Post talked to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not hate-filled, but she did ask about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news", she wrote in the comment section of The Post news show.
"I don't like the idea either, that if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of concerned citizens".
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "speech".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in earlier times, when the same thing would have been done, that staff were sent to collect and burn critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for using Facebook and other social media to insult.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this regard was reached last week in Virginia.
The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's day, the era of the affordable port had an effect similar to the Internet.
Newspaper circulation multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers responded to his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people using the pseudonyms "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't shut her up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a homey at the Renaissance Club.
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the next-door Archerfield Links to the final last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how it has achieved its glory with this event", Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job of setting up this place.
He's a passionate supporter of the game and proud of his accomplishments here.
This is a great showcase for this course".
England's Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It really feels special", said the Southport-based player.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
Memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a truly special time and one we will cherish forever".
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home", said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played solid golf.
I'm glad it worked out".
With the trio on the field is former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.

Less lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died from lung cancer as a result of secondhand smoke.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"We estimate that passive smoking causes 167 lung cancer deaths a year", said Heiko Becher, who led the study.
As a comparison, he drew on his own study on the subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to secondhand smoke.
The new study was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home wiring is proving to be very complex
The construction work on Villingerstraße is well under way and "is somewhat behind schedule", according to the building department's manager Fred Heinze.
The situation in the area of home wiring is more complicated than expected, since there is much hidden underground that is not noted in the plans.
The traffic that keeps obstructing the construction work is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of motorists about red lights and road signs is already enormous", reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite strenuous.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water", says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the chimney.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m"., she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand-picking in front of the occupying forces.
An existing pro-independence movement against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate, and the journey involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a morning five-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transportation.
The city of some 19,000 people is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated tin roofs that have been transformed by rust into various shades of yellow-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, the Papuans of Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, pointing to her vibrant handwoven turban, dark shirt, and light-colored skirt.
"We used to have leaves on our bodies".
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 percent of the population lives below the poverty line and has some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden geese and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s were considered genocide by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything", said a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities in the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week", said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million in the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic trend is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans", explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, to work.
"It has cost the native Papuans - the Mama-Mama [women] of Papua - their market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored", You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols around a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - walking in circles and imitating a bird's song - of the Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heating up, an internal radio command was sent to the soldiers: "If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them dead", states an official document of TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and asked the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist", he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, many shots were fired", he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Yohanes, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told TIME in a somber mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him".
Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Papua Police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings was not filtered to Jakarta until the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical wrongs in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won't happen again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said he was establishing an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the '90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through", he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law", he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with "crimes against humanity" that led to more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with bitter disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress", says Yohanes.
"I'm tired of it".
He says that years later, he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared", he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot".
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me", he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's office.
Police said that villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge", says Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being rushed to the hospital, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days".
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and for the mobile police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is fuelling the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by triggering sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are Paniai natives, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some never show up.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty is what fuels discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat, especially nut and fruits and vegetables.
Farming is the job of the women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten of these cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better-educated and more affluent migrants.
Papua seldom have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation is keeping the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being granted rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denials and a blacklist", he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there is a free media, so it is difficult to suppress evidence in human rights cases".
The people there want more foreign governments to take note.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and crowded "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings", says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuan people, consider their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried in a field directly opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed", Yacobus says, his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire broke out Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 1,100-foot-high, 79-story building.
It's the second fire to sweep through the high-rise, which happens to be called the Torch Tower, in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the blaze.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor", a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said that firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building at around 4am local time (00:00 GMT).
The government said it was working to provide housing for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in exterior areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its 2015 fire revealed that the majority of the damage was from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe that the system of insulation and cladding on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people in June.
No Davis Cup reform: the best-of-five is still the case
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed to win his big Davis Cup at the general assembly.
The meeting in Ho Chi Minh City saw the revolutionary proposal for the sport, to play Davis Cup singles on two-win odds, fall short of the required two-thirds majority.
The five-movement classics, which are often very long but are also highly appreciated for this reason, are thus preserved in the traditional style.
63.54 percent of member countries voted in favour of the reform, narrowly missing the target set by ITF President David Haggerty.
'We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions", said Haggerty.
The Commission will continue to work on improving the application process.
The proposal to hold the final in a neutral venue had been put forward even before the vote, after many objections.
From 2018, only comparatively minor details are new: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round the following year.
To reduce costs for organisers, the requirements for training places, etc. will be eased and players will have to attend fewer official media meetings before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring banned items on airplanes, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while inadvertently carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they discovered too late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to flout the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted to knowingly attempting to fly something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3% admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also admitted to knowingly bringing prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally smuggled contraband through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to smuggle contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were the ones who flew the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what fluids they can take with them or how much of it they can take.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books contraband.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers are canceling their orders
Elon Musk likes to boast about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
The Commission has already been able to verify that some of the customers have withdrawn their non-binding reservations.
In addition to the always triumphant numbers of sales growth and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time in the latest quarterly financial report another, less glamorous number of cancellations for the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk has been promoting the car in recent months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just beginning to ship.
Now Musk admits that of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
If the reservation is cancelled, Tesla will pay back the full €1000 reservation fee.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with ambitious growth targets is not on the demand side, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles to the public.
In 2018, it is expected to be 500,000, all models combined, and 1 million in 2020.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, we're currently adding 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to run its brand new, never-tested production lines without major interruptions at maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent disgruntled customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt is resigning over the delay in Obama-era emissions reduction rules.
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency became more responsive to the needs of state environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his former position in a federal appeals court.
It's about a deadline that expired on October 1st for states to meet the 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the Attorney General of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries have resisted.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply strengthens the EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others to set a deadline for implementation in a settlement", said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have seriously".
However, the EPA's opinion said that Pruitt would eventually use his "delay power and all other powers legally available" to ensure that the regulations were "based on sound policy and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone regulations.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is a significant win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities", Schneiderman said.
New York was joined in this case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources in the atmosphere react with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprise change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to cater to polluters and their special interests".
The 750th anniversary of the church of St. Hilarius in Tumlingen
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm.
The historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay, both for its idyllic location and for the beautiful view of the village.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen have made it their mission to save and preserve the oldest building in the village.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergese record book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen including the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a court of the lord to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people living there, too.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858 shows, the third "berg" was the village's main settlement, along with the sub-village and the upper village, which can still be seen in the village of Tumlingen today.
Old maps from about the year 1600 support these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval right of the Church.
A lord who built, equipped and staffed a church with a pastor remained the owner of that church and could inherit that church as well.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to suggest a new one to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two was destroyed on Christmas Day 1673.
The new bell was first rung in 1692, but later had to be surrendered in 1942 during World War II.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were smashed and the bell-shapes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They took out the pulpit and the chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve, 1834, a storm split the church tower in two and half of it collapsed.
To prevent a misfortune, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf survived to this day as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Selfish Retirees" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As the organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilary Chapel on Sunday, July 16.
The project is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The final word is from the village head Hartmut Romann.
The program will begin at 4:30 p.m.
Check-in is at 3:30.
The serenade ends with a drinking ceremony outside the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over the meadows to the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The serenade is only held in dry weather.
The organizers hope to have many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for the deaf and hard of hearing.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to take care of their homes, as confirmed by Walter Martini, the organizer of the Serenade.
The Association wants to have wind turbines approved
"Boisheim is resisting" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association 'Boisheim Wehrt Sich' (Boisheim Defends Itself) has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of wind power plants planned in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed on the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
The zones are designed to prevent the "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier to set up a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer grid by amending the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved this zone because of a clerical error.
"The lack of planning law prerequisites means that the permit issued is still illegal and therefore to be withdrawn", said Christoph Erkens, chairman of Boisheim Verte sich.
The city council has decided to re-concentrate the wind power area in the Boisheimer net before the summer break, pending approval from the district government.
Erkens: "This excludes the possibility of granting planning permission for the construction of wind turbines".
The circuit confirms the incoming call.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen Circle since last week", explained a spokesman.
The circle is taking this as an opportunity to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the termination of the proceedings.
The district decided not to comment on the arguments of the association "Boisheim wehrt sich" on Thursday, given the proceedings before the Administrative Court.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four windmills of 200 metres each on a site on the Boisheim network.
Last year, the company, in which the City of Viersen has an indirect holding, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the site, which covers approximately 65 hectares.
The four wind turbines are expected to meet the electricity needs of some 11 400 households - about one fifth of the electricity needs of all households in the Fourth Republic.
NEW Re is looking to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Viersens city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collide: Woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The country road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich was driving the L 333 towards Bogel in her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekend
In September, the city centre is set to be a new shopping destination for the residents of Bad Langen and the surrounding area.
The trade union and the city administration want to use the weekend of 8 and 9 September to lure residents to the city centre for shopping.
The chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced that the "home shopping" weekend was designed to make customers aware of what their own city has to offer, apart from the usual supermarket goods.
The plan is to set up a market with regional vendors, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local firms are asked to present their training places.
In addition, the downtown shops are to be invited to the "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
The Commission is also preparing a new programme for the European Union's new Member States, which will be launched in the spring.
The city and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The trade association and the city are thus entering the next stage of the project "Attrctive Downtown".
These include new activities such as the first "Active Day" at the well festival, including the open Sunday, and discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive Saturday offers and the elimination of parking fees on Saturday are also part of the concept.
In addition, the aim is to develop new or renewed customer opportunities.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the downtown shopping area, too.
In the end, everyone would have to help to bring the city centre to life - including landlords, the city's businesses and associations.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment is based on the principle of proportionality.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that for the first time five Thuringian towns will participate in the third "Heimat-Shoppen" day in the whole of Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day is designed to "promote the appreciation of local commerce and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", said Streich.
The action, led by the IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
Nine more people were injured.
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis has killed two people and injured nine others, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, one of the injured was in critical condition on Wednesday.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the blast.
A missing person was later found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
Authorities suspected the accident was caused by work on a gas line.
During the holiday season, very few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall, according to leaked phone records
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on the phone to ask him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly telling him, "You can't say that to the press".
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a deal for the US to take in refugees who had emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous", "fuzzy" and "stupid", and that to stick to the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like an "asshole" after he proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the day".
Moores Ford massacre: Activists reenact racist lynching as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a crowd of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rammed its way onto the Ford Bridge at Moore.
Before the car, with four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long puff of his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were terrified.
"We want this n--r Roger!" roared the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene played on July 22 is only a reenactment.
But then when a noose was thrown around "Roger"'s neck, almost everyone in the audience let out a very real sigh.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night that two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged for the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are", said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the retreat.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls".
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and is an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice", he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we have justice".
A forensic pathologist lays a bed sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties have been suspected in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the lynchings has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer primary.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said the word in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then as they were moving away from the prison and approaching Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison was the one who planned and ordered the murders", concludes an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, "who not only participated in the killings, but also suppressed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre", he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community, 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual reenactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant, and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look at, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'll be confronted with the ugliness of it in all of us", she said.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or hear what I've been through".
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - huddled in a room and listened as Greene began a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He's been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that", Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive, because we don't want to go back to those times".
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, the horse, screaming and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona is returning fire.
There's a break.
And then everybody (at least all the black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too harsh?
"No", said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'he' back then".
"But", one of the other black actors quipped.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'".
And that's when the energy shifts in the room, and a sense of camaraderie replaces the uneasiness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not just for the game, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
No one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's screaming, there's shooting, and then there's silence.
A woman dressed in a funeral dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, came to see the show, many just coming down the street.
They've all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have been an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunting.
As the song's final notes are played, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children are bowing their heads, registering the fake blood and the still bodies, and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead", murmurs a little boy, as if trying to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the Clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then collapses in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him.
"It's okay", one of the women whispers.
"We know this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason".
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are excitedly chatting about their after-hours with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to describe the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you", she said.
"What really makes me think that the lynching is still going on", she added, "today it's just called police shooting".
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks is courting at his table, eating and reminding of civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning the show for next year.
"The reenactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning", he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
"Whoever does not study his own history, whoever does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it".
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerian in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also uses a colorful, frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner with Berlin's Mauerrest and Dönerbude, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
There's an open-top Mercedes vintage car parked in front of the Rhine girls posing as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked barrels of oil evoke Castorfs central theme - money, power and greed - which runs through his "Ring" production.
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood style, drags a dead body into the trunk and gives the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the delightfully evil Hagen, surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene where he beats Siegfried to death.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a loud round of applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated with a storm, who is modest and bends his hands to the Merkel-route.
The orchestra of the festival is applauded for its first appearance on the stage - in casual clothes again in the face of the great heat.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly awaited.
In 2013, he had to miss a gelling whistle concert, but five years later there was a great celebration in which the isolated "Buh" calls were drowned.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been delighted.
"You can see that the audience has in some way grown together with the 'Ring'", she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made some kind of peace with Castor, but also had grown to understand his point of view.
I will sum up on a positive note.
Max Menge is a volunteer
They work in several places at once during their volunteer year.
Where?
Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've also worked full-time at the school.
What's your experience with this?
It's a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.
I deal with all kinds of people, with adolescents, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late call volunteer.
Why is that?
I graduated high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully dropped out.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Do a social year, there's a glimpse, you can see what it's like on the spot, in the spotlight, maybe, really.
And was it?
Crowd: I've collected some great impressions.
I'm going to start my social work degree this winter.
I will study dual studies, probably do social work training at the youth office in Herne and study at the university of applied sciences in Hamm.
Isn't it a little unusual to have multiple different types of assignments during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it all depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from the nursing home to youth work - in all sorts of social work.
I had a lot of variety.
I also did some OGS, which is afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what turned me on.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Different from civil engineering?
So, clearly, this is not about calculating statistics.
You keep thinking about different people, each with a different story.
Whether it is a refugee or a young person who has been taken away from his family, it is always necessary to deal with it individually.
That's very interesting.
And you were not afraid of touch?
I'm not the type.
It's a field that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are some negative moments, but that's life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive the business
Britain's education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as it launched another restructuring program to overcome the pressures the company is facing.
The job cuts announced by CEO John Fallon, mostly for late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already seen the loss of 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May, in a third cost-cutting program, a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after posting a 1 per cent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carrying improvised explosive device".
The statement said that all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilian casualties were reported in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the country's military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay an Obama administration regulation that requires states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue and that we respond to our government partners", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone regulations - which are designed to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - for a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will boost economic growth.
But the effort has been met with resistance from Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the public health impact of higher emissions.
The EPA website says that breathing air containing ozone can "reduce lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The local council wants community space
The decision was clear: the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to create a community centre in the future retirement home.
The sale of the remaining part of the land has been signed, according to Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take some time before the parish will be able to use the land that has previously belonged to the parish, there is no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be financed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area.
One of the two investors still on the boat has offered to help the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area of some 180 square feet [55 sq m] and an adjoining terrace of some 230 square feet [70 sq m] for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the local council are planning to provide such a community space not as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior housing, but openly into the community.
For example, the word "strip café" was in the air.
The decision to allocate funds to the current budget, which was already taken last autumn, is being sweetened by means of subsidies.
The building is in the redevelopment zone.
The establishment of a common area would, Tjaden reports, be eligible at 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to make a decision on the subject of the use of the term 'sandwich' in the context of the 'sandwich' of the 'sandwich' in the context of the 'sandwich' of the 'sandwich' of the 'sandwich' of the 'sandwich'.
The need for this addition is not only expressed by Wilfried Sohmer.
If it helps, he's unanimously passed the board.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Referring to the many private buildings that are not very well maintained, Daniela says: "I'm having a hard time with this".
Yvonne Staiger is definitely in favour of the community space - but is absolutely against local government involvement.
It is a subsidy to wealthy people or even to outside investors.
This is not the case, because the purchase of land does not give a subsidy, but gives a real countervalue, which is doubtlessly marketable, the counterargument is.
Staiger's request to split the motion for a resolution accordingly has three co-sponsors.
The Commission has already taken the initiative of introducing a new system of taxation, which will be introduced in the Member States in the course of the next few years.
Collision with car: Cyclist thrown onto road
A 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
Police said that the 82-year-old Langenfelder was riding his bicycle on the cycle path of the street Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 am.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A female driver of a car traveling in the same direction gave him priority.
But when the Longfelder drove onto the road, he apparently paid no attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was thrown into the street.
He was seriously injured and taken to a hospital by ambulance.
Bayern Munich have to give up David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup will be held without him: David Alaba must skip the game against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first home game of the new season.
Seven professionals missing the defending champion in the Super Cup against the Cup winner.
The staff worries at German football record champions Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 ZDF and Eurosport) at Cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti will have to do without David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed it on Friday.
The Munich players are also missing: Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the last six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical shape", said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important thing is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good the last time".
The 58-year-old believes he can improve his performance in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will display these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play smartly", said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German heavyweights is drawing fans into its spell.
The game was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
♪ Walking in the resin from star to star ♪
The first "star path" in Germany is to be created in the resin.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" would meet the information needs of many visitors to Harz, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
Members want to put up signs along the planned route, informing about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
The question is whether the Commission is prepared to take a decision on the matter.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented by the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile reception is important when choosing a location.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council by 31 December.
Later, the Star Path will be expanded by train.
"The path of the stars teaches the viewer much about the physics of individual stars", the association said.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines brighter than another even though it is much farther away.
The constellation in which a particular star is located and when it is best seen will also be indicated.
Since 2014, the association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be seen clearly with the naked eye.
Since 2003, the University of Göttingen has been hosting something similar to the planned star cluster - the planetary path - on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet-degraded Pluto at the end - are precisely spaced out and on a scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, standing exactly 75 meters away, is still only 70 centimeters long.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While it takes about eight hours for light to travel from the sun to Pluto, it takes a good hour for pedestrians to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Featherweight Champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck".
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight", Garcia recalled.
"I've gotten up for browners [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that tall.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to lightweight.
And he's got to move to lightweights [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this".
Lomachenko was in agreement.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to set a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could be in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for it", Garcia said, later openly expressing his desire to fight at the network that offers the best financing package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you 're ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped short of the lavish praise for Garcia, saying that he thought the three-time champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus was on showing off the punch, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be fought.
No other fight has generated so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight".
Four injured after a flat tire
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4:30 p.m. just before the Marketbreit junction, probably after a flat tire.
The car swerved to the right into the bush, where it swerved and then crashed onto the roof in the green.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident.
During the emergency services' first aid operation, the A7 northbound was closed for about an hour, after which traffic in the left lane could be diverted past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-way chains work better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2-2 draw against Braunschweig, the optimisation of the defensive formation will bring points to Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result, too, if the two goals against Braunschweig had not been 2-2.
"We have to be more careful in Aue", says the defender from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The three-way chain in the Ore Mountains is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick is not what fortunes want to catch.
"For the future, it will be that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)".
Hoffmann is convinced that his team, having also had experience in preparation, will cope better with the three-way chain than with the four-way chain.
"I don't know yet how we will play in Aue", says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident in his decision, "because we have players in the three-way tie at the halfway positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well", said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and that we do not make so many mistakes in the set-up".
Of course, Hoffmann goes to Aue to win the game.
"But I don't know if you can call a draw a bad start.
The performance could be okay", said Hoffmann.
"But if we can finish with four points on Sunday and concentrate on the Cup, we can certainly talk about a decent start to the season".
His coach wouldn't listen to him.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play", said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early because of bad weather.
"Now they can start the season with a home game", Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, since they do not have a serious and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favourite in the bones.
"But they don't know where they are at 100 percent", says Fortuna's center.
The guests from the Rhineland are the easy favourites to go to the meeting in the (almost) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday.
"We're sweeping them away just because we have the right to be in the top six, it's nonsense", says Funkel, whose record against Aue is quite positive with only one defeat in nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start", explains Fortunas's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and conceited".
And that's not how Funkel wants his players to play on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden who underwent a new method of medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over the age of 18, but not everyone believes the results are accurate.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They are intended to improve the accuracy of age assessment during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "likely to be under 18 years of age".
The tests are only done in cases where the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent for the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics from the past months, the numbers are pretty consistent", he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest the person being tested was 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that's the kind of measurement that should be used.
It's very uncertain to judge biological age in this way.
If we cannot say for sure, we should not pretend we can", he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in which case it is about 10 per cent".
Full on .
Work on the three bridges on the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well under way.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it is going super", says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Office in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that were in need of repair.
The construction is scheduled to be completed in October, and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arch bridge, covered with red sandstone, with a total length of 16 feet (4.8 m).
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has grown old.
To ensure the stability and safety of the road, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They're made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of the town of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tonnes heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a rim brace that is also used as a working road.
A bridge cap of 2.20 metres wide is to be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path will follow.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the Lauterbach structure required a special touch of the fingers.
Because there's a fiber-optic cable that connects many companies.
The residents were informed about the project in advance by means of leaflets.
The first thing to be done was to remove the fish and crabs.
The traffic on the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg is controlled by a single traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance.
The total cost of the three bridge repairs is EUR 700 000.
It's all state-funded.
AfD in Gerolstein: Riot at German potato salad
It is not often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it is difficult to get together otherwise.
The parties represented in the Volkaneifel district (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully shows the flag on this day, because the AfD invites the Gerolsteiner town hall in Rondell to the "great election campaign act" according to the poster.
The European Parliament is also taking part in the debate on the future of the European Union.
But those who are there hours before the event, do not want to listen to the AfD, but demonstrate.
The motto is "The Eifel stays colourful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Fountain Square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that's here.
And Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the One World Forum and one of the main organisers, is delighted: "It's great to see so many people gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including "a German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, and they are present especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had made an effort to organize such an event and was given the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked for a car in Daun, but was refused because there were not enough parking spaces available because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So, Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event in Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good people's right, as long as it remains peaceful".
The Commission has already taken the initiative in this respect, and I am sure that it will be very helpful to the Council to take the initiative in this area.
In the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the speeches of the leading candidate for the Bundestag elections, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
Police presence is unchanged, but so far, officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little over an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but there too, the clean-up is due shortly after 9 pm.
The police can leave without incident.
Trumpet meets trumpet
There's a series of Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German formation with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is the solo trumpeter of the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the soloist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both are united by the desire not only to cross the borders of their instruments, but also to merge the borders of the different genres.
The two of them sound like Johann Sebastian Bach in a new outfit, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" is united with Bulgarian folklore, and in the "Exchange Suite" by the Jazz Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing are mixed into a fascinating work of art.
This core element of the programme was first staged in Freiburg this spring with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach Monastery Church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart speaks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything", Kristen Stewart says quite openly about her bisexuality.
"If I ever bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?' "
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, which ended bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress told Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I was faking it?"
After their split, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it's never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously".
She said that she suffered from this especially during her school days, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11, the kids told me I looked like a kid.
I really felt attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'"
She is especially reluctant to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that bothers me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public".
The governor of West Virginia announces that he's switching parties
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would be switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me", Governor Justice said.
"Today I'm going to tell you with much prayer and much reflection... "that I'm going to tell you as a resident of West Virginia,
The rally erupted into cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans", Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game".
Mr. Trump promised to make a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes says is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's party change is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again".
"With only 15 governments and the least amount of legislative control in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message", RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's chief athletics official, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as Russia's blatant apology for a doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be reinstated in sports.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all the athletes who have been robbed of gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very honest presentation", IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re-shape".
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re-engage Russia", Coe said.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we want to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players under the strict IAAF criteria at the World Championships in Athletics, which begin in London on Friday.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-hiring.
'Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still operating freely,' he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning for soldiers killed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1000 people paid tribute to the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral under heavy security.
The cause of the crash, which is still unknown, was not disclosed by the Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU).
She called the two pilots who died "experts in their field".
"We bow before this supreme sacrifice that they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany", she declared.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from North Hesse died a week ago on Wednesday in the West African country of Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr brought to the Fritzler Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the family members left the church.
After that, the funeral ceremony began with the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
The German government has also been accused of using the "German" language in the media to promote the "German" language.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
Outside the church, Fritzlers and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the soldiers killed as "highly decorated" and "highly skilled".
The staff captain had helped to establish the Tiger helicopter operations in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, likewise stated: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, no one could have".
The European Union is not the only one to be concerned about the situation in Mali.
But it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states", she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
The Bundeswehr did not provide any information on when and where they would be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn 't want to be buried next to his wife .
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe, 77, Prince Henrik, 83, does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family announced this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard had already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement continued.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he has no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a mockery of his unhappiness with his title.
He would have liked to become king after his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972.
In 2016 he retired and also relinquishes the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and position he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equal to his wife - even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
The final resting place of the 83-year-old is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French aristocrat, he had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the French Embassy on the Thames.
While his later wife was always the object of popular sympathy, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his nearly 50-year regency.
In an autobiography, Henrik says about his first years in Denmark: "A few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluid, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knit socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country as the brand of sociocritical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed of it.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
The German government has not yet announced the date on which it will hold the elections.
Because he spoke out on Friday in favour of dissolving Parliament.
The surprising resignation of a Green MEP from her Lower Saxony parliamentary group had previously plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the elections to the Landtag, the red-green coalition lost its narrow majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and FDP in Hanover.
The former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move by not nominating for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU", she said in Hanover on Friday.
The CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his group to accept it.
The CDU and FDP would thus have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on a regular basis on 14 January next year.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the implementation of the new directive on the protection of the health of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decides as soon as possible to dissolve itself.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next course of action on Tuesday afternoon.
The constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag to withdraw the Prime Minister's confidence and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution provides several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally", said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in a calm manner, once they have been properly examined".
Thümler called Twest's move "a little curious, though".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She described herself as a supporter of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the defector to give up her seat in the Landtag.
"We naturally assume that she will immediately relinquish her parliamentary mandate, which she obtained through the green list", said the chairmen of the Land, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Green Group leader Anja Piel said: 'We are extremely sorry for the decision taken by Elke Twesten.'
The Commission has made a conscious decision not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the absence of any differences in content, we cannot reconstruct this step".
The German Chancellor's candidate, Martin Schulz, has condemned the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP, Elke Twesten, to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green party", wrote the leader of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
The Commission has also been asked to consider the possibility of a new directive on the protection of the environment.
The withdrawal of Twest costs the Red-Green majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician "places her personal interests before the welfare of the country in her wounded vanity and frustration", SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil criticised.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is playing along with this dirty game of intrigue and trying to make political capital out of it".
The CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MPs that they accept Elke Twesten into the CDU.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force in front of the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a slim majority of one vote in the Landtag.
- How do we protect ourselves from poisoned eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could this scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
The Minister for Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), is interviewed by the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) for a speech and answer.
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself against poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in their refrigerator and to check the pressure in the bottles.
The consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de provides the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Although, according to all we know at present, a health hazard is practically out of the question.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food control is the responsibility of the Länder.
Nevertheless, my House immediately took action and has been in close contact with the authorities in the countries concerned since the fact that Germany was affected became known.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are fit for use and safe for human health.
Eggs which have reached the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg are considered unfit for human consumption.
However, unfermented eggs may be sold and consumed.
This time it's not the companies' fault.
Are producers and consumers in the same boat?
According to the present state of knowledge, the production enterprises are not directly responsible.
Rather, they are faced with economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few controllers in an emergency.
Is it only the lack of staff or is it also the lack of a coherent authority?
It was the official controls that uncovered the incident.
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated 100 percent.
The Commission's proposal is to introduce a new system of taxation for the benefit of the taxpayers, which would be based on the principle of the taxpayer's right to be paid by the taxpayer.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full clarification from the authorities responsible.
Is regular alarmism about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The fact that the measure has been withdrawn has put manufacturers, dealers and consumers in a situation which is absolutely unnecessary.
The principle must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be tackled consistently and vigorously at all levels.
I expect all the authorities concerned to clarify the matter promptly and completely.
How the Financial Laws of Football Affect Neymar 's Move to Paris
The rules, which are designed to prevent European football clubs from spending money unimpeded, will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France.
Some consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money to sign Neymar and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations to the Council and the European Parliament on the subject of the future of the Community's football.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs which had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking going broke if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - was going to become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can incur losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini fell from grace in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to push for a disincentive to overspend.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely be tightening the rules for the future", Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can spread the amount for billing over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee for the next five years of € 44.4 million can be shown in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest penalties along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €20 million - and ordered to keep the squad membership for the 2014-15 Champions League at 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart its financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be World Cup ambassador and such a move could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million in 2015/16 with a turnover of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best soccer players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish daily AS in reference to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country".
Swiss is looking for a new supplier of shoes
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has been making chocolate bars for the Swiss.
Now the sweet partnership is facing a possible end: the airline is re-tendering the order.
The Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper Nordwestschweiz on Friday, at the request of the sda news agency.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey", the spokeswoman said.
Each year, flight attendants hand out some 17 million small, red-and-white, 14-gram-sized Schoggitaboxes to passengers before they land.
The Swiss did not want to give any details about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume for Northwest Switzerland at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is more important: for a shoe maker it is a prestigious job.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are for the new tender.
However, only Swiss producers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
The largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros' daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had supplied the chocolate tablets.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago when it started its cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, Business Class passengers are spoiled by Schoggi from Lindt, and Economy Class passengers are spoiled by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also served by Chocolat Frey in both business and economy class.
The winner of the discus throw at the Olympics, Robert Harting, reached the final of the World Championships in athletics.
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic champion, had failed to qualify for the national championship and could only watch the discus-fight from the grandstand.
Also with the first attempt, Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia is going to the nitty-gritty in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective".
This re-telling of the story is both nostalgic for the characters' glory days in the 1980s, for the 1990s grunge era (when pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" did surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they still managed to make it impossible to recapture the last bit of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more of a watering can, including a riff on the 1990s stalker films such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now being supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-crafted impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the field trips are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon's under-lip from "Singles", whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old fart.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a sort of recurring "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I think is its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the gang attending the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now a reminder of a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde", and even "GLOW" with its East versus West ringing iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a tough-minded Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'Find the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays as one.
Six long episodes, it's dragging on, and the comedy isn't fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a shorter length, could better deliver his agitatory satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything into food for a guelage.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we are even doing it with our own younger history and with theirs.
Fight against drug mafia in the country
The police have dealt a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
Fifteen accused, aged between 25 and 77, have been arrested and warrants have been issued for their arrest.
In addition, officials seized large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy in simultaneous raids.
There were German warrants against the two Italian suspects.
The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.
The operation involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
Over 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the Prosecutor's Office of Constance has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the Prosecutor's Offices in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
The large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was therefore accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigation targeted Italian nationals with close links to the Italian mafia.
The gang may also be responsible for an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a report on the implementation of the new rules.
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to one report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
The Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to major gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners, according to a media report.
The lack of data could lead to "some serious misjudgments" in asylum procedures and deportations, warns Weise in an analysis published in the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The register reportedly contains ten million persons with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreigners' offices in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In some cases, the data were found from 1921, "from people who have long since died, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not have appeared in the register".
"Errors in data input can significantly slow down returns", the report continues.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the EU also include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such mismatches, however, led to "a distorted debate on the treatment of those subject to the obligation to leave", the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently started to send refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they arrive from there.
This is the conclusion of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper states that BAMF will "re-introduce such procedures in respect of families with children, with the exception of infants and young children, to Italy as of 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically impossible, the newspaper said, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Convention, the EU country that reaches the first EU country is responsible for the asylum seekers.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
The Office now states: "In the meantime, the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially".
The Italian authorities had provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back under the Dublin Agreement.
The German Bundestag's Left Party spokeswoman, Ulla Jelpke, criticised the decision: "Families with children are facing conditions of reception that are contrary to human rights and a threat to the welfare of the child because of the shortcomings of the Italian asylum system".
Second best result achieved
The blood donation service has already provided a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach for other people.
At least, of the 12 citizens who were honored on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who has now donated 100 litres of blood, is the first to do so.
Traditionally, the community honors the multiple willingness to donate blood at the town council meeting.
"It's great how our bodies are designed to do this, and we have to respect the donors who donate their blood for strangers, and who don't do it for their own benefit", said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One blood donation helps several people", explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the German Red Cross (DRC) branch, since the preserved blood is broken down into its components.
For one, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the activities being carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we had the second-best number of donors, 114", said the DRC district coordinator.
Obviously, the change to the theatre a few years ago led to higher attendance.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the many donors who were recognized for their 50 donations.
Half as many were given by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave off 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce interest rates unchanged later, as weak economic growth and a slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" as it maintained interest rates on household income amid mounting pressure.
The policy makers on the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members pushing for an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank lowered its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate increases would be necessary in the next few years to rein in Brexit-fueled inflation, and she said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - at £115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on household real incomes continues to weigh on consumption".
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some monetary tightening" would be needed to cool inflation and to a "slightly greater" extent than the markets expected.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that the increases would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank's downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the forecasts for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
It maintained its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision is unchanged after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The recent inflation report offered little encouragement to households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases, as the tightening will get worse first before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy "cannot prevent the income collapse" in the next few years, but added that wages would "clearly" recover by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU vote that caused the pound to plunge.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to reach this level.
The Bank's latest interest rate ruling was preceded by calls for a rate hike as inflation increased pressure on budgetary strains, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6% although the Bank said this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "wholly" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: 'The recent decline in swap rates should make the mortgage market more competitive again as lenders are looking for deals and want to end the year on a positive note.
The market is particularly good for those who are expiring existing deals and taking out new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular".
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment in the NHS from September, following a fight in the High Court against funding the drug.
NHS England has announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the NHS in an initial three-year study involving an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a High Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as "an important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "defining moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, with more clinics to follow in October before it is rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there is just enough medicine in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day for up to two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics will identify suitable participants to consent to the study, including men, women, transgender persons and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a GP can also register for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is being used, taken up and implemented in a targeted way on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention was intended to complement and overtake the widespread and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges".
Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: "This is a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted to people who are vulnerable and in need, has the potential to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement".
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to get the trial across the country quickly and to ensure that no one is left behind who is at risk of HIV.
Now that PrEP is available, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are infected with HIV".
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant government implementation.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be done as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us to come one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'
Living the big life: mid-rise and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room", says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day".
Since the first inspection, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room apartment with a sloped layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request", she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi to use the 12.5 foot ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling wasn't big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand in.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the puzzle.
"The steelwork is quite complicated", he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over.
The idea was not to build a simple platform, but to position the steel at the right height for the function above or below".
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with much added drama.
The second floor has a classic Retrouvius copper light window that looks down on the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By making the room feel more glamorous, the beauty of the living room can shut off the kitchen when it's not being used.
Folding kitchens are not new.
The special thing about this one is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it", explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, laminated MDF door.
"It's counterbalanced, so that when you push the door up, it slides very easily".
Through clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the land - or how your property is valued", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land".
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home", says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
They're important, but they don't play with your heart".
It shows that through good design and increased square footage, an apartment can go from something standard to something truly amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave it.
Brothers fighting over a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a battle over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the High Court to have their property and business assets divided.
Paul has been wanting to retire from the family business since 2014, but a heated debate over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul about one-third.
A court record says that this means Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul owns property worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
"Colin's proposed divisions left him with what I thought were the best objects", he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him from.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of being incompetent in managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority", he wrote.
The costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms owned by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, where Colin opened the family's first denim store.
says that he started Westco Colin there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons in peace.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court", she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis corporate group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "became bitter over the terms of their financial separation".
Colin has been very reserved, despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin texted back to say, "I really can't say much", because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to take our family name to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote a letter to the court saying that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current quarrel", he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution".
On Friday, that hope seemed to have died.
"Our case will be decided in the near future by the courts", Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he is, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the chief on a more evenly-tracked course.
Here's a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first day in office, he identified a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wants to fix: bad information that has fallen into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should be flowing - whether it's on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information".
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from places that were convincing", former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos' Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit in check, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes consistent praise".
I'll take care of it.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel if they hadn't intervened.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his associates have managed to keep him out of trouble on a few occasions, their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently stopped Trump from stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House that is made up of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - which is busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of advisors to give the president dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is keen to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or for not offering concrete evidence or for making false accusations in the past and then retracting them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh".
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives".
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the public is asked and hoped to assist.
This summer, police officers across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of wanted criminals are not known, the public is asked for information.
Europol reported on Friday on the action which follows the 'EU Most Wanted' advent calendar of the winter.
The EU has also been active in the fight against terrorism, and has been active in the fight against organised crime.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to indications after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a trench and return to the 'millionaire's row'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are at war with some determined travellers who have negotiated a trench dug by the community to reclaim a field outside their manor houses.
The travelers parked their 20 trailers in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called "Millionaire Row".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters with them after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the Council to prevent their entry.
The discreet group found a gap in the defense system and squeezed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way out.
Angry residents have been pressing the Solihull Council, which has said it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced by shame to act, since it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, moved on, and now they're back.
More arrived last night, probably more today".
She added: 'Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long sessions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the council can't even stop it".
A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen in the park".
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police to take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider when we present our case".
From Birkenhof to the Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is now the Waldhotel Luise.
The house outside Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is due to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
The hotel was closed on 13 April 2014 by Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH, which at the time was responsible for the management of the hotel, and the hotel lost around 30 000 overnight stays per year.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which caused controversies.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the town council at the time.
But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and spoke about serious interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group, headed by Birgit Scherer, with its headquarters in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star plus-category hotel again under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has long been lined with construction waste containers and the extensive renovation work is evident as you enter the building.
The floors were torn out, the ceilings were partly removed, the old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There's a lot to do before March.
"It's actually a nice hotel", says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the matter.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it".
The facilities include a swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room.
The Commission's proposal is to set up a European network of information centres for the hotel industry.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, is designed to be spacious, Scherer explains.
The hotel is designed to make individual, group and business travellers feel at home.
He had already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line".
Asked about the amount of the investment, Thomas Scherer did not want to be specific.
Just under a million euros, he figures.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought up to the front, as is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Joy town is a good market".
Russia case: US special investigator uses grand jury
In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has been working in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that the board's initial subpoenas have already been issued in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow.
The investigation is focused on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican presidential candidate during the campaign.
Mueller was also reportedly increasingly scrutinizing Trump's private and business circles.
The Washington Post reported a few weeks ago that Special Counsel Trump had personally traveled to the center to investigate allegations that the president may have obstructed justice in the affair.
The main function of grand juries is to examine evidence in potential criminal cases and decide whether to prosecute.
Grand Juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually called in on larger and more controversial cases.
The proceedings are always conducted behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called upon by the public prosecutor's office to summon persons for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued regarding the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report said that persons involved in the meeting had been asked to give evidence.
They should also provide documentation.
Trump Jr. was joined by Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his then-campaign manager, Paul Manafort.
Legal experts said on US television Thursday night that the move shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he is willing to act quickly if necessary.
But it doesn't necessarily mean that the grand jury is going to be called in at the end to decide whether to charge him.
The Commissioner also stressed that the Commission's role in the fight against terrorism was to provide a framework for the implementation of the EU's policy on terrorism.
Amidst the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication", said Trump.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he was unaware of the grand jury's decision.
The Commission is also proposing to make a further increase in the number of Member States that have already adopted the directive.
The White House was in favor of any measures that would expedite the Special Counsel's work in a "fair" manner.
Former FBI director James Comey said three times that the president is not under investigation.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed, the statement added.
But Mueller had only been brought in after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outburst, accusations against Trump had been raised, that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey testified in June to a Senate committee that Trump asked him to suspend the investigation into then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House was collecting material against the special investigator and his staff.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump would want to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional investigator, as in the Watergate affair of the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller is in a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the urging of the President.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills Thursday that would make it impossible for the special counsel to be fired.
Antarctica: A giant iceberg is floating in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg nearly seven times the size of Berlin has broken free of the ice sheet.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing over a billion tons and measuring 2,800 square miles [5,800 sq km], is now drifting northward and will probably take two or three years to melt.
At 110 miles [175 km] long and up to 30 miles [50 km] wide, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
He's not a threat to humans.
The extent to which climate change played a role in the iceberg's collapse is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for some 30 years, according to a fact sheet from the National Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC).
Many researchers believe that this may be related to global warming.
The colossus, now broken off, was once part of the Larsen C ice shelf.
Ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
So it keeps growing into the sea and breaking off regularly.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf is located south of South America, almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The balance of growth and decline was disturbed a few years ago north of this ice shelf.
A complete ice sheet has collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
The ice sheet is also under stress and could break if a piece breaks off at a key location.
The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels, since they float on water and ice displaces as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of ice sheet allows glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to drain away much faster than before.
This could raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, says the British Antarctic Observation Project (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in the Antarctic, according to AWI, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks off regularly there.
"Although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position", said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the United Kingdom.
"This is the largest retreat since records began", he said.
"There is a lot of controversy among scientists about whether the Larsen C ice shelf is going to grow back or whether it is going to retreat and possibly collapse in the long term", said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, a great number of ice shells on the Antarctic Peninsula have been broken up in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches out toward South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has lost 28,000 square kilometres of ice since the 1950s.
The decline was due to the rise in temperature.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the regions with the fastest temperature increases.
CDU wants to pay staff for their housing
The CDU is calling for the union to withdraw in order to make itself more attractive, as it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies.
Just before the summer break, the county has signed off on 41 new administrative positions.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 more trainees have completed their first day of work.
The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously in high demand.
Applications for the posts to be filled this year were around 620.
However, the district still lacks the staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present there are still 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
The job is for doctors, engineers and general staff.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in the district council, together with the FDP and the UWG, and to address the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to 'develop a recruitment and development strategy' as requested by the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term skills needs but to address the shortage of applicants in a forward-looking way.
The overall approach should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for the new entrants and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good start.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not so known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the creation of a European network of public employment services.
In addition, a large number of staff members are leaving the service because of illness or old age.
So it is high time to act, so that no more posts are left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU, and his party are going beyond the joint motion.
He recently surprised the whole district by publicly questioning the cost of staff and confounding the other parties.
Völker wants all the possibilities for leaving the local employers' association to be examined.
"If we cannot find a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should work with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns in the district - to achieve a flat rate", says Völker.
The CDU is thus trying to pay its employees and officials better than the public service wage bill actually provides.
The current system of salary increases is strictly regulated, and increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is based on years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees had to deal with the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and the district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy toughening the tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work", said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on the detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can't assess all the allegations that are being made until we have all the information and can assess the situation".
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Youth Rescue boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking on board migrant lifeboats that are delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such encounter allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the Code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were deemed unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "substantial changes or impediments" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue operations had decreased sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and work with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel", the Minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rising and Trials
Nine Weiler bikers, the Berliner Außenposten and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Then came the viewpoints, some on towers, that looked far beyond the Pfälzerwald and the plains that lay ahead.
In between, there were longer climbs, rewarded by long trials.
On the second day, we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the outlook was lined up with a line of "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many more high-altitude flights were scheduled.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins, and huts provided welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhale curative salt in the open air inhalation.
Neustadt was also hit.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of elevation, the group had seen the Palatine Forest at its best - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is gearing up for e-sports
Will sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of sweating their way across the stadium grass in the wind and the weather?
The fact is, esports has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans, and huge tournaments with huge crowds.
This has been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs to become increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was made by VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope that this will inspire a whole new group of young people to join the VfB", says Jochen Röttgermann, the VfB's executive director.
He is sure that "a number of clubs will be taking this train".
Next weekend, the world soccer federation FIFA will host the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have also qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now a consultant for an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future", says the 52-year-old.
And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could have a much larger online presence in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What is it exactly?
E-sports involves playing computer games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter-Strike and the football simulation FIFA.
As in normal sports, leagues have long been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly something to get used to.
Ingo Froböse also took a long time to consider the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many of the biological and physical reactions that you find in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and quick reaction.
Professional gamers should not only exercise their bodies at the console, but also pay attention to their diet.
"The fit player is a good player".
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue".
The Commission has also found that the online games are not as well-controlled as the traditional sports games, and that the scene lacks the structures of classical sports.
The scientist stresses the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are international, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the consultancy firm Deloitte and the Interactive Entertainment Software Association (BIU) predicts that e-sports will grow rapidly.
In 2016, this led to the turnover of EUR 50 million in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover should be 130 million.
This is a small amount compared with the Bundesliga's budget of almost 2.4 billion euros.
However, the Deloitte consultants write that e-sports "are not far removed from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey".
Internationally, many countries have already advanced.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are part of the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher has invested in esports betting company Unikrn.
Europe is also doing something.
The European Union is also committed to the development of a European sporting culture.
In the Netherlands and France, Dutt says, the Premier League clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"Germany is lagging behind in European comparison", explains VfB's executive board member Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to simply fall back on nostalgia and to dismiss the old days.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to orient the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world", says Dutt.
"You can't just insist that football is the only game that stays the way it was".
Poisoned eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
The scandal over poisoned eggs has now affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and withdrew all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of texts that incited Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is in distress.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, hands folded and eyes downward as she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not taken responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets".
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said he had not found that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness significantly influenced her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said that "there is not a day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain, which we will carry with us for eternity".
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"To no longer have this one person with whom I have been together every day since I was born is a pain that I will carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case gained national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before he killed himself, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad", and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention from Roy's death and ordered that she be profited by some press coverage of the case.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison".
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-footballer at FC Bayern
It's no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was named captain of the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern are hoping for a great season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different about his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup, he took the tie that was allotted to him.
"The coach didn't announce it", the Confederation Cup winner said after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the one-off could have gone better than the 0-2 against SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also be interpreted that way.
Arturo Vidal, eight years older than Vidal, was not chosen as the leader of the C-Elf, which consisted of young players, debutants and professionals who had just returned from vacation.
Sugar is best distributed to those who are trusted and who want to keep a good mood.
So whoever's chosen to inherit Lahm's estate could use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed, "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old was running across the field as a mini-calf.
Right back, that's his position now, the white ribbon on his arm did the rest.
And Kimmich, in this starting lineup, seemed to be the one who could handle the rudder best.
He was giving orders, trying to steer the untrained troop.
He had the eye for the big picture while many others were preoccupied with themselves.
Vidal to make up for his lack of fitness (barely folded); Renato Sanches to, for the hell of it, make up for the achievements of the Asian tour (also folded only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not stand out in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
At least it worked out.
Sule ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy up against the defence, both acting sovereign.
The Napoli-Sturm team, which was well known, often struggled, and Süle also tried to build up a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not what we had hoped for".
But he, too, made a decent debut.
Change of pace, change of pace, "I was hired for this style".
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers, was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements behind his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
"You have to win every game with Bayern".
At least he doesn't have to teach the new ones that.
Alaba is motivated by the ÖFB-Ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our women
Austria's most famous footballer tweeted just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian Legionnaire is a clubmate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feverish with our ladies.
The tweet from the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational spray.
The famous Bavarian Dusel might be useful to our ladies.
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises the pace of the industry
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in office of the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Volker Wissing (FDP).
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and the Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trie Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing is catching up to the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked".
The biggest change for Natus is in infrastructure policy: the lock on motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
The Ministry hopes to have a planning process in place this year, and the building permit should be ready by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is an essential part of the Federal Road Plan, also plays a role in the plans for the country.
The aim is to open the line in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a way forward to support regional but internationally competitive businesses.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, is striving for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of declining German wine exports for ten years.
The IHK also said Wissing was open to people who wanted to start their own company.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees the new "Meister Bonus" as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says its managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
The award is worth EUR 1000 for passing the master's examination and EUR 2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master's degree.
The list of homework assignments for the country is long.
The planned road construction is a fast-paced process, but the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, general manager of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing intends to recruit to the state company Mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, member of the CDU parliamentary group, refers to the Court of Auditors' calculations that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
The Commission also expects a national concept of how it intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The Commission's proposal is to be implemented by the end of the year.
The Commission notes that the regional authorities have not provided any evidence that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
They complained about slow internet connections and disconnections.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she left after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to switch 850,000 diesel vehicles - car makers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as recalls.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrous oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing systems to neutralise the emissions from diesel vehicles is also increasing for car manufacturers, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called switching off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but backed up under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was implicated in a German criminal investigation at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could place a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message was carried on the Saturday on the Isar.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To ensure that the visitors to the Isar can join in, a raft will be sailing through Munich tomorrow morning with a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you'll see a big raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a typical raft with Isar tourists.
The building committee wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large infographic.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to visitors to Isar.
The theme "True Love is"... is intended to raise awareness of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection.
The float was already on the Isar last summer and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Murdoil's nose and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, and the cartoon noses of his characters are his trademark.
The Argentine still draws at 85 and is working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 in Buenos Aires, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his early years as an artist, he worked as a greeting card artist, among other things, which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job", he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough in the late 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Time and again, the artist drew inspiration from cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures tumble over drawings of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London, and Red Square in Moscow.
He still sits at the drawing table in the early morning, according to his own account, working almost ten hours a day.
His funny figures continue to be widely distributed throughout the world, using calendars, puzzles, books for adults and children, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches.
He has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's favorite animal in his drawings - who is pitted against a centipede.
His characters will speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is set to hit theaters in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me", Mordillo says.
He's not writing the script.
So he's more likely to go for the TV series, which, like his original sketches, is produced wordlessly.
The lavender of Provence is threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is in decline because of droughtlike conditions and disease-carrying insects, which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: 'The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an effect on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cycads, a microbe that transmits dwarf cycads, and in very dry weather there are many of them".
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only popular with vacationers, but it is also in demand in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil".
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective clay-water mixture and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The small town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhône is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Shopkeepers, guilds, merchants, vagabonds or a country slave camp are to be experienced in the city center on these days.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for covering the recent chaos in Sinaloa State caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists are discussing which feels safer: to take their children, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, to the office or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: Enemies, Neutrals, Allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no end to the violence, and while the country is piling up bodies, more and more journalists are joining in: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the Riodoce building's facade, two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecution was established in 2010 to handle cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders each year linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop", he says.
"Until we know why, we distrust everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men, forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, every day, someone or several people are shot in the street, or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug lords, larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt over not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons, was published.
This publication may have angered the Sons, as suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Northwest in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 of his stake.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without coming across the drug problem", Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigative stories without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories no one else dared cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexico's drug history wherever it led.
He freely admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live", he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"You have to do the job that comes with being a journalist - either that or play dumb.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you tell us what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-loving bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and sit at the same table there.
Now they ask, was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you to deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed", Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happens".
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where Riodoce employees were meeting for security training suddenly had no cell phones, and days earlier it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were seeking shelter from the 104 degrees (40 C) heat in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Partly in jest, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountainous country where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state expenditures, focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite haunt of drug dealers and law enforcement.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost a century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column the best-informed source on the abduction.
"We would have known what happened before", said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken".
The Valdez office has become a repository for signs and stickers protesting the murder of journalists, rededicated because the staff have become something they never expected to be: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the DA's office the next morning to join a demonstration against another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, it's his.
Across the country, journalists have raised their voices by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they were telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks last year to police and civil servants.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut", Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for my reports".
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of its correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those of us who stay behind and continue to work, it's a daily dance of risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter", he said.
At midnight last Friday, after the final edition had been finished, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office drinking beer, when suddenly all their phones began to ring.
A series of shootings involving rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb, they posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were heard nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who stood guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing", Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to cover it".
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although a frightening one.
Now, researchers have discovered that the first findings of an incredible rhinoceros from a Canadian miner were so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even tell that its scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said it had had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while digging in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He came upon something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100-kg) lump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be unveiled.
"If you blink your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe it was asleep", said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
"It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better with its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Now researchers have studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over its body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, since boreal opelta far exceed the size of animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was being chased by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter shading -- think of deer, zebras, or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable to predation, which signals that this Nodosaurus was in a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been", said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was carried out to the sea, where it sank backwards to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans were likely much farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal", said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it, if you squint a little, you could almost believe he's asleep".
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, flesh-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
Among these was the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster that stood 38 feet long and weighed six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was submerged in the sea and mummified in the mud after death.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds.
It contained two 20-inch-long spikes protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that the armored herbivore was swimming through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover hollow armor plates along the dinosaur's body.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that support the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers spread upward.
I can count the shells on his sole.
In the storm: mass carnival on the A8: Many injured
A major accident on the A8 on Thursday evening: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car wreck.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured in a mass car accident late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, about 5 p.m., during a thunderstorm, about 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, were crushed between the connecting points of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district).
The exact number of injured was not known at first.
The injuries were minor to moderate, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene.
The A8 towards Munich has been completely blocked.
In the direction of Munich, a roadblock of about ten kilometers in length formed.
An AZ reporter reports that there were also massive obstructions on the opposite side of the road - caused by numerous gaffers.
The fire department recorded the license plates of the drivers of the vehicles, who now face heavy penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
The accident involved a car-carrier and a passenger car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene.
German railway company tries 'comfort check-in'
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced: sitting on a train and sleeping, not knowing anything.
Or you're just so wrapped up in your work that you're having a brilliant idea.
And then, puff.
The driver comes in and wakes you up in the middle of nowhere or rips the passenger right out of the workflow.
Check your tickets.
But the days of interruption are soon over.
The German railways are currently testing the unmanned ticket control system.
You just confirm on your phone that you've taken your seat and then you devalue the ticket.
A test run is currently underway on two routes.
"If the offer comes, we'll extend it.
It is expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany early next year", said a rail spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is what the railroad calls the driverless ticketing process.
However, to use them, you must meet certain requirements: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked a ticket online - which most passengers do anyway.
You also have to have bought it through the train app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book a ticket anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because this is how the comfort check-in works: you get on the train, you look up your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test clients will then have a button for electronic evaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket control station in the Y section, he knows that there is a passenger with an invalidated online ticket.
So you can go on sleeping, working, keeping quiet.
The 'check-in' has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn is intended to benefit the passenger.
"If you want to travel without having to check your ticket with our train crew, just check in to the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their journey on the train more personal", says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director at DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our staff have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Anyone who travels by train knows that ticketing is one of the biggest annoyances, along with delays and missed trains.
Because often you yourself, but in every case one of the passengers, do not have all the documents you need to evaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card is missing or the ID card or some other document that you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking one's own ticket and, in the end, takes the driver's time to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
The Commission has also decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 108 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the aid scheme for the construction of the runway at Dortmund.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet available.
How one activist learned the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Am Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he is still lying in the street", it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street and would stay there for four hours.
"This is wild", Ferrell thought.
But death was not new to them and their community.
She hung up her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were pictures of the police band and people screaming, and a man claiming to be Brown's father wearing a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another officer unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... all animals".
"That's not common", Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to seeing and can call typical".
At that moment, I felt a shiver.
I was angry and I cried".
She booked a flight back and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, told from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, the two men discussed a conversation they had had countless times before that morning about the black experience and the black condition.
"Remember how I taught you that black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her", Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is the culmination of what happened in the past.
She has to know it and see it and be brought up in it.
It has to be well developed, not just activism and organization, but also knowing the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we have to do to be free, to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't experience blatant racism in person, she's no different than the next black female child.
I feel that I would be doing her a disservice by keeping her away from it".
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place across from the police station that became a campsite as the activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to distribute them to protesters.
A new kind of activism was slowly taking shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely after 9/11, " she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food equity and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come".
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, were just trying to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document it or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
And this skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often white people, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, and he, along with six other locals, followed the Whose Streets? team in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone speaking for us or speaking to us. We are speaking", Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed".
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not about a messiah-leader, but about a community coming together", Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most outspoken participant.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets? reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love and marries his wife.
"I felt like I was naked", said Ferrell, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I've come to understand that in this work and in humanizing black people, there has to be a certain vulnerability".
In addition, Ferrell's story echoes the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who made the film "BlacklivesMatter" a social media phenomenon after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall", Ferrell said, "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to carry the brunt of it all".
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really being sustained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who stirred up this energy", she said.
"It's no coincidence that she was on the front lines, "because there's so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen".
Now, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the racial ties between the community and the police are still there.
Ferrell is on probation for two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home: "A chaos".
But she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains".
From "dream" to "gig mania": TV readers discuss the bit gallery
The Bit Gallery is moving people, even though it's not even built yet.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject is hardly left untouched.
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While they tell you about the Bit Gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "No one needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Big mania!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents of the idea of a gallery attracting more customers to the city, which would benefit other businesses, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
The gallery is planned to be located on the same site as the farmers' market hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
Once the construction starts, it will be over.
The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping at the Bauernmarkthalle almost every week for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women, always very much.
We also discovered the butcher shop.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the gallery has been built.
Other cities have them, too.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting".
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers in a market hall settle in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But it's not going to be low on the new project".
What are you doing in a shopping mall in Bitburg?
Whether it's clothes, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets, I find it superfluous.
There's plenty of that in our town.
You can see how many stores have been empty - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall be preserved.
After all, the products offered there are fresh, are mainly supplied directly by the producer and are also cheap.
As you can see, only large companies rent out shops in a shopping center, where the retailers often cannot afford the rent.
It's a pity, specialty shops are almost gone, and what's left of them will probably be gone".
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall is not a good fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit with Bitburg.
First of all, where should the farmers' market hall go during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even permanently, if the Bit-Gallery actually comes.
Or is the ghost of Bit-Galerie already running all the shops out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This is not going to work.
And a shopping center that's empty is not for anyone.
I think it would have been better to have a real farmers' market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farmers' market hall, thanks to the insane number of - as I find it - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear".
A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, you can see many faces -- white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike -- hanging from cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clips from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic cables through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and seminal dissident whose conviction was overturned by Barack Obama when he was just three days into office.
Dewey-Hagborg, by algorithmically analyzing the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data -- the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations -- but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six counts of violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
The prison had suppressed her image so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable sitting in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the heels of the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That's when she got an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time, and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that foresaw a future in which President Chelsea would reverse her judgment and be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually, just days after the book was published, call for Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome sort of happy reunion.
There's something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump wages a war against government informants and transgender troops to find new, two-pronged ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to be fixing.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all of this, she said, "Things happen for a reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature below it (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence -- a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped that by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon) she would show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What I hope people take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open to interpretation genetic data is and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work Spurious Memories is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories".
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned comic novel.
It shows Manning emerging from the United States' disciplinary prisons like King Kong with a public address system in her hand.
"If they can put you down, they've won", they say.
"So never shut your mouth".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me", said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"It still gives me goose bumps to talk about it".
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra, who will converge like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5' 2", Manning's height), where their genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation".
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were issued arrest warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County District Court records.
The files say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after multiple stabs.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem is now on leave and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the appropriate authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation", said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to assist the US investigating authorities in any way possible".
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he is urging the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were in a relationship", Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
'At a certain stage of meeting the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect", Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the Code, which sets out the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the criteria in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, authorised by WADA, into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist".
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In a conversation with Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov attributed past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
The EU has also been working to develop a common European approach to the problem of drug trafficking.
RUSADA was suspended from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be re-engaged.
Aldi is not selling any more eggs for the time being.
This was reported by the business groups.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should be able to adopt a directive on the protection of the environment in the event of accidents.
From now on, only eggs that have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-noise agents may be supplied to Aldi.
Aldi wanted to make it clear and transparent to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
Often, answers were vague, unhelpful, or, worse, deceptive.
And even with your promise of anonymity, some workers don't trust the process.
"There was just never any consistency and objectivity", said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called outside people for help.
A new breed of human resources start-up is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by businesses to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap polls and surveys from specific teams, it provides a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down to see why.
Companies are coming to see that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harassment environment where those who spoke were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire for a snapshot is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps businesses prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge of interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber miscredit scandal.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed on as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send out tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text message hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, complaints go directly to the board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can face costly consequences through consumer boycott, worker layoffs and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email address for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues that were previously hidden by executives in city or state offices, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices, can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience", said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation".
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until "social media got its way" for companies to realize that they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge the companies recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capitalists who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There's a growing body of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work they do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get returns when their portfolio companies are doing well, and companies are doing well when their employees are engaged and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you're finding support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or at all, it can breed disillusionment and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, president of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on data collection.
"For if you do not follow, the staff will wonder, 'Did you really hear me?
Will you take care of it?
And if you don't care, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action the same day a problem was reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to use the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly gaining new insights about its employees, and hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better retention of employees in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people", said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you're going to lose business.
The NCAA is eliminating the two-day practices and making it a long day for the Bruins.
It's approaching 11 p.m., as a crowd of UCLA football players converse on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have their jersey covers off and their backs are covered in sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good portion of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players who have signed up for the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice session before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
"It's a real grind for the boys over the next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day practices to ease the burden on the players, and they've actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three practices of UCLA were to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day, as the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and held practice for the first time during summer school during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They're scheduled to do 18 practice sessions throughout August, 20 before the start of formal game preparation for their opening day against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous load on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging", Mora said.
"And they just went through with it, they just kept going, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great".
UCLA will be ending its internships once the camp is finished, which, given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-end hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that cleared a safety net from behind a goalpost, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are scheduled to be booked into the hotel this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there might be a problem once these rooms become available during the season.
"We will use our security", Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people would rent a room there and then set out to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security there, and we have security in lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan".
Facebook to step up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake news articles to third-party fact-checkers and then display the results below the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday, as part of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may display the fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being inundated with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts like those before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a trial of the new fact-checking will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share", said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "connected article" feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle has featured in a squeeze music video and was a safe haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has lived through 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-headed Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years", he says sorrowfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand".
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by a different up-and-coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: he wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins", he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, people would light a fire to get the light.
To someone 300 years later, the smell has the effect of being present.
I love the archives!"
For someone so wrapped up in old papers, being supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and living in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overestimated my welcome a bit"), all this seems too good to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives, and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyenas' heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he drank whiskey and started writing.
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff had just begun to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years where aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You'd think land conflicts would be boring", says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families were fighting over.
Boys, let it all out!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot which occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The DarreIIs are Rhodes's favourite family from Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, always going into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys with a talent for recruiting heiresses".
After his time at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again", he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with my fucking life again".
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Chapel of Mary in Rhöndorf concealed
The city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof mark (Thursday's Round-Up) on Friday with the unveiling of the 301-year-old St Mary's Chapel in Rhöndorf.
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team, led by Nelson Artz, have decided to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday.
The campaign will culminate in a festival on the island of Grafenwerth at the end of August.
"Too good for us.
Or are the people behind the action asking the same question on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday?
"We don't really think that (of course)", they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
"But we're using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
We are firmly convinced that as citizens of Bad Honnefer we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city".
The campaign is about more than just a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is necessary to formulate a unique promise, one that will give the city a distinctive and unique characteristic".
It is, after all, in competition with other municipalities.
The average five-digit amount allows the city of Bad Honnef to afford its new brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year, at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara meets to discuss retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So is this week.
At first glance, it seems to be a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it had been in the past, but in the Prime Minister's official residence.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions, chaired by the Prime Minister.
That left the YAS with a large number of civilians.
The government is taking control of the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly for alleged links to the movement of exiled leader Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people who are believed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being tried in Ankara this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already called the coup attempt a "gift from God" as it gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Discomfort in the Military Headquarters".
The General Staff is concerned about the increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The sweeping clean-up of the army and security forces is continuing.
In mid-July, Erdogan dismissed by decree another 7,395 civil servants, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
Generals used to be considered the real masters of the land.
Three times they staged coups, citing their role as guardians of worldly government.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually reduced the power of the military, not least by citing the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing an Islamization of the armed forces.
In Vocal Europe magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad for fear of persecution after the coup attempt warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO indifferent.
However, after the purges, there are doubts in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The EU's leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened", say NATO diplomats.
Washington is changing the rules for the green card.
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It includes a reduction in legal immigration to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries".
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy", Trump said, as quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for raceway shuttle
The future of the Rennsteigshuttle has been the subject of much debate in recent months - now it is supposed to be done quickly.
The railway line, which is in ruins, is to be built before the end of the year.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race-stop, construction work on the track is to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and rehabilitate the Ilmenau race track, the country is committing itself to this important link, especially for tourism", said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the line was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this, the country will pay 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered from the land in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and Südthüringen Bahn as operator had already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the timeframe, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated", said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The goal is to have the Rennsteig-Shuttle regularly ordered by December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is especially popular with tourists.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has been carried out to test whether the line is used by enough people to be used regularly in the future.
The track is also heavily dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought 2017 couldn't get any crazier, a new report on the technological advancements in sex robots is coming.
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its nipple shape, and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we're going to see it a lot more", Mr Sharkey said when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with silicone skin that feels warm -- with conscious human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing anything from the color of the robot's eyes to the shape of its nipples to the type or color of its fingernails.
But it gets even more disturbing because many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to customize their robots to fit the characteristics they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", who gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy", with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as close to your personality as possible", the True Companion website boasts.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation, or she may be "in the mood"!
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots -- not least because they are replacing real human relationships -- but the submissive female qualities, the references to rape, when you step one step closer to Frigid (meaning reluctant) Farrah, are what most trouble one.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will not, of course, keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times in which we live.
And a lot of people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to be.
There's a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are coming at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world, when there's a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the swallowed bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to real women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, to cut a long story short, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
You can't just break up with your date or walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are willing slaves.
Or to put it in the parlance of 2017, "Maid".
Trump's great accomplishment?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It's become a Trump-era truism that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided families in the small business sector.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, newspapers in the United States were running with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We're all supposedly working our asses off to blow our filter bubbles.
Less noted has been Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relatives she'd fought for decades over politics, are suddenly and strangely on the same side.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
The left has been empowered by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about normalization and Trump, we're referring to the scary possibility that one day we won't be repelled by his antics.
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of sanity by his standards.
I find myself today gripped by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, indeed seem like very mild offenses.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate will only need to be mentally sound to qualify as immeasurably better.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fibreglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals are twisting to look over their own shoulders in fear - are extremely dark, and the clicking music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés about a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not really a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big traffic circle in North London.
But the Central Park carousel is still a weirdly magical experience, because two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can ride it and have a great time.
If I could have rated Karussell, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, I was forced to rate my "experience" in transactions on a one-to-five-star scale at a department store this week before I could use my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the appraisal with a 15% tip - this is to buy something over the counter.
Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood there with a sorry grin as I was tired of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius is in hospital with chest pains
Pistorius has left prison for a second visit to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which prison officials say he suffered after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after a prosecutors' appeal against a first-degree manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her repeatedly through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Crime Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg , he 's going to have to go to the zoo .
The last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-grade pupils from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed for the holidays and for secondary education.
Three of the dismissed pupils will go on to secondary school, four to a comprehensive school.
On Tuesday evening, school principal Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and members of the public to the Biesental House in Epfenhofen.
The 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle as a symbol of school leaving.
The cheerful crowd also performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Hen House".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken egg, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, the third and fourth grades in Yvonne Frank's classroom showed a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young goosers, who carried cylinders to the stake.
The eagle is for integration, said school headmistress Angelika Sitte.
The young are different from the other young (chickens), but they are part of the group.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
He said his destiny was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader would feel accepted in their new school.
The participants were then thanked by their colleagues, the former headteacher Michael Müller, who often takes over the teaching duties, and the parents' representatives.
"The time for hatching is over", explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She said that she was reluctant to let her students go after two years of school because it had been a really great time.
She said she could finally count on the fourth graders.
In conclusion, all the students sang a song about summertime and the holiday season.
The children were delighted.
Eight first-year students have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, as quoted by television.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of illegal migrants, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released the same day, and an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are imposing substantial fines on anyone found staying in a place not designed for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in a nutshell.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
The aim is to improve the emissions of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 cars.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives his opinion:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the software updates that we've negotiated are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software", says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Agency (KBA) has ordered them to be retrofitted.
How and when are customers informed of updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given a specific date.
Daimler said to write to everyone involved.
If an inspection is required, it will be carried out within the framework of the inspection.
How long will the rearmament process take?
"It's hard to say", said Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"We have seen that the car manufacturers have not yet taken any voluntary action on the environment".
How long do you think the update will take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists do who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises waiting.
Foreign manufacturers would probably follow, Smetanin said.
Is there a threat of a massive price drop for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But in regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas there are no losses in value for older diesels.
The ACE is advising to wait to sell.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the prizewinners won't come - in protest.
LL Cool J, 49, becomes the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center's coveted awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's honorees include singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be handed out in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the award ceremony along with his wife Melania.
The winner of the award, Lear, who became famous for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not attend the gala.
He told the New York Times, "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withhold funds from them - and that weighs on me".
Estefan, 59, said she would use the call with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural facility in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city planner, is retiring next year.
The vacancy has already been advertised, but suitable candidates are scarce.
Wacker's been a city planner for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work, as he says in the press conference.
He reports on the varied but demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
The Commission has therefore decided to make the necessary adjustments to the present system.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have appropriate qualifications.
Because the city is determined to keep this function.
If it were no longer able to fill them, the citizens would have to travel as far as Offenburg to take part in the consultation.
But he is concerned about the city and himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working environment and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We're making the city livable", he says of the construction company and its employees.
But there are also various projects on the agenda for the future: the redevelopment of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, has been started.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will fetch around 1.5 million euros "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
It's fun working here".
The Commission's proposal was to create a European network of urban centres.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, Vieles could be responded to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot", says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors alike.
The old town as a whole is a protected monument, so it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city planner stresses.
The city's master builder bears a great responsibility.
He's a builder, "everything ends up on my desk".
He has long-standing staff to provide guidance and coordination: Markus Neumaier (building) has been with the company for ten years, and Manfred Schöner (groundwork) for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay".
Continuity is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further development of the city.
According to the information provided by the city of Haslach, anyone wishing to succeed Roland Wacker should have completed a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of building planning and building planning law.
The Stadtbauamt is responsible for civil engineering, building management, land development, administration of urban properties, the urban farm with farm and urban gardening, and the Lower Building Authority including protection of historical monuments.
Bicycle thrown on tracks: Southbound track closed
According to the police, the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
The damage was so severe that the approaching goods had to be stopped.
Investigators believe two males are responsible for the crime and have been looking for them since the early hours of the morning.
Near the scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle.
"This is far more than a joke", said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would have endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of the replacement railway, the offenders could also be penalised by railway customers.
The total was 'considerable', he said.
The damage was repaired by Friday afternoon, and the southern railway line was able to run without any obstruction.
Almost ten passenger trains had been cancelled by Friday morning, two of them long-distance trains.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were damaged as well.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help to reduce IBD
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects some 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are typically advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes lurking in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of causing inflammation are counterbalanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan -- one of the building blocks of protein -- to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment if the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference was related to the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's intestines were sequenced for DNA, and they found six types of bacteria that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing in the mice without them.
So, mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they didn't develop that type of immune cell, and they got L. reuteri and the immune cells were formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active ingredient was cleared from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop in human cells as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population.'
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed Nemanja Matic as a "genius", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40m signing from Chelsea started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid kicks off on Tuesday, and impressed in the holders' role as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched on at will.
However, Matic was ruled out of the Blues' pre-season tour of Asia, and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho conceded he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football", Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later".
Along with Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new signings, but insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that", he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort".
The Boeing "malt" Dreamliner is in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots took off from Seattle, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and traveled across the United States in the form of a Dreamliner, thousands of miles away.
The operation lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had done this kind of advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
We have a problem here.
The wind is turning: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked with a certain concern to Berlin before elections.
The most important wish of the campaigners was that there should be no interference from the party headquarters, and that there should be no opposition from the Bund.
Since Martin Schulz has been in charge, it's changed.
Since then, the Willy Brandt House staff have been watching with growing horror the events in the SPD-ruled provincial capitals.
What Schulz has been getting since the beginning of the year, with a headwind, wouldn't even be described in the introduction.
It was a low.
One by one.
The CDU sees the surprise end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: the Red-Green Party simply cannot govern reliably", CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise exit of a Green MEP from the parliamentary group has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the elections to the Landtag, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and FDP.
The Greens' chief executive Michael Kellner has called on the renegade Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to resign.
The transition to the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
The German government has already announced that it will not accept any new proposals to the EU.
"This can't all be true", sighs an SPD campaigner as the new job message arrives at the party headquarters on Friday morning.
The Commission has also been asked to provide information on the progress of the negotiations on the accession of the new Member States to the European Union.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in the SPD's national associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, that's all. The comrades of his time were reassured.
After the elections to the Landtags of Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, things will be different.
And then it did - and it got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel sent the SPD into a tailspin, and the Düsseldorf riot killed the party.
The comrades worked hard to get back on their feet in the weeks that followed.
Then, just as they were getting their courage up, the G-20 came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in the crisis communications after that, he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now we have Stephan Weil.
The VW Abgas affair and his role on the supervisory board have long been the subject of criticism.
Bad polling figures were added.
In spite of this, or perhaps precisely because of this, in recent weeks Weil has been trying to put more and more emphasis on the Bund.
The former mayor of Hanover's desire to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the circle of Martin Schulz.
They allowed it because they promised von Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
The fact that the Lower Saxony Greens are involved in the internal party dispute is not really the fault of Weil.
And Schulz is not one of them.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their ranks together.
The Commission has already taken a number of steps to ensure that the Community's financial resources are used to achieve the objectives of the Single Act.
'It is intolerable and damaging to democracy that Ms Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,' says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party's left wing in the SPD parliamentary group, the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives in this area, including the creation of a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (ECVET) and the establishment of a European Centre for Vocational Training (ECVET).
The logical consequence would be for her to give up her mandate.
The SPD's leader, Thomas Oppermann, has called the move "undemocratic".
"The will of the voters was clear four years ago: the people elected Stephan Weil as prime minister", Oppermann, who is leading the Lower Saxony SPD as the front-runner in the federal election, told the RND.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to improve the quality of the information it receives from the public.
He demanded that the background be clarified.
I want to know whether there was more or whether the CDU Lower Saxony made further commitments.
Support for the local level III
If you want to repair your old house, you can get help from the county.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.
At the beginning of the information session, Schindler gave a further review of the events to date.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation zone I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the aid.
The Commission also notes that the aid amount is not limited to the amount of the aid granted to the beneficiary.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to carcinogens at work.
On 4 April, the Government Office in Karlsruhe informed the public that a new area for rehabilitation III was to be created.
The total amount of the grant is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 comes from the Land, the remainder from the municipality.
How does a reclamation area come into being?
The Commission has already taken the initiative of setting up a European network of information centres.
But it also matters whether there is any interest in redeveloping the area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG was represented on Wednesday night by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
The Commission has also proposed that the new rules be amended to take account of the new legislation on the protection of the environment.
The programme focuses on the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions, and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on a per-site basis, i.e. per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then be finally defined as a statute.
The period of validity of the financial assistance shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
The first survey, however, was to be carried out by September of this year, and the participants in the rehabilitation area would be given a questionnaire to fill in.
The decision on the statute should be taken in November or December, if possible, so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess the urban design flaws and decide when and to what extent they will be remedied.
A land register entry for the respective plot will then also be made.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the right to decide on the matter.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.
The Commission will therefore be sending questionnaires to citizens in the coming weeks by post, which can be completed after the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the 'building and land register', which includes information on the structural condition and the intentions for renovation.
The grey questionnaire, the "household and housing questionnaire", provides information on the size, layout and occupants of a dwelling.
The blue 'operating sheet' is only to be filled in if the building is used for business premises.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
Furthermore, new construction projects are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works on the "wind dog" principle - first come, first served.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used for the purposes of the common agricultural policy.
Finally, photographs of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the renovation "tasteful" to those present.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip that allows him to open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a flick of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to modify the locks on houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House 's advertising costs are costing the taxpayer thousands of dollars .
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month is costing taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military figures leaked to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter's presence in a fragmented order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual high visibility event", the HMX-1 commander wrote to his superior, the deputy naval aviation commander, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the 3:00 p.m. event at approximately 7:00 a.m. on July 17th, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m. that evening.
The memo adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the reduced hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.
"One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case", the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked in", replied the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a push for health care reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to rein in government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for political advantage is hardly a new phenomenon.
The President is obliged to use it for travel.
But to require their use for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was used as a taxi service in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of posts complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made In America' show - which features products from all 50 states, made by American workers with American materials", said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to drop the President of the United States in the White House with precision cubic feet.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 drill landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted toward the flight crew's training requirements for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day on "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers were not responsible for any of the other props that were presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had no involvement in displaying the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
The Department of Defense (DoD) has also provided the US Department of Defense (DoD) with a "Customer Service" rating for the VH-3D.
Unit records record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers of estimating the refund rates is highly misleading", said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget".
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for the DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week", Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I suspect that hundreds, if not thousands of people are depending on them.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked so hard for.
It is, of course, appropriate to emphasize this".
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter as he entered his roundup of the South Lawn for the event, but he did sit in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "I have three of them".
T BWC nose from tricky task
The top seed in the second division, Suchsdorfer SV, will be competing in the third place match.
The TC Blue and White Neuss will be in Kiel tomorrow at 11 am at the third place Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games of still flawless record, the top-ranked player in the second tennis league has retained his sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
I think the team is very good in the back positions".
The main factor contributing to the class and stability of the Suchsdorfer SV is the import from the far north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to Davis Cup appearances.
And they are also strong in the doubles", says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all from Denmark).
"This is going to be hard for us, as it always is.
You need a good dose of luck, too".
The Neuss team is practically ready for the trip to the far north.
His debut for Blue and White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in the Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who has never been defeated, was on the court with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the opportunity to vote on the draft budget.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also rejoin the team.
If that's not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the world junior rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How OMV can harm America
Donald Trump did not look happy when he signed the bill to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to pass the law", he said, Congress had wrapped up some "unconstitutional regulations".
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was furious at the US move.
The draft, after all, provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
The same concern has been expressed by investors in the domestic OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 with other European companies.
The threat is overwhelming.
However, it was too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to resurrect the sanctions by executive order.
He has 12 weapons to choose from.
"Die Presse" looked at which could deter the group and which could really hurt it.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is the focus of the hit Netflix series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one receiving its first trailer and featuring the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful patrons, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1st.
The city is hiring 46 kitchen assistants
The city is organizing the day care lunch again.
With regular contact for the kids and a team assignment.
In urban day care, the clock is ticking backwards.
As of 1 September, the city of Krefeld is taking over the food supply in the city's day care centres (kitas) again.
This is good news for Sonja Pommeranz, assistant director of the Youth Services Department: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the home: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food chilled.
The city has 46 day care centres in the Krefelder area, and in 44 of them children receive a hot lunch.
Last year, there were 2,800 children at the table, and the demand is growing.
"Meanwhile, it is not just children who are in care for 45 hours a week who eat lunch at the daycare centre", explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care, if children stay until 2 pm".
46 parttime workers will be working in the kitchen from 1 September: they will warm the food supplied, add salad, raw food and fruit, serve the meal individually, serve the food, clear the kitchen, wash and clean it.
"The workers are assigned to a fixed day care", says Pommeranz.
The size of the facility - there are two-group facilities as well as seven-group facilities - determines the number of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now a permanent part of the Kita team", says Pommeranz, satisfied.
"This makes them much more involved and makes it easier for the nursery to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that's what it's all about, too: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"Let the children help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is useful.
For the children too.
"They have a known power in the cradle, a person they know, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kitchens - which has also been the task of the kitchen staff - will now be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only improved the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm of having turned out to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between self-direction and outsourcing, according to the press office.
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being re-hired.
"But these hours are not so important for the 750 or so people in the educational sector", says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN mission, said hundreds of women will be running in the provincial council elections, three women are running for the vice-presidential role and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international combat operations to a consultative role.
This year's elections will mark the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered to vote out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
The TV anniversary walk
To celebrate its 110th anniversary, TV Kaiseringen invites you to a small hike followed by coffee and cake.
The walk starts on Sunday, July 9th, at 1 pm in Frohnstetten by the water reservoir on the America road.
From there it goes to the airfield, to the Natter and back to the reservoir.
The hike takes about an hour and a half.
After that, in the schoolhouse in Kaiseringen, there is coffee, cake, cold drinks, sausages and cheese rolls.
If you need a ride from Kaiseringen to Frohnstetten, the meeting point is at the school in Kaiseringen.
Men trying to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men confronted the 13-year-old, who was with friends on Kolping Street, at around 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused and went on with her friends.
One of the assailants tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but failed.
Without any loot, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB's concern about investment in the McVitie plant in Glasgow
A union wants to ask managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea Biscuits.
McVitie's owner Pladis said he's invested more than £5 million in the past few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "express its concern that the financing for the modernisation of production lines is not being advanced".
GMB senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the General Site Manager on Tollcross's business needs and investment plans for the future is deeply concerning for our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, in the context of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Brexit, rising costs of living and chronic production decline, the east end of Glasgow is in dire need of a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie.'
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: 'The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued commitment of staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with the staff that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our businesses and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: 'In recent years we have invested over £5 million in our toll-cross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know".
Did PSG Barcelona warn you about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record heist three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club is set to break the world record by more than doubling the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89m last season.
After the end of the contract, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering salaries of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to look after him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players", said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, there will be consequences".
Barcelona seem to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian international to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in front of property number 30 in Königsfelder Straße, causing damage to the vehicle's lining of over 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, is asking for clues.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
As a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to make a detour and hit the road.
On Thursday evening, the 34-Year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was in his VW about 19.55 on the B 215 coming from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car met him on his lane, so he had to turn to the right.
The Touran driver touched the board.
There was some damage to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without caring about the traffic accident.
According to the victim, it's possible that the Mercedes driver didn't even notice the accident.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the polluting vehicle to contact the police station in Stolzenau on 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger" by the German newspaper
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases exonerates the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.
So says author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domespatzen continues to generate discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", told the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and now Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be a great help to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own failings or their misjudgement of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, however, criticized the "double standard" in reporting on violence among the Domestic Church.
Regarding the Regensburg attacks, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future, but the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee, notes that "the degree of media manipulation" is striking.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal", writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also told the Bavarian Radio: "You like going to church and it's a foundation".
She also noted that in her youth, "beating was a normal educational tool" to "deal with naughty children like me".
She feels that it would be unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, for the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, the pope's brother, Georg Ratzinger, often appeared.
Quite rightly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger authored the memoir "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger", says Hesemann, "because none of this had anything to do with him", he says, evaluating the findings of the final report.
What exactly is contained in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg to investigate the matter?
In total, 547 Regensburg Domspars were victims of "high plausibility" assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 of them were sexually abused.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that in many cases, forms of physical and mental violence were used by the cathedral choirmaster R.
Especially when emotions were high, the punishment for the students could be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite the violence".
In an interview, Hesemann explains why he thinks the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg church sparrow Georg Ratzinger is exonerated.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against the guards of the Regensburger Dom" gives a contradictory picture of the cathedral's conductor, Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became handy when a Domspatz did not produce top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is even mentioned in it.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at the pre-school was also outside his sphere of influence.
He can be blamed for not knowing about it too late or for not taking the first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzen Gymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students give him an excellent report, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent", and "comprehensive", as a very good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies, and candies, and was "always surrounded by bunches of children".
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to outbursts of anger.
He admitted years ago that he not only banged chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also slapped ears and pulled the hair or ears of very rude boys, and he deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To save his honor, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960's and 1970's, both among parents and teachers.
Do you know any other methods of punishment?
Of course, I think any of us born before 1968.
I too have had this experience in a secular school, a public high school.
The Commission has already taken a number of initiatives to ensure that the European Parliament's powers are not compromised.
One wonders if it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as brother of Benedict XVI. that many media have just rushed on him.
Many who have never understood the Bavarian pope are still working hard to understand him.
The truth is that the report absolves Georg Ratzinger of all responsibility!
The media have been very vocal about the abuse of the Regensburg Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Does the final report also accuse Mr Ratzinger of any involvement or complicity in the sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: It is a clear no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claimed to have confided in the cathedral's choirmaster.
Not even the parents were aware.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it", said one sufferer on behalf of the others, "it was all very embarrassing for me".
The real problem with educating about sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not confide in their parents or siblings, they certainly did not confide in a choir director who was a fellow professional of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One student interviewed put it this way: "As far as sexual abuse is concerned, I don't see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely knowledge and stopped the perpetrator.
I think it is absurd to assume that boys have opened up to him more openly than to their parents, schoolmasters, trusted teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable".
The report concludes very clearly: "The fact that the students and/or their environment who were affected in the run-up to the event confided in him could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be excused from any participation.
So he cannot be accused of not having prevented or reported it.
So there is no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as has unfortunately been the case in some cases.
The media was full of "Gewaltexzessen" (Gewaltex excesses) at the Regensburg Domsparzen.
The former cathedral choirmaster, Georg Ratzinger, is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with that accusation?
Michael Hannesem: This is the big problem, that in the reporting everything has been mixed and blended into a huge blend of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what the report is being misused for.
The Commission has not yet taken any action to ensure that the newly created European Union is not only a European Union, but also a European Union of the peoples of Europe.
The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible educational system for the use of physical violence, the cases in which boys were harassed and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have existed.
But the choirmaster Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
Most of the witnesses stressed that the subject of preschool was taboo.
One was just lucky to be out of it and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different about the Dompatzen Gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And so it is with Georg Ratzinger, for whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite the violence".
At the very least, you'll be accused of looking the other way.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only identify two periods during which it was informed of conditions in the pre-school.
The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and did not want to hear about the activities of a school in which he was not involved and was not responsible (the witness said) and then again only in 1993.
Georg Ratzinger was consistently deaf to the facts?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the headmaster of the Domspatz Gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it he advises the latter "that the use of corporal punishment in preschool education is to be continued".
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Parliament is informed of the Commission's intentions.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity was present, when beatings were also long since outlawed in Bavaria.
Before that, they were in a legal grey area, as any of us will remember.
It was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked the other way.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that flogging was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
What do you think?
Michael Hesemann: We historians talk about the "falling-trap of anachronism", the danger of judging the past by today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has always been abhorrent, nor to the abominations and violence committed against innocent children in preschools, which went far beyond the usual practice of the time.
This is all very horrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked on.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because none of this had anything to do with him.
His methods of discipline and punishment, such as slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were common in the 1970's.
When physical punishment was banned, he strictly adhered to it.
What image of his Regensburg days did Georg Ratzinger portray in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of corporal punishment brought up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, and the Dom's sparrows were only a supporting role.
I'm not hiding the fact that he was a tough guy.
But it must be said that without this perfectionism, without the insistence on unconditional discipline, it would have been difficult for him to turn the Regensburg Domspatzen, which was until then more nationally known, into a world-class institution, a true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition, which toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
Cookies and candy alone do not make great singers of rebellious boys and any success, no matter in what field, but always discipline, passion and self-transcendence.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply religious and good-hearted person, who you can't imagine could do anything to harm even a fly.
I regularly hear how many former parish priests still keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family, 23 years after his retirement.
So those who still do not forgive him for being harsh with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the Dompates are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect, to whom they still look up and whom they almost adore.
And again, let me be clear: all that is being accused of him are parenting methods that were the order of the day.
We can be glad that we have long since passed that time.
But it's unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that just came out, it exonerates him.
Now decency would command that a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without whom outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally be left alone.
